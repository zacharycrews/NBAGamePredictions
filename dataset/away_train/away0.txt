I was just about to do the very same thing graphically. It looks perfect, bro'!👍Brooklyn Nets- A James Harden hamstring injury cost them a shot at last years finals so a full season of Harden and Kd should put them in the 1-2 seed. Kyrie is the wildcard here, smart money would move him but the addition of Patty Mills in the off season will help at PG.I’m picking the Brooklyn Nets to win the NBA championship 

Have to think they’ll be able to trade Kyrie for at least a good role player who fits their teamAnother quest for what a few years ago would have felt like the most unlikely ring in sports starts tonight!

@BrooklynNets @ @Bucks at 7:30 on @NBAonTNT@SamQuinnCBS Miami Heat over Brooklyn Nets...with or without Kyrie IrvingI have the Bucks and Nets neck and neck without Kyrie. I lean Brooklyn by the slimmest of margins. With Kyrie, I'd say something like 75-25 in favor of Brooklyn. The hardest part for Brooklyn is that I suspect Game 7 is in Milwaukee, but I trust KD in that setting.The NBA season is nearly upon us as Dallas Mavericks guard Luka Doncic and Brooklyn Nets forward Kevin Durant are favorites to win MVP.

While the @Lakers will look to replicate their dominance in Search on the court, the @Bucks will begin their title defense, and the @BrooklynNets and @warriors start the quest for their own championship runs.

Although the Lakers pose an obvious threat, it’s hard to see past the Brooklyn Nets who look stacked in every department.

Regardless of Kyrie’s situation, I believe KD and James Harden have enough pieces around them to win it all.

Kyrie instantly boosts the Spurs’ on-court production and removes a distraction for Brooklyn. A package featuring White/Young/Poetlt and picks still keeps the Nets in the hunt.
