    "449": "@Davedaviddave12 @advogado_lucas @trailblazers Whatever makes you happy bro",
    "450": "@FungaiJay @advogado_lucas @trailblazers Yea, he\u2019s really good at tip ins and layups. Not like he was hitting jump shots or creating his own buckets. Bunch of garbage points in a blow out",
    "451": "@Davedaviddave12 @sayithowisis @ImNotBrownImTan @ProlificRomo @CanadianFreak @advogado_lucas @trailblazers You would think the Trailblazers won anything in the last 30 years to justify your passion.",
    "452": "@Davedaviddave12 @advogado_lucas @trailblazers Bro, we don\u2019t mind being a lottery team this year. We\u2019re rebuilding after a ten year playoff run that included a championship. What has the Blazers done since the 70s? \ud83e\udd21\ud83e\udd21\ud83e\udd21",
    "453": "@slimsthereaper @trailblazers @bosnianbeast27 @CarMax Big boy? He let a backup center score 31 .... Time to ship his ass back to Bosnia ASAP!",
    "454": "@Davedaviddave12 @advogado_lucas @trailblazers Dropping every night yet he put up 21/7/4 last night \ud83e\udd21\ud83e\udd21\ud83e\udd21",
    "455": "@Davedaviddave12 @ImNotBrownImTan @Alphabizzle @ProlificRomo @CanadianFreak @advogado_lucas @trailblazers Again, we never played a home game last year - maybe part of the problem with our record last year? But you know your sports right - home court advantage means absolutely nothing?",
    "456": "@FungaiJay @advogado_lucas @trailblazers Raptors lol, another L! I bet sixers, easy money. I feel bad for U, did u really think they were good? I can\u2019t think of a worse team in the nba besides the thunder",
    "457": "@StevieCozens @bosnianbeast27 @KlutchSports @trailblazers @ripcityproject Idk if it\u2019s changed in the last couple games but I had seen recently that his screen assists were the highest in the league too. Chauncey clearly values his screen and roll gravity to his high post playmaking. Explains the turnovers too since it\u2019s all coming on the move",
    "458": "@CanadianFreak @Alphabizzle @sayithowisis @ImNotBrownImTan @ProlificRomo @advogado_lucas @trailblazers Raptors would trade Pascal and Barnes for Frank, in a heart beat. Just to get rid of pascals awful contract.",
    "459": "@Davedaviddave12 @advogado_lucas @trailblazers I hate to break it to you but every single player that has had the type of numbers he has had in the first ten games has had a hall of fame career. And I have no idea where you\u2019re getting this theory that he gets into foul trouble, he doesn\u2019t. And I said he\u2019s a candidate not ROY"
