This statement up above isn’t kind nor accurate to say. 

Joe Tsai should have never said that about Kyrie. He deserve just as much respect as Joe Tsai..

I do not stand with You Kyrie Irving and see no reason why not.Shout out to all the Hebrew descendants still @BrooklynNets followers! #trippers Just trade @KyrieIrving or release him!

Don’t think they play D too much.

His game should be complimented just in case he wants a Nets jersey this summer. Tell him he’d look fire in the Basquiat color ways and let the starting point guard play him up close from start to finish one one one. @KDTrey5 @BrooklynNets @joetsai1999The Nets beat the Clippers 110-95. Brooklyn improves to a 6-7 record. Los Angeles goes down to a 7-6 record.The black community rules everything — but they have fooled some of us to believe we don’t have power because we don’t dominate with wealth…

Don’t believe me.. Boycott the NBA, Nike, Adidas, Amazon, Brooklyn Nets, Walmart, Apple, Google, ESPN, TNT, Fox — and see the changes https://t.co/p2Pi8LhsRXChances are AD will have Bron’s role if he doesn’t play, so treat him as if he were Bron on every possession. AD can go crazy if he gets hot so don’t even let him get warm.
