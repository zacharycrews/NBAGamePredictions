When I finally got in a lot of the cheaper tickets had gone, I did pay a fair wack but not close to £370.@Pistonsfanpage2 @daniellabruce_ @Pistonsfanpage2 is that so... remember your team plays in the same arena.  The @DetroitRedWings didn't have to allow the @DetroitPistons to delay the LCA project by 6 months but did b/c neighbors and friends get along.  Larkin is the 37th C,-like it or not.
