#NorthwestDivision #OklahomaCityThunder #WesternConference https://t.co/fkiiLcKOiQNBA news: the Milwaukee Bucks want to open up more playing time for Jevon Carter and MarJon Beauchamp. 

They’re going to listen to calls on Grayson Allen as they believe they already have the depth to replace him.“The Bucks’ interest in Crowder is well known, and Milwaukee has called numerous teams about Grayson Allen’s trade prospects, sources said.”

Interesting little note here. https://t.co/GgoEFLI4hENovember 11, 1993: Rony Seikaly had 33 PTS (14-23 FG) &amp; 13 REB and Steve Smith added 24 PTS &amp; 7 AST in Miami’s 116-103 win over Milwaukee.

Ken Norman led the Bucks with 30 PTS &amp; 9 REB. Todd Day scored 21 PTS.
