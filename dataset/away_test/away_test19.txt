Who cares at this point. This team better have a plan B if they don't get a top 3 pick because ur now approaching an Orlando Magic decade rebuild real quick.I think tonight’s @OrlandoMagic game Vs the Hawks will tell a lot about the mindset of this team. You can’t have Murray trying to punk your #1 draft pick in the summer Pro-Am circuit and not try to bust their ass tonight! Hopefully Paolo’s teammates take tonight personally too!@OrlandoMagic Can we get these?!? https://t.co/ch2Ce8AOXGCole Anthony (illness) participated in the @OrlandoMagic’s shootaround in Atlanta this morning.

What about you?@vincebaccala @MarkelleF @OrlandoMagic real oneeeeeePretty sure he price of being a Yankees, LA Galaxy, and Manchester United fan in my youth is being exacted as a young adult.

Unfortunately, this twist of fate hasn't suddenly turned the Syracuse Orange, Orlando Magic, or Tennessee Titans into dynasties in exchange.The #Lakers are in talks for a three way trade that involves sending LeBron to the Sacramento Kings, Russel Westbrook to Orlando Magics and Anthony Davis to the near by mall to buy more street clothes. #LakeShow@El_Brauliangas @MarkelleF @OrlandoMagic @DanteMagic @steelemagic Appreciate it bro!@Tha_Main_3v3nt @MarkelleF @OrlandoMagic @DanteMagic @steelemagic I'm literally in the same section 😂💯Swae Lee 😮‍💨🔥 , Orlando Magic’s RJ Hampton, 5⭐️ ESPN Top 6 (#1 PG/247Sports) Isaiah Collier, Migos Manager Rel Money!!  @overtime @OvertimeElite @TopNews128 #RamoneKnows https://t.co/rXJZ7eWMGXReady to see how game # 2 goes for my hawk’s tomorrow against the Orlando magic@RapSheet The Carolina Pamthers are the Orlando Magic of the NFL...
