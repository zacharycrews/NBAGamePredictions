@ Cleveland 2 years ago and @ Washington tonight 
Both games he didn’t play 😡Out of the 7 games only game he didn’t cover he shot 1-14. In 31 games vs MIA Beal has averaged 20.8 Points! SGs this season vs Heat: Booker 27, Rozier 22 (2), Simmons 25, Hield 25, Huerter 22 &amp; 27, Trent Jr 23. Almost every SG has been over 20.5 points vs Miami this season.Brandon Williams has signed with the Miami Heat on a 5 year, $220 million dollar dealThe Miami Heat are looking to bolster their front court depth.

They have looked into trading for Jae Crowder or Jarred Vanderbilt but are not desperate to make a move.

#HeatCulture #FinsUp #MakeItMiami@stoolpresidente Agree, if we're going to have football in Texas and Miami in 100 degree heat, we should have it in a snow globe in Buffalo.@SenorDesigner College ball three teams: UNC, Miami, Marquette 

NBA: Miami Heat

You?@MiamiHEAT Pls don’t lose to the Wizards. They will compete for a playoff spot with us.@jakesgraphs fun fact: former timberwolf jimmy butler plays for the miami heat. so should be an extra fun game on monday!@dubuheatflukes @MiamiHEAT pleaseeeee 🙏Check out this listing I just added to my #Poshmark closet: NBA Miami Heat youth jersey. Size M. Number #15 Tirone.. https://t.co/umY2LYJfUI #shopmycloset @poshmarkappWord is the $SHIB team is actively seeking to acquire the naming rights to the Miami Heat Arena. 

Is @NBA willing to do business with crypto again?@LeBatardShow @MiamiHEAT @Danny0716 Love it, what do you mean by that?Crazy how the Bills have to play in 100+ Miami heat but the second we get snow the game gets moved for “pUbLiC sAfTeY”. It’s not even going to be snowing at game time. Put a winter coat on, you’ll be fine 🤡@MiamiHEAT gonna miss the winning videosSince twitter is dying I can finally confirm that I’ll be playing PF for the Miami Heat https://t.co/yL3GAY8syR@BuffaloBills So we're clear.
Miami makes opponents bake in the shitty Florida heat, but you move a snow game to a dome@MiamiHEAT Heat should follow me back for the time before twitter shuts down@Rathbomb She was all over twitter when wade/heat were playing raptors in playoffs.  Celebrated a win way too early only for raps to come back. I told her to “Shush”. She stuck her followers on me for being a misogynist. I said I clapped back because she’s a miami fan lol.

https://t.co/0bHSobNhBVWhen the Miami heat lose a game my girlfriend has to lock my gun awayYeah miami fans being real shitty people over sports . I forgot how terrible they were . When the heat had lebron they were the WORST ! https://t.co/VljGrcuTs3The NFL takes every opportunity to screw the Bills. How can you take home field advantage because of snow storm but not because of the heat in a stadium designed to have the sun on hot days to the disadvantage of the visiting team the first Bills game verses Miami! It’s just BS.! https://t.co/IrKHxTahoo@Zachppp Same this where i argue with my fellow heat fans and also trigger my fellow heat fans with my ridiculous heat trades and miami heat opinions 😂😂@NickDePaula When will  the miami  heat store will have the athletic  bam jersey  city  edition@HeatvsHaters I guess no more fighting and no more ridiculous tweets of mine regarding trades. How i think some players suck who i think miami should trade for during the season. No more live tweeting heat games 😐where da fuck am i suppose to go to let my frustration out during heat games😒WHY ARE THERE BIRDS HERE? I thought they had a super advanced communication system that tells them “yo dawg time to bounce to Miami for the winter…” and yet HERE THEY ARE. Also: noisy af. Sound like a strangled crow mating with a cat in heat. https://t.co/ZahxPPQJWSI don't have friends in real life who are into the NBA and share my love for the Miami Heat so I'm on twitter because I like the Heat pages here but if twitter will be gone....where can I get updates/interact with you all again #HeatNation #HEATCulture ??@HeatNationCom Let's do it @MiamiHEATVIDEO: Hawks vs. Heat: Who Will Come Out on Top in the Southeast Division? | The Bill Simmons Podcast

They bought the naming rights for the @MiamiHEAT arena back in March of 2021 for $135 million. The stadium is now called FTX Arena.

They also struck a sponsorship deal with MLB to get all umpires to wear their FTX logo during games. https://t.co/OYUdopBvmPThis Ronaldo his Lebron Miami Heat era 🙏🔥 https://t.co/8JDb0ONoGQ@girdley These are the big ones FTX and Theranos. In the crypto space, the best is yet to come. As the tide rolls out. Easy money is easy. once things heat up, that's when you see the real people behind this stuff. No worries the mayor of Miami calls it the capital of Crypto.So you don’t move the bills vs. Miami game with life threatening heat but you move the bills vs. browns games bc of the possibility of a little snow???Like a man who was just dumped, the Miami Heat need a rebound...
