June 4 - FTX signed a reportedly $135 million sponsorship deal for naming rights of the Miami Heat's home court.

July 1 - FTX signed a deal with an option to buy embattled crypto lender BlockFi for up to $240 million.@TheBIGAL94 @HeatNationCom Good call. And you have exactly identified Miami heat's new defensive scheme. Trying to contest the mid-range is the number one foul defenses commit. The mid-range is also the lowest percentage shot in the game. Due to our weakness at the four yet again spo has a solution.I can accept Jack Harlow but wtf Khaled got nominated for being a good fan for Miami Heat ? https://t.co/RJTH7v8oASALERT: New high roller bet posted!
