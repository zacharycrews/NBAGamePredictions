Phoenix Suns fans you got no reason to be cocky about game one of the regular season when you got beat in game seven of the playoffs by 30So like, the Phoenix Suns were the best NBA team for 80% of last year and that’s basically irrelevant now, and that’s normal. 

But put that in context of a race car driver like Kyle Larson or Tyler Reddick or whoever and it’s a controversy that their success isn’t rewarded@RotoNarratives I mean Phoenix Suns@bod_republic Rain don beat me
