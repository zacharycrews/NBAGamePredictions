SMHThe sun just came out and I just realized this is the first time I’ve seen the Sun since I left Phoenix Tuesday😂Where is Phoenix taking a majority of their shots? The highest frequency of shots are coming in the mid range and corner threes. Both ranking 3rd and 4th in the NBA. When looking at shots taken at the rim frequency, the Phoenix Suns almost rank dead last in the league!Since the last update (Nov 9), the Suns continue to produce on the offense end, ranking 6th in pts/poss. The #Suns need to improve in the FT department, ranking 29th in the league. Defensively, Phoenix ranks 27th in pts/poss.If Harrison Barnes ends up on my team, I’m ending my affiliation with the Phoenix Suns#PhoenixSuns mid Nov.
