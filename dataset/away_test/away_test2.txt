https://t.co/ALNA0nUN9V@cmjo1251 So then why are you interested in watching more Orlando nationally televised games? The Magic have also been blatantly tanking for the same amount of time and were worse than the Thunder in each of the past two seasons.

✮ Paolo Banchero o14.5 pts

- I expect The #1 pick to immediately step into a scoring role for Orlando. The Magic need a go-to scorer on the roster, and Paolo looks to be elite in that department. Let’s see what the rookie has in the bag.

Here's what's next.  https://t.co/AdUsZ2DmFiRookie of the Year: Paolo Banchero, beginning his career with the Magic, I already expect Paolo to act as the #1 option for Orlando, he has much upside as a scorer, creator, and playmaker, while some people are betting on Keegan Murray, I believe he has too much comp in SAC. https://t.co/r5NNMhTP5C@OrlandoMagic I feel like @RjHampton14 would be proud of my turtle neck.@OrlandoMagic @FieldsAuto @franzboogie @TerrenceRoss Love the throw back magic shirt!! I want one!!This is how I imagine  Orlando Magic fans  https://t.co/PnNP6BLyz4Orlando Magic

They should be set in the front court for the foreseeable future. Carter, Banchero, and Wagner is a really good trio up front. If the Magic can get their backcourt situation settled they should be back in playoff contention very soon. https://t.co/YsVXAlDoLSStill more rings than the @OrlandoMagic 🤣 https://t.co/EAbWzlBWoo@OrlandoMagic Lol hs yearbook photos@OrlandoMagic Yeah, but who actually had a 90s laser school photo? https://t.co/5PI0sA0YR9@Pp_doesit Ima need you and the @OrlandoMagic to take care of these @celtics Saturday night..
