Why do people in Utah love the Utah Jazz? Because they’re the UTAH Jazz. UT fans take pride in THEIR state’s team.

Why don’t people in New Orleans love the Utah Jazz, despite the Jazz starting in NO? Because they’re the UTAH Jazz now. Tap into local pride.@utahjazz @CollinSexton02 GO.

Jazz fans should rather root for a team that is building a winning mindset. Tanking teams never come out of tanking.

The Utah Jazz have good enough players defend Jokic. Even if the Nuggets win it won’t be by double digits. Being short handed is not a weakness for this team, we have great bench players that know how to prove themselves. https://t.co/nHcYFUywztLakers News: The Utah Jazz Trade The Ringer Thinks L.A.

Now, I pretend to have patience.@PackripEwing @intangible_eth Got one more today, one more to go... @utahjazz @The_Jazz_Lounge https://t.co/3imhyvqunf@_Dxxzy @_silo3 @CourtsideFilms @Thortontucker Utah Jazz point guard Mike Conley shoots 38% to 40% for 3-pointers effortlessly. 😄😄😄 Gives his 2-Guard plenty of freedom on the ball because Mike Conley can make catch &amp; shoot 3-pointers. Perfect point guard for THT.Who else thinks that Lauri Markkanen is going to make the All Star Game? He is such a great team player in addition to his incredible skill.
#NBA #TakeNote #utahjazz@BrooklynNets suck ...really really suck...having @KDTrey5 and @KyrieIrving doesn't help them at all...i don't see them finishing higher then 6th in the east ...to me even @utahjazz are a better team then thenIf you don't like the new Utah Jazz Jerseys it is time to face it, you are just old and change is hard.   #TakeNote  #tankNoteUtah Jazz: Rudy Gay, Simone Fontecchio enter health and safety protocol https://t.co/RDHE4f6IYbscrew these - the utah jazz, final answer https://t.co/IC8wxbG2kF@natehales96 @JordanClarksons @mconley11 @KellyOlynyk @JVando @utahjazz Good luck!Hey guys I need a lot of help to reach this! @JordanClarksons @mconley11 @KellyOlynyk @JVando @utahjazz @JerseyFlock https://t.co/Xzg6lyOQVG@utahjazz @ZionsBank Say it louder for the ppl in the back … well said !!!
