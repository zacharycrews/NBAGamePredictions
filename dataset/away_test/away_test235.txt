Rest is the best cure there from what I understand.
We might not see Carter for a few weeks?@Magic_PR @OrlandoMagic I mean, they just played their first game back, and we basically never put guys returning from injury in the game for a back to back. Please stop acting surprised y’all.Me: No Paolo, no Markelle, no Cole, no WCJ... Why should I stay up until 3 am if I can't even watch our young stars?

The Orlando Magic: We still have Suggs, Franz and Bol Bol.

Franz was done on his foul call.@Betsycashmoney @magic_truther Huerter, GTJ, and Vando are definitely not better than WCJ and you could argue better than Brunson as well. No undrafted players in that class are better than WCJ.

These are very high percentage 🤝 https://t.co/BIX8aUPa14@Dan_Savage @OrlandoMagic That was an awful call. So you're supposed to keep track of where your defender is, as you go up to shoot, and make sure you don't trip them@OrlandoMagic Sugs 🥵@florida_407 @OrlandoMagic Its a package. Refs have really been a factor. Been some horrible calls this second half.@OrlandoMagic this is crazy 😭Hey Refs, it’s called a Euro Step. Caruso ran into the path of the offensive player. That’s a defensive foul, not an offensive one! @franzboogie got robbed. @OrlandoMagic #badcall@OrlandoMagic THE MAGIC IS THE REASON THE MAGIC LOSS .
