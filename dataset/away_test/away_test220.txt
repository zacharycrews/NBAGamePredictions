https://t.co/iVc6JuMZqg https://t.co/Tl2YwMloYcThe Brooklyn Nets need to put Ben Simmons at PG and have the offense run through him. He is the only leader on the team. Having him at the backup Center is not helping anyone.

If you watch any Nets Game they literally double or at time triple team KD especially if Kyrie is not on the floor. It’s impossible to double team Steph because you leaving others wide opened. Poole &amp; Wiggins last year made people pay.@BrooklynNets @YESNetwork Free ky and sign a respectable big. Then maybe the team will pull thru with hope??….Kevin Durant's request to be traded from the Brooklyn Nets shook this year's offseason, but ultimately didn't come to fruition. https://t.co/82G5gVWJh8It's no secret the Brooklyn Nets are struggling early in the 2022-2023 season. The Thunder are still struggling with bigger teams and on the interior. 

We thought of a mock trade that we think helps both the Nets and the Thunder. 

Would you do this trade?https://t.co/OBYKDg9lZSBrooklyn Nets at PLUS ODDS in tonight's #NBA game predictions!

#ThaGatewayNews #NBA https://t.co/M6JXnTmwsr@ohthatsnomnom @NetsKingdomAJ @BrooklynNets And Josh primo is a 6’7 point guard so when Ky doesn’t play we can start Promi over Summner lol and Promi can actually shoot unlike Summner@CHold Defeat this present Brooklyn Nets inside Moda Center is mandatory for a team with serious ambitions. Hope it happens!@ohthatsnomnom @NetsKingdomAJ @BrooklynNets Ben isn’t showing any promise that’s why you trade for a big and wing Cam Thomas is not reliable enough for a team that has championship aspirations seth has great trade value right now so I would trade him back to Philly bcuz Thybulle is hardly playingAD: Meeting helped Lakers 'figure this thing out' #Brooklyn #Nets #NBA https://t.co/tSZPTns92L@ericericanderic brooklyn my spot but the nets fuckin suckKevin Durant at peace with chaotic Brooklyn Nets https://t.co/1igN8ah9jw via @Networknews@esemee @HonestRepCanada @kanyewest @KyrieIrving @BrooklynNets Gotta love the Streisand Effect (tm)
