The Charlotte Hornets are going to be without LaMelo Ball to start the season.  They go as he goes, especially offensively.  Points will be hard to come by for the Hornets until he returns as he averaged 20.1 points and 7.6 assistsCharlotte Hornets leading the league for drawing charges😭😭😭😭@Sports_talk_253 I used to be a Charlotte hornets fan but they suck so now I'm a raptors fanIs it Friday yet 🤔🧬🏀 @clt_hornets  #charlottehornets #nba https://t.co/R7BSDK98NaCharlotte Hornets and New York Knicks play basketball today https://t.co/cpTJaZKGANLaker fans y’all are in trouble again.

Pray and fast NOW! #hardouthere!@BleacherReport @NBAonTNT Tired of seeing this dude on social media. If he played for the Charlotte hornets, nobody would even know who he is. Draymond is JAG( just a guy) literally a small piece in the warriors championships.

And then Miles Bridges went and... let's just say the Hornets are going to be awful. But they'll still be fun to watch when LaMelo Ball is on the court.@ryangrammatico I thought the same thing. Must be a Charlotte Hornets fan PTSD.@lettalksport Charlotte Hornets Larry Johnson@Jesuswaswoke @WustinWefferson @TheHoopCentral @WustinWefferson wanted domestic abuser Miles Bridges to get paid a max and strangle all of the Charlotte Hornets cap space. @WustinWefferson believe draymond triple single deserves 25+ million. What a joke. The only reason I’d give him 12 is due to the “winning impact” his givesCharlotte hornets have one hell of a roster … miles bridges beats women &amp; James bouknight has several reckless driving tickets &amp; a DUI ?????Charlotte Hornets:

UNDER 34.5 Wins. They don’t embrace the tank fast enough but eventually trade their guys

Best: Trade Rozier/Hayward/Oubre. Pretend LaMelo is hurt and have an all-time TANK

Worst: More players get arrested, Lavar Ball demands a LaMelo trade, but get #10 seed https://t.co/wsgM5PKdpE@RadarToys NBA Season Opener ...
