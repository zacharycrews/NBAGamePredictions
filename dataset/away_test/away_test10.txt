The Charlotte Hornets are going to be without LaMelo Ball to start the season.  They go as he goes, especially offensively.

And then Miles Bridges went and... let's just say the Hornets are going to be awful. But they'll still be fun to watch when LaMelo Ball is on the court.@ryangrammatico I thought the same thing. Must be a Charlotte Hornets fan PTSD.@lettalksport Charlotte Hornets Larry Johnson@Jesuswaswoke @WustinWefferson @TheHoopCentral @WustinWefferson wanted domestic abuser Miles Bridges to get paid a max and strangle all of the Charlotte Hornets cap space. @WustinWefferson believe draymond triple single deserves 25+ million.

UNDER 34.5 Wins. They don‚Äôt embrace the tank fast enough but eventually trade their guys

Best: Trade Rozier/Hayward/Oubre. Pretend LaMelo is hurt and have an all-time TANK

Worst: More players get arrested, Lavar Ball demands a LaMelo trade, but get #10 seed https://t.co/wsgM5PKdpE@RadarToys NBA Season Opener ...
