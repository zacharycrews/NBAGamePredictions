And while I get it about OKC las night, the #Knicks are so structurally flawed the overreaction is just highlighting that frustration. Playing for a 10th seed is the worst possible plan IMO.@CAPTAINPEARLNYK @EricSaintCroix @NBA_NewYork 2020 got lots of love. I'm not going to rewrite history. If we were that exact same team things would be better than this. 

There will never be uniform patience across the board. Warriors can't even get that.

2 - No, bc she’s a Celtic fan &amp; EXPECTS them to beat OKC. It means nothing to her.@CAPTAINPEARLNYK @NBA_NewYork Knicks fan act they way they do about loses like the one to the Thunder bc it’s a sound reminder that this roster kinda stinks &amp; there’s no clear road to changing that reality at the moment. Not an over reaction…just a hard truth to accept.@EricSaintCroix @NBA_NewYork 1- you think your wife, one single human being is reflective of Knicks or Celtics twitter?

2- did she say the Celtics had a bad win bc they met up so many points to OKC?The New York Knicks have fired Mark Daigneault.@CAPTAINPEARLNYK @NBA_NewYork Lol, no…they weren’t (I live with two of them) unlike Knicks fans…they shrugged their shoulders the entire game bc they expected their team to come back &amp; win…which they did…bc that’s what GOOD TEAMS typically do.Can you guys guess which fanbase this is?
