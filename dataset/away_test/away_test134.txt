So far this anger has more to do with a cultural taboo that is being massaged than it does with what has actually been said by the CelticsYeah

And that's the problem

Why are people having to judge Ime Udoka based off of what the podcasters say

Dylan Roof did some stuff because of what Facebook said

The Boston Celtics had a law firm do an investigation and held a press conference

Why couldn't they say it? https://t.co/mYuDDQRmgHWhat are the best things about the Boston Celtics’ start to the 2022-23 NBA season? https://t.co/ftYLpjZJunHOJE TEM BOSTON CELTICS!!! ☘☘☘
