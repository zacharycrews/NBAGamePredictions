He said that the direction the Jazz took this offseason to rebuild wasn't all that shocking to him.

#TakeNote l @KSLSports https://t.co/v0EAP3HC9oUtah Jazz 🎺

-home opener underdogs!
-shockingly good minutes distribution for the positive players on this team
-7 guys with double digit points
-will obv look good on 16/38 (42%) 3s nights
-everyone needs to chill on the over hype, but you'll have to show up to beat these guysSince @NBAOfficial  league pass doesn't support linux I can't use the pass that the @utahjazz gave me for being a season ticket holder. FML.@jazzarenice @DI0RSKI @utahjazz @Timberwolves @rudygobert27 typical jazz/wolves fan take. i’m a wolves/jazz fan and think both teams lost the trade.@nba what’s up with League Pass? Despite my subscription I can’t make the NBA app or my Roku channel play anything.  Maybe @utahjazz can help me get back to rooting for my team?

Rudy Gobert@JazzNationNews Wow!  our own JazzNation hoping for a losing season!  Degrading the current players by suggesting this!  The current players for @utahjazz aren't going to willing lose for a 14% chance at a #1 pick, and Possibly lose a job at same time. Stop this losing mentality please!@Ben_Dowsett So you think the current @utahjazz players are going to try and lose so they can also possibly  lose a job (position) on their current team when they draft a #1 pick, if the @utahjazz get extremely lucky and get the #1 pick?These jerseys are universally disliked.

At this time, the trade is not imminent.@imageofanewdawn See Rob pelinka got an extension right? Jeanie doesn’t like firing people she’s close with but why can’t we do what the 76ers and utah jazz did which is hire a president who makes the final call on everything.

https://t.co/TjxgmemLqJ@utahjazz Young coaches taking over every league@JabroniKnutson @hansenjames That would increase Utah Jazz’s total salary by $4.8m.

Does that put them over the cap? If so, they wouldn’t not do this trade.

If both picks are coming, Lakers might need Vanderbilt too. And that would even out the salaries as well.Honestly… despite everything… this might be the deepest the @utahjazz have been at point guard in recent memory. @mconley11 @CollinSexton02 @JazzNationCP@hansenjames Depends on what the Utah Jazz FO dares to do.

Trading Conley for Westbrook after that amazing game 1 might not go over well w players &amp; fans.

📱 Download the @kslsports app https://t.co/RD1Jrov3am@Pimmit1 @itsbrooooklyn @utahjazz I get that. But Rudy was the 23rd pick and Donovan was the 13th pick. Both originally Denver's picks by the way too. 

Look at the number 2 pick also. Holmgren looked dynamic early and then he hurts himself and now out for the whole season. Nothing is ever for sure with picks.The Timberwolves are taking on the Utah Jazz tonight at 8 pm est at Target Center. 

Only injury to report is Udoka Azubuike is out for the Jazz with an ankle injury.@utahjazz In 2013 Raptors "tanked" by trading Rudy Gay
&amp; suddenly became a top team.
Jazz tried to tank with elderly Gay &amp;
he puts up 16 pts in blowout win against

#Utahjazz #TakeNote #Timberwolves https://t.co/ktGhMc4P7E@jaehyyunnzz What a win for Nikola Jokic against the tanking UTAH jazz@BolWrld They lost to the Utah JazzI’m sorry, I wouldn’t be in tears if someone falsely accused me of giving blowjobs for Utah Jazz tickets 🤣 https://t.co/x0C1VudcU8@kslsports @utahjazz @Timberwolves I will always love Rudy, jazzman for lifeAs a sports journalism major, my favorite sports teams are @Eagles, @utahjazz and @StLouisBlues  #MCO335@itsbrooooklyn @utahjazz It's not possible to sustain the level of energy they played with for even half a season. Once that energy is gone you have to have very good to great players. They don't have that talent. 15 to 25 wins...that's all they will get.How do I get a @utahjazz  “Vote” t-shirt from the @NBA pro-democracy participation commercial?@RyanQualtrics @carlsokia @kslsports @utahjazz Get some Carl!@colby_colonel @WalkerKessler13 @utahjazz Fire bro 🔥Utah Jazz are currently #1 in west standings per https://t.co/BUSZ696FUu lol https://t.co/2YRYtf5CEIToronto Raptors 108-105 Cleveland Cavaliers

Phoenix Suns 107-105 Dallas Mavericks
Sacramento Kings 108-115 Portland Trail Blazzers@utahjazz having a balanced attack without standing around watching DM dribble, shoot and miss at the end of the shot clock was relieving. #utahjazz #takenoteBy putting an S on the end of it I’ve ruled out Red Sox, White Sox and Utah Jazz@ybisbetterifear Reg season merchant. He has some Utah Jazz DNA inside of him@NDGotLast Jokic got cooked by the Utah Jazz into a 20 point blowout yesterday NDBucks should be in the phone with the Utah Jazz for Jordan ClarksonGo off then Rook! 😤🔥

#GoJazz #Team49 https://t.co/MqOdnNTjyCThe Utah Jazz have hired Tyronn Lue to be their next head coach.I couldn't be happier with the new @utahjazz UK 🇬🇧 profile! Massive shout-out to @JazzUniTracker for the brilliant design! #nba #TakeNote https://t.co/Rqqqj4njTj@BleacherReport He still on the roster? God I hate watching him stand from the bench yelling for a Tuesday night game vs the Utah Jazz like its the the NBA Finals https://t.co/ztKEW3JBXo@utahjazz @CollinSexton02 Love Collin’s tenacity and work ethic!!Timmy,Green and McGee will look great in those Utah Jazz uniforms.

Time to get Sexton from them.@bmsman @itsbrooooklyn @utahjazz I don't disagree with it... But I don't see a point in being a 1st or 2nd round exit either when there's a possibly of snatching up a guy like Wemby. Chances of this team winning a ring are probably smaller than chances of getting Wemby OR another player like Rudy or Mitchell.👍 on @YouTube: UNEXPECTED WIN vs Reigning MVP 😎 | UTAH JAZZ https://t.co/l5nvVE2mHh@utahjazz @CollinSexton02 Collins a favorite he better bring home the Championship...@vanexel31 The reason why I felt in love with basketball and became a laker fan. 1997 vs utah jazz opening gameMinnesota Timberwolves vs. Utah Jazz odds, tips and betting trends | October 21 https://t.co/HsNSsDX4Sb https://t.co/X2L0FiMCTxMy son took a date to the Nuggets/Jazz game 30 years after I cheered on that floor. #fullcircle @nuggets  @utahjazz @tanner_tripp #familiesareforever https://t.co/hav4BmXaeN🐺Wolves fans 🤝 Jazz fans 🎶
