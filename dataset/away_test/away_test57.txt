Nets/Bucks Over 231.5 Points -110

Both teams love scoring a bunch points and not playing much defense. The @Bucks are well rested and should come out with a ton of energy. The @BrooklynNets will need to keep up the tempo in this one.

I had as the top 4, and we’re right there with everyone else IMO. I had Miami falling off a little due to Lowry’s age, and not really adding talent to replace him🤷🏿‍♂️. https://t.co/ansQt7j30s@SportsDespair @hornets @BrooklynNets How many steps to the bathroom?Last Time We Saw Brooklyn Nets Ben Simmons against the Milwaukee bucks a few weeks ago will he Step up Tonight ? #Netsworld https://t.co/8XMkRwT8vpBiggest thing to watch tonight is not Ben Simmons' offense, but how he can defend Giannis. The @BrooklynNets finally have an athletic guard with enough length and quickness to blanket Giannis. Simmons provides major value in that department even if he doesn't score. #NetsWorld@0wen_13 I’d lean nets without middelton that # seems high but you never know what kinda effort you’ll get from Brooklyn so I’m staying away@HD_JacobsTennis @BrooklynNets @oscarmayer @Wienermobile Super cool!Brooklyn Nets vs Milwaukee Bucks

#panodds  #Tips  #bettingpicksLooks like @KlayThompson let someone get under his skin last night! @Bucks and @BrooklynNets tonight…which @BenSimmons25 will we see tonight? This @NBA season is really interesting so far…..Ben Simmons is driving way less as a Brooklyn Net.

He averages 5 a game this season compared to 10.2 in 2020-21.

It’s an indicator of his mentality and lack of confidence, though when he does, good things happen.
