“He’s done a heck of a job with this team. Cliff’s a great coach.” Adds that both teams are still forming an identity at this point in the season. https://t.co/CoozzJPIm5NBA

Being very selective in NBA so far. Waiting until the ten game mark before I start going deeper but I like this spot tonight. Terry Rozier and Cody Martin ruled out.

@nbaunitracker https://t.co/CDVFXCcG9j@MarkJonesESPN @keegan3murray @SacramentoKings How much of him reminds you of Kevin Martin and/or Rudy Gay? I see a lot of Rudy Gay in his style of play.Great talk with @keegan3murray of @SacramentoKings earlier today as the Kings prepare for the first of 4 road games. His skill offensively is impressive. He told me the “Spread 5” they ran at Iowa has made his NBA adjustment easier. Defensively says he’s cool guarding 2 thru 4💪🏽 https://t.co/C1ij7Y3A9sLove the dunks but my favorite thing about @IveyJaden is how he grew up rooting for the @DetroitPistons &amp; @Lions. I was so proud when he Eli'd &amp; Elway'd his way to Detroit -- all but refusing to go to the @SacramentoKings -- because he only ever wanted to be a Piston. https://t.co/MKu1WWpavhNew Overtime AMM position bought

IMHO. Huerter plays like he is a highschooler out there having fun. The flow of the team this year looks better. Sactown needs to tighten up over all play. When they do, they can win any game.Sacramento now knows you can't win if you have a large deficit. Takes too much energy. Nothing given by the Heat. The Kings earned the win with a balanced game.

Miami was sleepwalking throughout H1, but Sacramento has talent to hit the gas pedal against anybody and they did that.

I totally forgot about Chet cuz now we have taller better him to get excited about@seanysean0219 @WorldWideWob @SacramentoKings I was thinking about it regarding the thunder, cause do they really want to pair Victor and Chet if they are still stoked on him.@TheSoccerGoose Kings moved to Sacramento from KC in 85.@iamboyleg @WorldWideWob @SacramentoKings I really don’t know. I’ve never seen anything like victor. I was thinking, “maybe if you already had a victor type, you trade #1” but ya no one has that so idk@seanysean0219 @WorldWideWob @SacramentoKings I've honestly wondered what the return would be with as high people are on Victor to trade to 2 take scoot and something. And say you got like a first or two and scoot how many things would you need for your city not to execute the GM publicly in the streets.Happy birthday to terry Tyler of the Detroit pistons #terrytyler #terrychristophertyler #detroitpistons #sacramentokings #dallasmavericks https://t.co/RbFI1pewiZI Rebuilt the Sacramento Kings in NBA 2K23 🔥🔥 Check it out on YouTube here: https://t.co/xQcUAAMoiX https://t.co/ImG61h7J25@SacramentoKings I love dellys accent@iamboyleg @WorldWideWob @SacramentoKings We will trade him to the Pacers for a non-modern center like we did Hali. The only thing I can count on in my life is the kings fucking up. 

Scoot is dope though I’d love scoot@seanysean0219 @WorldWideWob @SacramentoKings Listen, taking scoot still feels like a win as far as kings decisions go.NBA Basketball Game Simulator: 10/31/2022 7:10 PM ET - Sacramento Kings vs. Charlotte Hornets Game Simulation and Free Picks Generated by Advanced Algorithms https://t.co/zf30Hg6Zr3@iamboyleg @WorldWideWob @SacramentoKings And we have infinity the amount of wins they have.

But also, knowing the kings they will take Scoot@seanysean0219 @WorldWideWob @SacramentoKings I want to express my sincerest joy for you as a kings fan that the Lakers don't own the right to their own pick and can't swoop in and ruin another potential good kings moment like they love to doLos Angeles Kings Logo 1967-75 | 1975-1987

I will instead be cheering for the much better Sacramento Kings. The warriors should be in shame, losing me and others as fans. This isn’t the Warriors, this is the Larriors.

Defense and play execution was much improved in the Heat game. I like Fox doing what the team needed to get the win. Rebounding, finding open shooter. Monk and company got key baskets to help. #KingsWinThis is really starting to piss me off as to how we’re actually trying to win so bad

There’s a literal once-in-a-generational prospect up for grabs next summer and we’re apparently more concerned about being a play in 10 seed

Yup hate to say we’re the new sacramento kings… 🤦‍♂️ https://t.co/nky9rqVaSHThe Kings played a balanced game. Sabonis going with a hard dunk is what the team needs. Letting the open or hot hand shoot the ball. Along with play selection got the win.
