This'll be the weakest defense by far the Clippers have faced. We're 30th on offense scoring 100.7 PPG. If we can't put up more than 110 tomorrow, changes must be made.#Rockets thoughts:

@Jaygup23, @Usmangaruba &amp; @TAR13ASON  have to play more
Make @alperennsengun the fulcrum of of the offence. Always.
