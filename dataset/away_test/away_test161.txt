https://t.co/QRuXz6gjZrIf Trae Young doesn't play tonight against the Utah Jazz the Atlanta Hawks are in trouble. If the Utah Jazz can continue to play at the same pace that they have been all season then it should be a win in the double digits. We'll see, though.

#NBA #sportsbet #sportsbetting #UtahJazz #AtlantaHawks #procappers https://t.co/JzId2uJ6vj@przidnt1 According to CBS Sports, the Utah Jazz who are 9-3 right now have a 57.5% chance of making the playoffs. How does that work? üèÄüòïThe Utah Jazz have won 5 in a row against the Hawks. While this Jazz team looks alot different, they're playing just as well as the team that once had Donovan Mitchell and Rudy Gobert. 

The last time the Hawks won was in March of 2021.@TatesTakeHoops @ATLHawks @utahjazz @ATLjohnson18 Haha good stuff @TatesTakeHoopsis back home, they should be comfortable and ready to perform. I love that I get to fade the Utah Jazz on their first East Coast trip.

The Dallas game is this simple, Paolo Banchero is not playing for the Orlando Magic, that means you take the Mavericks.

The Jazz have started off VERY strong and are coming off a blowout win against the Lakers. 

Comment your thoughts and predictions down below! https://t.co/KnEm2nnQFPThe Utah Jazz have the 3rd most effective offense in the league right now, and they‚Äôre not slowing down anytime soon. The Jazz are shooting almost 40% from beyond the arc, and three pointers are becoming their primary weapon against opposing teams.

They also are 28th in fast break points allowed per game

Yet somehow‚Ä¶ they are 8th in defensive rating

This NBA season is just so weirdThe @utahjazz will put the best record in the West on the line against an Eastern Conference team for the first time this season. 

But, the @ATLHawks might be without a major piece.

#NBA #TakeNote #utahjazz@ColtsGuy505 @ColtsFanCole Nah it‚Äôs not just this season though, even when we had a top scoring defense, his decision making cost us in some spots. It wasn‚Äôt personal at all with Frank being let go. The locker room needed a new voice.

Do the Utah Jazz make any moves or would anyone in the league work with him knowing they could get fleeced?

We need to keep these conversations going - mental health issues affect everyone, they don‚Äôt discriminate but they often lay silent and invisible. We need to keep talking, and we need to be kinder.@utahjazz i miss Lauriüòï@LakeShowYo Call and beg @utahjazz for their entire starting 5.  Offer them anything they want.  It won't work but daaayum will be fun watching Utah laugh them off the call....Leandro Bolmaro and Ochai Agbaji have been assigned to the @slcstars by the @utahjazz

Thoughts?@UtahJazzEspanol @utahjazz @RyanQualtrics @BolmaroLeandro @gabbyhundman @nayocampbell @sportsiren @DLocke09 Thanks!@DavidDJJames The Utah Jazz being 9-3 beating good teams has been SUPER fun. I have watched every game and loved it. I love reacting w other Jazz fans. It‚Äôs been awesome.

The Lakers being good or bad doesn‚Äôt affect the fun-ness of an NBA season for me.@UtahJazzEspanol @utahjazz @RyanQualtrics @BolmaroLeandro @gabbyhundman @nayocampbell @sportsiren @DLocke09 Cracks@Stifle_Tower27 I have a Thabo Sefalosha Utah Jazz Jersey üòÖWill Hardy and his incredible skill at making in game adjustments is what is allowing this Utah Jazz team to win these games. The amount of great players on this team plus Will Hardy's coaching is what is putting the Utah Jazz out ahead this season.
#NBA #TakeNoteim gonna be disgusted if the Utah Jazz wins a ring with this jersey setThe Utah Jazz community is honestly one of the best sports communities on Twitter. The energy from these games really translates to the fans and their reactions on this platform, I love it.
#NBA #TakeNote #UtahJazzThe sheer juxtaposition of external presumption vs. unfurled reality is stark enough to be noteworthy. Even to @UtahJazz players who say they believed in themselves when no one else did. #takenote
https://t.co/PF8G7MMMT4Stil fuzzing about Gobert and Mitchell? Shut the F up.
