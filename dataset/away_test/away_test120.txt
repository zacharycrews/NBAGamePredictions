Hope y’all have had a great week and a terrific weekend!@ZaeMcGuire @MiamiHEAT My thoughts exactly. We’ll need a Tyler masterclass@DennisFiifiD @MiamiHEAT @ManUtd United needed a 2-goal win though. So partially broken.@Tj_italian_305 @GoatBucketz7 @MiamiHEAT Either way Lukas better@petkovski643 @MiamiHEAT Stick to singing oladipo champ@yellow_purp @AP No backbone. If Kyrie played for the @MiamiHEAT he would be donezo as well, @MickyArison don’t play.Wow what a fucking monster, trade him to the @MiamiHEAT (for Kyle Lowry preferably) https://t.co/TZx5VOJNc5@TylerL349 @_PabloHeatin5 @HeatvsHaters @KDTrey5 Yeah, but there is literally no way we'd get Durant. Before, the centerpiece of a deal was Tyler Herro, and now he can't be traded (this season). If that Heat offer wasn't enough before, how could a far lesser trade package from Miami be enough now?@RellyTStro22 Yes I expect him to get by Larry Nance I dont expect to see Miami heat LeBron so take that argument to the next comment.. and Im glad we both kno the real cause of one ur like come from someone who seem to think he got a 🎒@MiamiHEAT @SociosUSA Jimmy to Bam! 🔥@MiamiHEAT y’all know wtf to do dawg https://t.co/6WMyImBXKKTeach him a lesson and send him to the Miami HEAT so he can play for Mickey Arison

Miami fans love you so much which is great ✔When @raf_tyler hit that game winner. @DwyaneWade @MiamiHEAT https://t.co/VYGmuDdQpu@MiamiHEAT try to sign him https://t.co/anJYAeAKPMglad my team not a poverty franchise. i will never disrespect you again @MiamiHEAT@MiamiHEAT let’s go get “unfit” https://t.co/Id6Kg7If2T@MiamiHEAT @CV_250 Remember when Heat fans were happy they got Oladipo 🤣🤣@MiamiHEAT go get that man5 games for Kyrie Irving after pushing an antisemitic documentary. For those that need a reminder, Miami Heat player Meyers Leonard was suspended from all team activities for a week and fined $50000 in 2021. https://t.co/WRrjQLxRPd@C_S__ @HeatTankSZN Nah I know, I wish he wasn’t so opposite Miami culture. They’d go get Chalmers back before Kyrie plays in a Heat jersey.I think he’s a fit for us @MiamiHEAT https://t.co/9IgLW0JDLv@MiamiHEAT go get him! https://t.co/Y8LCRKo1w0@MiamiHeat_Fra We move comme on dit hein@statmuse nets should trade him to miami heat for highsmith so that they can gain some benefit@ThatEricAlper Met Jimmy Buffett after a Miami Heat game decades ago.

I bet the Miami Heat's Pat Riley doesn't care how antisemitic Kyrie is.@MiamiHEAT bring this man home!! https://t.co/ZKb5RoSsAjKEVIN DURANT YOU ARE A MIAMI HEAT https://t.co/lOpbi7lUnYLowry caleb and a first bro get it done @MiamiHEAT https://t.co/a1y5vSNlfI@dolovibes @MiamiHEAT @raf_tyler Yeah he did but no refs gonna call that at the end of the game fr like in person watching it you wouldn't of knew he even traveled you feel meThe Heat suspended Meyers Leonard for what I would describe (perhaps incorrectly, it's certainly subjective) for less. Leonard went on to make significant amends. The Nets were not immediately responsive, unlike Miami. Better later than never I suppose: https://t.co/dgFzgXMHBi https://t.co/4Jgz5kFoWMKyrie, you’re a Miami Heat! https://t.co/V3rL8jUj1eHaslem ass been walking in the the Miami Heat arena longer than the damn janitorsWhat we learned as Dubs lose despite Steph's triple-double
