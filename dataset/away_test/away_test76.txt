Based off of last season, LJ has the edge cause he  was still was 37 years old &amp; avg 30. Neither of them can effectively navigate a team to success, but it's close I agree.

Malone won an MVP at 35, the oldest MVP in NBA history! LJ last mvp was age 27. I would still give LJ the edge due to scoring ability. LJ is a slightly better defender though anemic. Malone at age 37 avg 23pts, age 38 avg.22 pts. Ytbd https://t.co/YLFH7MwlmZChicago bulls NFT fighters for sale! https://t.co/E4tIJ6bMI1
