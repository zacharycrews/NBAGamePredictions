#JazzNation #UtahJazz #TakeNote
#GoJazz #NBA #Team49 https://t.co/yP3YuGR3fjThe Utah Jazz are 6-2. That's very shocking. Perhaps they traded Gobert and Mitchell to be a true contender this year. Seriously though, this team has 6 guys averaging double figures. Any rotation guy can step up and have a great game for them and several have proven that already https://t.co/zMYAKNj3hqYou should probably check out our Jazz vs Mavericks betting props and predictions…

The Utah Jazz have gone 6 - 2, 5 against playoff teams. We have gotten to the point where the Jazz are actually a good team.
#TakeNoteUtah Jazz are actually a good team 

It’s not some flukey start that bad teams have to start off regular seasons.

IF they keep this roster together and actually try their best to win, I think playoff basketball will continue in Utah… https://t.co/xEJ2eBlfuGLuka Doncic is going to be the Utah Jazz’s main priority on defense tonight. The style of basketball that he plays is very unique and difficult to defend. My guess is that Will Hardy will put Lauri Markkanen or Jordan Clarkson on Doncic to try and shut him down.

▪️ San Antonio Spurs
▪️ Portland Blazers
▪️ Utah Jazz
▪️ Oklahoma City Thunder

Guys need to figure it out, as soon as possible.I don’t kno who in the @utahjazz is in charge but how do you trade @spidadmitchell@utahjazz have an intriguing pick for 2023 draft - least fabourable of HOU/BKN/PHI. Very early of course, but PHI is one crisis away from missing the playoffs, and then  lottery is looming. And those Wolves are not so impressive either. #NBANBA picks for November 2nd, 2022. #UtahJazz #sacramentokings 

https://t.co/T6CFAahuKQ@aaaljay @Ballislife @utahjazz @MarkkanenLauri He had all the chances at bulls lol, below averageI certainly was not expecting @trailblazers @utahjazz or @spurs to all be in the top 4 of the West at this point.

If he’s happy just watching the games I wish him the best. But if he’s starting to get that coaching bug 🐛 I pray 🙏 he doesn’t go coach either LA team!!!@vivintarena @utahjazz @PostMalone Not a good look 😬@ClutchPointsApp Easily the Utah Jazz is the most surprising good or bad. 6-2 with 5 of those wins coming against playoff teams (DEN, MIN, NOP, MEMx2) when they were supposed to be a bottom 3 team. Crazy.Not only did the Utah Jazz somehow get out of paying Gobert 47 million at 33yrs old, but also stole 4 first rounders, Vanderbilt, Beasley, and Kessler. And even more with how much they’ve already flipped for more pieces. Robbery by Danny Ainge once again. https://t.co/W5oOa2dRqmDo Utah Jazz fans actually exist?The Suns are the new Utah Jazz@ScottyGZone sir, Great job on the @utahjazz call! I’m chuckling over the joys of fatherhood, and your tanking chat. I was wondering what your son’s expression was when the Jazz came out on fire 🔥 this season! 😆😆 Well son…

#NBA #TakeNote@HHHThe2nd @acidropOSY @nypost Fun coincidence about the Jimmy Kimmel black face was that he was portraying Karl Malone, who played for the Utah Jazz in every season of his career, save for his final season with the L.A. Lakers@toomanybarnabys @NBA @utahjazz Fun fact: yeah.@UrinatingTree I have followed the Utah Jazz since I was a toddler. I’ve attended many home games, including that infamous Game 6 in 1998. They have ripped my heart out more than I care to admit.

I await your Legacy of Failure video on them with great eagerness. #CatharsisIn my opinion Lauri Markkanen would do an incredible job representing the Utah Jazz in the 2023 NBA All Star Game. He obviously knows how to play under pressure and be a great team. Markkanen is probably one ofthe best breakout players in the NBA right now.
