- Rely heavily on 2 great scorers
- Overhyped with mid additions in offseason
- Enough talent to beat down on bad/mid teams
- Get exposed by every good team

It¬¥s a lack of respect.

Neuno and boson has our phone number, our email, our adress, our real name, our wallet,.. so its not like they dont know howto@alexkarabon I love my 1-0 Chicago Bulls@betty_nft @brandontour @guappguap @somera_xyz @chicagobulls @AdamBombSquad @neuno_io Feel sad for the deadfellaz who bought a $1000,- neuno card after it was shilled in DFZ discord calls etc, wasnt "refunded" by boson, and is absolutely worthless by now.
