On Hm Court it's A Must.There has to be A Witches Hex 🧙‍♀️on Kings free-throws.xxKZ Okpala has the potential to be a solid defender for the Sacramento Kings, and looks better when defending smaller guards.

Solid against Damian Lillard who he restricted to just 20 pts but was blown away by Paul George last night who dropped 40+ on his head. 

Curry next 😈Sacramento Kings need a playmaking point guardCoach Mike Brown really has a lot of work to do with this Sacramento Kings team, from their poor spacing to irrelevant turnovers.

And both have coaches who try to trick opponents rather then beat them.@HertlToEklund Dude, lemme tell you. My favorite teams are: SF Giants, Sacramento Kings, LV Raiders, San Jose Sharks. You want to talk about pain? 😥Barnes needs to come off the ball. He doesn't thrive as a 4th option. He needs plays called for him. He could carry the bench unit.

Just watched them go toe to toe with the Clippers. The Sacramento fans are hungry for some playoffs, Fox is clutch, and Keegan Murray is my early pick for ROYClippers were - 2.5 vs Sacramento and were up 5 as a Kings player hit a fadeaway 3 as the clock expired to make the final 111-109. Has to be a bad beat for @SportsCenter w/Scott Van PeltNew season same ol Sacramento Kings.. #SacramentoProudBrutal 3 at the end @SacramentoKings @LAClippers@SacramentoKings fans for the past 15+ years 🤦🏽‍♂️ https://t.co/ZpxegKXkLg🏀 Final Score 🏀

Kings' prized 1st round pick Keegan Murray played every well in his first NBA game, but Paul George ran through Sacramento's defense to lead LA to a 111-109 win. Here are 6 quick thoughts as the Kings dropped to 0-2.Final: Clippers 111, Kings 109. Sacramento falls to 0-2 despite a 36-point game from De'Aaron Fox and a sensational NBA debut from rookie Keegan Murray, who finished with 19 points on 7-of-10 shooting. Paul George from Fresno State had 40 points, six rebounds and six assists.The Sacramento Kings suckMe, the past two decades+ into my @SacramentoKings fandom: https://t.co/LWnzKFPP2GThe Sacramento Kings need a playmaking point guard. Mike Brown better not have my man Sabonis dying out there all season.@JimCrandell Keep the faith Jim. #GOKINGS @SacramentoKings@SacramentoKings best 0-2 team in the league 💪🏽💪🏽 #wesuckFREE F*CKIN THROWS @SacramentoKings@SacramentoKings @kayte_c OK.

Paul George with 30 for LA, De'Aaron Fox with 23. Kings rookie Keegan Murray with 14pts thus far in his NBA debut.END Q3: Clippers 86, Kings 80
George up to 30 for the Clips on 11-22fg. Davion Mitchell has guarded him pretty well recently.

De'Aaron Fox has 23 for Sacramento and another good 3-pt shooting night thus far. 29% 3fg last year, 7-13 3fg so far this year.

Catch the 4th on 570 AM@SacramentoKings @hbarnes is such ass! How the fuck is he starting. He shouldnt even be on the roster and yet he startsIt's all the Paul George show as the 3rd quarter finishes.

De'Aron Fox also tallied in 15, leading the way for the Kings!@SacramentoKings @Dsabonis11 @keegan3murray @swipathefox Great half.  Fox needs to cleanup his FTsHighlights from the Sacramento Kings' 55-52 first half over the Los Angeles Clippers.

FOX - 15 pts, 3 asts, 1 stl
MURRAY - 10 pts, 3 rebs, 1 blk
HUERTER - 8 pts, 4 asts
SABONIS - 7 pts, 7 rebs https://t.co/vsfNvxyg5gGeorge hit back-to-back 3s to end what was a field goal drought of more than 5 minutes. But Fox ended 1st half with a layup, and Kings used 16-6 run to take control of rest of 2nd quarter.

Sacramento leads Clippers 55-52 at halftime.@connor_m30 @SacramentoKings I want to like this tweet but it’s currently at 69… you understandEntertaining game btwn @LAClippers and @SacramentoKings. This is a real NBA opponent, unlike the Lakers. Paul George looks a lot better tonight. Clips down -1 at the half.@SacramentoKings up 3 over the @LAClippers at the half #nbaThe Sacramento Kings will make the playoffs this season.

Turnovers (8) have been an issue yet again for the Clippers despite their 45% shooting overall.

A weekend at 🏡 #Kings #Clippers@rharrington227s @SacramentoKings @NBA @Sactown1140 Spot on brother. Just as crazy that All Lives Matter is unacceptable but all of Mark Jones crazy behavior is ignoredKings went on a go-ahead 9-2 run featuring Davion Mitchell putting Jackson on skates in the midrange and Terence Davis getting a 3 to drop

But another Mike Brown timeout after b2b George buckets, the latter a 3 aided by poor Sacramento transition defense

38-35, LAC, 6:51 2ndQ.It is insane to me that Matt Barnes is on the @SacramentoKings broadcasting team but Grant Napear is not. Absolutely mind boggling! One arrested for domestic violence and the other said “all lives matter” Think about that for a moment. @NBA @Sactown1140Sacramento Kings and Clippers dey the other side dey prepare fire wey them go use roast me 😩@SacramentoKings Splash 💦Always good seeing the old EC classmate @damienbarling on the concourse before the @SacramentoKings game.

I told them the Lakers only needed a point guard from free agency since you got Lebron. 👎The sacramento kings would beat these guys by 50 lmao https://t.co/yloXWKlDPy@SacramentoKings @trailblazers @LAClippers   Kings, you better show her tonight! https://t.co/54RwOQ5tL3@SacramentoKings Show me the starting lineupNew Overtime AMM position bought
