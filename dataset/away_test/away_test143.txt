He is the no doubt the Michael Jordan of football. And we are ruining his last season.

Halftime:

Memphis:57

Washington:43Grizzlies lead the Wizards 58-43 at halftime. The second quarter was ugly, the Grizzlies pounded the paint and couldn‚Äôt miss a three. Adjustments have to be made by the coaching staff. Memphis outscored Washington 28-13 in the second quarter.
