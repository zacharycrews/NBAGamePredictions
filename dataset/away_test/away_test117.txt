#GoldenStateWarriors #PacificDivision #WesternConference https://t.co/qIkU1KXGyDThis year's governor race in Florida is like sending the 2008 Celtics against the 2017 Golden State Warriors and wondering what happened..Matt Barnes deserves all the credit for the Golden State Warriors’ 2017 NBA title.

He carried the team throughout the entire playoffs and almost single-handedly defeated woke pro-China LeBron James in the Finals.

Steve Kerr and Steph Curry owe their rings to Matt Barnes.@warriors Man no way they lose to no damn magic, Steve Kerr may be annoying with his strategies but it’s all for the better. These teams are scared of golden state, that’s why they only play 110% against them and like 70% against other nba teams.
