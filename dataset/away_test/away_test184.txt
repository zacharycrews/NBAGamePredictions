#NorthwestDivision #UtahJazz #WesternConference https://t.co/L5Bw3st8vw@jazz_n8 @utahjazz Haha I was born in 95 so I was really young then haha. And I personally disagree with that, I’d rather make the playoffs. But we all have the right to our own opinion!@SorenFree2195 @utahjazz I'm sorry you didn't get 90s to the finals runs.

10x more fun than this.

You may be right that the Jazz have already won too many games, but keeping themselves in the lottery is WAY better than a 1st round exit.@jazz_n8 @utahjazz Get good players. And this is probably the most exciting team I’ve ever watched. If we make the playoffs and lose in the first round, so be it!I’d be so mad if I was a fan of the Utah Jazz. 

Imagine trading a chance at the best prospect since LeBron James for a first round exit with a bunch of role players and no building blocks.@jazz_n8 @utahjazz Well we aren’t getting Victor with our own pick. Jazz are already way to far ahead of all the other tanking teams and the jazz aren’t going to tear down the roster more just to get a better pick. We have 3 picks in next years draft and the draft is loaded so either way we willEph Alums in Atlanta showed up to support Will Hardy '10 (center front row) new head coach of the Utah Jazz in a game vs. the Atlanta Hawks. The Jazz won 125-119 and now own a 10-3 record. https://t.co/xxmQ3FMl07@SorenFree2195 @utahjazz I would rather add Victor to 1 or 2 players of this group and win a championship.

But, I have only been a Jazz fan since 1992, so maybe "fun" first round exits are good enough?@jazz_n8 @utahjazz Na I’d rather win with this fun group!@SpencerKeele @Knickanator_ The Utah Jazz traded Donovan Mitchell for draft capital and to tank, but are now choosing to win? https://t.co/mHQz2HeIPK@SorenFree2195 @utahjazz More picks is great!!!@TodayInSportsCo @utahjazz As long as they keep playing as good as they are, I don't care if they wear clown wigs and face paint.

They were terrible vs @Suns.
They didn't challenge @memgrizz.

First Half Points Allowed
Knicks 76
Suns 69
Grizzlies 72

This team can't shoot &amp; they refuse to play defense or rebound.

But I guess trading away two of their best players, one of which even got defensive player of the year that carried you to first seed in the West in 2021 was a blessing in disguise for the Utah Jazz.🤣 https://t.co/zfIw3NaFDB@jazzteamfan @utahjazz I would lose my mind and run through a brick wall@Abdusebur @utahjazz Ima cry bro@jazzteamfan @utahjazz The possibility’s are endless@jazzteamfan @utahjazz I would bring my 90 year old grandma to her first jazz game ever!!@jazzteamfan @utahjazz This https://t.co/2NKUtQGOxD@jazzteamfan @utahjazz Teach my band students how to play roundball rock and perform it at our next concert.

It's their 5th win in a row, putting them at 9-3 alongside other contenders like the Utah Jazz and Portland Trail Blazers. New career-high 6 threes for Al Horford tonight.Temple finally beat Nova lol. Fun fact: I worked out with the Temple mens team as a walk on back in 2016, &amp; even defeated their 6’5 starting shooting guard in a 1v1, who later ended up with the Utah Jazz for a short time.@zachlanebryan all my Utah Jazz homies hate tickets matter https://t.co/nURdl7prp9Again F*%K THE TANK #UTAHJAZZ https://t.co/dINipdfa24@TheNBACentral @JakeLFischer Boston @celtics , Phoenix @Suns and  Utah @utahjazz fans love guys like this! ☝️ 😉Danny Ainge is a genius. #JazzMusic #utahjazz@Danology10 @safemoon Utah Jazz arena will be nice.

#NorthwestDivision #UtahJazz #WesternConference https://t.co/oNH22mILkAIt makes sense bc The Utah Jazz don’t have a legitimate SF on that roster outside of Rudy Gay. I like his upside  but it’s either him or a pick and I am assuming that The Bucks might choose to give up the prospect instead of a future pick but I would take it either way. https://t.co/v273qAMEPMUtah Jazz will ditch Ticketmaster next year

He’s a piece to build around not get rid of.Robert Covington has just announced on his own instagram that he has signed a 4-year extension with Utah Jazz.Please check my math: at current standings, @utahjazz would have the 11th and 12th picks, or a total odds of 3.5% for the first pick, and about 15% for a top 4 pick. No need to trade anybody at all. @DLocke09 @andyblarsen @tribjazz @tribjazzThe Utah Jazz Are SHOCKING THE WORLD

I’ve been trying to figure out how a team that was supposed to tank now has the best record in the West…It took Donovan Mitchell 28 games last season to reach EIGHT 30+ point games last season with the Utah Jazz.

He currently has 8 with the Cavs through just 10 games. How many will he end the season with?Join the tank corps they said #utahjazz https://t.co/2ns4bBSeIP
