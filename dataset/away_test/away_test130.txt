Markkanen (Utah Jazz) under 2.5 three pointers made -137 odds 

He shoots a lot but his % is terrible. 

I think he could make 1-2 three pointers on 4 or 5 attempts

It’s hard to predict how the rest of this season is going to go. Right now the Utah Jazz are either good or very bad, it all depends. I predict a win tonight, but we’ll see.
