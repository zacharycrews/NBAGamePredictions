They opened 9-0 before finally having their perfect record come to an end with a 98-117 loss in Atlanta on Monday.  I always like fading teams the game after having an extended winning streak come to an#NBATwitter #GamblingTwitter #PlayerProps 

Shai Gilgeous-Alexander o27.5pts is fine for me. Averaging 31 on the season, SGA is 6/9 on 30+ point games. A rare off night vs Bucks in Milwaukee (7/16) means the line drops one or two pts, but I think SGA will have another big night!Look at every single professional sports team &amp; where they’re located ..
