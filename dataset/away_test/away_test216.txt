A thread:@CHGO_Sports @CHGO_Bulls @mkhoops The @chicagobulls could easily be 12-2 right now, instead they're 6-8. A lot of the Bulls losses are due to Billy Donovan's lack of in-game adjustments &amp; bad coaching decisions in clutch games. Billy is a HUGE problem. #SeeRed #BullsNation https://t.co/a50omXRGwr@nfl_bigode Seattle Seahawks

Gotta win today@RougeDalts @FenderGuy69 @RGopher69 @DarrellDavisSK @Wpg_BlueBombers Every team Mark listed was a dynasty. Add in the 1990s Dallas Cowboys, the 1990s Chicago Bulls, Lakers of the early 2000s, San Antonio during Duncan's run. They are all dynasties. If Winnipeg wins on Sunday they go into that category as well, no question.@TrueHoop This makes me feel so bad for Jerry Reinsdorf.
