I will take the Sacramento Kings if they go +.
Could be something similar to their game vs Hornets when they were down 15 early game. 

My only concern is there’s a significant money on them tonight, let’s see if they sell out.

#NBATwitterHello all. I've been impressed with the Sacramento Kings offensive scheme this year, Mike Brown's done an excellent job in early offense. Here they open the game with 'Elbow Twirl Chicago' to get Kevin Huerter on the move after a switch. Put your sound on for this one! https://t.co/vWdyqiNFSHSuspect foul calls especially against Domas are a topic for Sacramento Kings fans. Check out all 30 of his fouls in this thread.

De’Aaron Fox is questionable but he has practiced with the team so I see him playing in this one. The Kings are 5-2 ATS this season while the Magic are 3-5-1 ATS.
