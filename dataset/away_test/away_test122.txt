Also, scottie can run PG. But yea we lose some defence for sure.6) To sum up my feelings: The apology felt empty. It came directly after being suspended after a week of deflecting and doubling down on his beliefs. I'm very upset at the NBA and the Brooklyn Nets for letting this take almost a week to resolve the situation.

Y‚Äôall ain‚Äôt on Twitter crying when these players get called slurs every game by racist fans, or when the Nets aggressively gentrify Brooklyn, but a player posts a movie link you outragedY‚Äôall think @KyrieIrving should‚Äôve been suspended? 

#BrooklynNets #NBA #KyrieIrving@NYPost_Lewis If a player said something or promoted something that was disparaging to KD and his race/ethnicity/etc. Im sure he and Kyrie would have a different take. But because it's involves the Jewish religion it's ok. NOT OK!!!

KD and Kyrie are not the problem.
Carry on.Btw if @KyrieIrving ever does play again for the Nets, he needs to address the entire fan base at the next home game. On the mic. Like he did for opening night.

Brooklyn obviously has a huge jewish fanbase and at the bare minimum he needs to be put in that uncomfortable positionNRW YORK: Brooklyn Nets star Kyrie Irving issued an apology for tweeting a link to an antisemitic documentary. It came just hours after team suspended him for 5 games without pay, for initially defending his actions.Why is @KyrieIrving being punished for posting a link but  Amazon not being punished for hosting the link on its platform? 

Also, did @KyrieIrving volunteer to donate $500K to the ADL or was he forced to by @BrooklynNets @NBA ? If it wasn't voluntary, that would mean extortion!VIDEO: Kyrie Irving further fuels controversy ahead of meeting with NBA Commissioner Adam Silver

Let him face some questions about Kyrie and be able to set the tone for how he'll handle the situation and Kyrie going forward.@diggdeeper @NPR As far as Kyrie Irving's actions, I have no problem with the Brooklyn Nets enforcing the morals clause of their contract.

As far as punishment for Kyre Irvin's beliefs, no.@BrooklynNets 
Shame on you for not taking an actual stance against Kyrie Irving‚Äôs blatant antisemitism. When antisemitic attacks are on the rise, &amp; the Jewish community is rife with fear, a firm stance against antisemitism must be taken. We will remember your lack of allyship@DCdaCaptain @OfficialMkRich @Eaglestown @NotATweeter16 @BrooklynNets 14.8 million Jews in the world and roughly 800,000 Holocaust survivors and descendants who were paid $100-$300 a month in reparations.
