We do not own Brooklyn’s unprotected pick: the Rockets own the right to swap their place in the draft with Brooklyn’s place in the draft if Brooklyn’s pick is more favorable.@BrooklynNets @YESNetwork That’s what joe says during the genocide mission💥 Sem Irving, KD e @BrooklynNets derrotam @WashWizards! 🔥

As a Lakers fan, watching KD break ankles &amp; finish the mid range shot was enjoyable to watch.Thinking about @cavs &amp; how they stole Jarett  Allen from the @BrooklynNets Nets are every example of what is wrong with NBA. Young team first top 10 center! Nets hoarded cancerous players like @JHarden13 @BenSimmons25 @KyrieIrving. I would not trade Allen for all 3 straight up.Its sad but it look like Jacque Vaughn is going to coach the Brooklyn nets rest of the season #netsworld #nets @BrooklynNets🚨 New Breakdown Video 🚨

My opinion on all this? Being Pro-Black isn’t a monolith. Being Pro-Black isn’t ignorant. Kyrie is Pro-Kyrie. Period.The owner of the Brooklyn Nets wanted to help Kyrie. Kyrie didn’t answer any of his texts. Kyrie had his agent talk to the owner. The owner accepted the deal to donate money to Anti-Defamation. Anti-Defamation turned it down. The commissioner pushed for a suspension.@joetsai1999 @BrooklynNets @wacchi1013 Where’s my Ime Udoka announcement also sign Yuta to a real deal@overtime @KDTrey5 @BrooklynNets Had to come back to this photo one of the announcers said he was hoopin like he was back in Barry Farms… if your not familiar with Barry Farms then this tweet isnt for you!!!!!……@BinFIoxkins @BrooklynNets Just start over tbh@StopAntisemites @amazon @JeffBezos @amazon_policy @AppleBooks @BrooklynNets @KyrieIrving Thoughts? @PrimeVideo @amazon@joetsai1999 @BrooklynNets @wacchi1013 Why doesn’t he have a guaranteed contract yet, sir?!@dmorales125 @BrooklynNets Nah Steve Nash if kyrie was playing they’d just win by more… hopefully@meechone @chibbs_1 @44TheLegend @BrooklynNets Great call Meech…@BrooklynNets @JetBlue Cam should have always been in.

The suspension is due to a link Kyrie posted on Twitter that implied Anti-Semitic hate speech.

fans know how Kevin Durant is feeling about Ben Simmons these days ..@BrooklynNets Why you showcasing a player that doesn’t even wanna be apart of your organization lolThat’s bullshit @FanDuel I made a parlay yesterday that included @BrooklynNets if I knew @KyrieIrving was gonna get suspended I would have let the Mets off the ticket. You could’ve at least refunded or voided that game. That’s fucked upSumner shouldn't be in the starting lineup #BrooklynNets@AASpark27 @BrooklynNets Your teams ass and poverty https://t.co/v31OQmeyPfIf Kyrie plays another game for @BrooklynNets . We should boycott all home games . This stuff has to stop. @NBA @NBAonTNT #Trending@clampgod__ @MccFred @BrooklynNets @Raptors He thinks like Masai though. Who is the President. #TrustIn MasaiCam Thomas wanted his opportunity. Now he’s got one. Due to Kyrie Irving serving a minimum five-game suspension for what the Nets encapsulated as “conduct detrimental to the team,” there is now a need for backcourt scoring in Brooklyn. @krisplashed

It's not an apology at all, much less a sincere one by any means.Hard to see how the Brooklyn Nets could now hire Ime Udoka, who's under suspension by his team, after they're just made a big point by suspending Kyrie Irving.These Brooklyn Nets jerseys are ugly as hell@TonyBlount @BrooklynNets @NBA @KyrieIrving I'm getting master and servant vibes from this whole situation.@BrooklynNets @TimCapstraw @ChrisCarrino Sharpe is not the reason to he Nets are 2-6.  He needs improvement and maybe he can’t improve but he is the only player you are negative on, implying he’s the problem.

But instead he left it open to interpretation. Should’ve made it clear he didn’t agree with the antisemitism and Holocaust denial the first chance he got.@darwinchvz320 And then the Nets are going to look so ridiculous that Brooklyn might just swallow itself lol@BrooklynNets @BucketsONeale00 Start cam@AlexBerenson @elonmusk @BrooklynNets Lol but no.
