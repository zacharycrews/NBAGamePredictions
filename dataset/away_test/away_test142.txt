After shipping Donovan and Rudy out this offseason, the Utah Jazz are shocking the basketball world with their start, led by Markkanen who is doing it on both ends of the court. 

Moment could be a block from Oct 31 where he set career-high in blocks with 4@utjazzfocus @NetsMuse @celtics @utahjazz @BrooklynNets Yh but ask me as a rockets fan,having a good pick 1yr doesn't make you good.

And i think many other teams would be able to give them much more than you gave them.

I personnaly think Brown is almost as good as D.Mitchel and a better defender but you guys got alot for him.🏀 Los Angeles Lakers (@Lakers) #LakeShow

 @utahjazz you are great team! Keep enjoying the moment, we fans are for sure!

ps. cant wait Jazz games vs @memgrizz https://t.co/frAdcYJOpd@SLAMonline @utahjazz Le-B &amp; Westie realizing at this moment that they’re gonna have to fight like hell just to get into the playoffs. #GoJazz https://t.co/sCeCdPJAdHThe Los Angeles Clippers have the worst offense in the league, with one of the best defenses in the league. Despite having a 5 -  4 record, the Jazz cannot go into this thinking it's going to be easy. It's going to be an interesting game tonight.
#NBA #TakeNote #utahjazzUtah a jazz projected season record! What do you guys think? #utahjazz #takenote #swatlakecity https://t.co/F98YJ7KKSyThe Utah Jazz bench is averaging almost as many points as the starting lineup. Will Hardy can go to pretty much any player on the bench with the confidence that they can play as well as almost any of the star players. That's what makes a good team.
#NBA #TakeNoteUtah Jazz updated Injury report for todays game! https://t.co/JjHWX7TdIb@jason9890 @BigGameBoomer Wym. Have you not heard about the Denver Nuggets &amp; the Utah Jazz how the altitude COMPLETELY changes the complexion of their home court advantages..?? &amp; my bad that OSU a top 2 team in the country can’t run the ball against a 1-7 Northwestern team r u serious..??!!The 2022-2023 NBA Predictions are very interesting to look at when you compare the predictions with how the teams are doing now. The Utah Jazz had a 75% chance of making the playoffs, but only a 2% chance of making the finals, with a pretty even record.

#TakeNote #Team49 https://t.co/vLkBfUugQg@SpencerKeele Seriously, not even as a basketball fan, but the trade of Markkanen was probably one of the worst in NBA history. 

Suits me as an Utah Jazz fan (decade+ ago).@JLEdwardsIII I am sure Utah Jazz has a different opinion on that matter.
But most importantly, we tend to skip the reality check just because we are in a rebuild mode. The team on the court is losing because they are not doing the right things. Not because they lack quality.Are Kawhi Leonard and   Paul George playing tonight vs Utah Jazz? https://t.co/XdGczPYA9Z https://t.co/UM0nJldXscDon’t miss this nationally televised game between @slcstars &amp; @gleagueignite  same time as the Jazz game but that’s the beauty of DVR #utahjazz #slcstars #gleagueignite @ Salt Lake City, Utah https://t.co/bo1FQQv6AD@ArpitBnsl @LAClippers @utahjazz @KTLA @AM570LASports @TuLigaRadio He's out@benawoks lmao will hardy. he coach the utah jazz@slcstars play @gleagueignite today same time as @utahjazz stream on https://t.co/jkZwLaIyDf #utahjazz #slcstars #ignite https://t.co/AzMU0Epgc4@RonJohnsonWI A WISCONSIN US Senate candidate publicizing an endorsement from a former UTAH JAZZ basketball player isn’t the win he thinks it is.@LAClippers @utahjazz @KTLA @AM570LASports @TuLigaRadio Why do I have a feeling John wall is starting today@BenStinar Cool story. 

But Spida either was either not legit or not honorable enough (or maybe not healthy enough) to play defense for the last year or two in Utah.
