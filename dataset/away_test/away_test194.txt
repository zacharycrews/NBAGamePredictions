https://t.co/2szPyaLeIl
 #utahjazz #trailblazersThe Utah Jazz this season have followed the same rule every game. If the Jazz are making their shots, they can stage a blowout over a good, or even great team. On the other hand, if the Jazz are turning the ball over and missing their shots, it doesn't end well.

Currently in his 3rd consecutive season averaging at least 40% for 3-pointers so he doesn't mind playing off the for skip pass 3-pointers sometimes. https://t.co/wDhRP370PG@JoshuaInLangle1 @DanMachholz @pentictonrich @BigNasty6oh4 I agree.  What I saw the Utah Jazz do this off season is the kind of wholesale change I'm thinking of honestly.  I don't know if that's even remotely possible here.  It would take ownership buy in or new ownership IMO.Program Alert! #Sixers fans....

Not sure why the name wasn’t changed when they moved the team to Utah.In my opinion, if Will Hardy can make the right decisions in tonight's game against the 76ers, the Jazz might be able to come away with the win. Either way, the obvious takeaway from last night is that the Jazz are going to have to work for their wins.

Did I win the bid? Also, yes.

I guess anything for charity 😬🤗 @utahjazz@DougNorrie Not if you understand how team basketball works.  Case in point, Russell Westbrook in LA.  Kyrie disrupts the offense masked by individual brilliance and disrupts defense by his lack of effort.  Post-Kyrie, it fits.

-40 point bombs all around the league, but it came from favorites like Luka, Tatum and Embiid

-KD and KP led their teams to wins over Moneyline faves  LA Clippers and Utah Jazz, respectively https://t.co/XtjLaAxhiW@qshironalbertie @xerechrist @utahjazz Exactly. Whether the plan is to boost the value of the vets and manage his injury they should also be using him properly . No reason he should still be playin 20 minutes. He should at least be at 30 by now with more freedom to score@jenn554120301 @xerechrist @utahjazz Definitely. On the one hand, I don’t mind teaching him how to be a better player, a better playmaker. But playing him 15-25 mpg ain’t it. It needs to be 25-35 nightly and 30 minimum after they trade a couple vets79-3 and now 78-4?!
What a terrible turn of events! @utahjazz@qshironalbertie @xerechrist @utahjazz And he’ll be effeicent too. Dude took 9 shots today and had 17 . 13 in the 3rd quarter. They’re holding him back if anythingThe Washington Wizards registered a 3rd successive victory after beating the Utah Jazz 121-112 at Capital One Arena #SSBasketball@BuckleUpBoler @utahjazz Here's hoping for a NEW WINNING STREAK starting tomorrow!@jenn554120301 @xerechrist @utahjazz Facts. Give Sexton 28 shots a game and see what he averages@qshironalbertie @xerechrist @utahjazz Period.talking to me about two games where he took what 9 shots or whatever it is ain’t gonna cut it. Guys throughout that roster is shots and get more touches. They are disarming him by not feeding him@jenn554120301 @xerechrist @utahjazz Bro said he was struggling for 2 games as if (1) that’s a long time (2) we don’t watch other Jazz players .. STARTERS .. do it lol (3) when you have a volume scorer (man had a career avg of 20 PPG before coming to Utah, higher than every1 on his team lmao) ur supposed to feed him@NBA @utahjazz Jazz have been looking great so far in the season@TodayInSportsCo @utahjazz Hate them more and more each gameTwo shocking #NBA facts today. The Wizards beat the number one team in the Western Conference, and that number one team is the Utah Jazz.@CBSSportsNBA Totally believable that a former-player-turned-GM would not try to tank!
The good @utahjazz team that Ainge got was never going to be one of the best in the West.
