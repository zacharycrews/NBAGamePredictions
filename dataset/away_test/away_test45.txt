Orlando Violated The Knicks Season Last Year With Less Talent.

Will a win against the 0-3 Orlando Magic be treated like a great achievement or will it be viewed as taking care of business? https://t.co/2bSIVAjvxm@OrlandoMagic @The_ColeAnthony Can’t fall 0-4 after thissss 🤞🏽@OrlandoMagic @The_ColeAnthony This shi is hard@MagicBamba But I don't see myself in this picture I am one of the biggest @OrlandoMagic Fans Ever@balldontstop Truth! It's a fit problem and the fans and media have destroyed this man. I know he goes home and probably damn near cries and I'm not trying to be funny, I'm dead ass! If I were him, I'd go in and demand a trade. I wouldn't care if it was to the 0-3 Orlando Magic. 🤷🏾‍♂️Another NBA TV doubleheader tonight starting at 7:30!

No. 1 pick Paolo Banchero and the Orlando Magic take on the Knicks at The Garden, followed by reigning MVP Jokić and the Denver Nuggets visiting Dame and the Trail Blazers who look to improve to 4-0

Here are zoomed-in shots, inspired by the numerals on Oregon's football uniforms. https://t.co/0T4nNThnCSPaolo Banchero is already proving why he was the #1 overall pick, having a record-breaking debut for the Orlando Magic to kick off the season.

Don’t stress too much about the early games. Things course correct very quickly.@OrlandoMagic I hope you go to put milk in your cereal this morning but it’s expired and you don’t realize until after you’ve used the last of your remaining cereal.

You want to join us?1.1U - Julius Randle DD

His o9.5 rebs is juiced to -135 but his DD is -110?

Makes no sense but I'll take it, Orlando allowed the most rebs to opposing PFs last season &amp; Randle has recorded a DD in 3/L4 vs the Magic

Low total &amp; likely an ugly game = more rebs
