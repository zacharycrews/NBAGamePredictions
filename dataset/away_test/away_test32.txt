Grrrrrrrrr‚ÄºÔ∏è@HoustonRockets Sengun/Tari should start. Jabari tough two games. Like in college he was hit or miss with his shot. He is a piece and hopefully becomes a great defender and improves his fg%. Props to KPJ, early on making me into a believer. Jalen Green is a star. Great showing #RocketsJa Morant scored 49 points to lead the Memphis Grizzlies to a win against the Houston Rockets.
