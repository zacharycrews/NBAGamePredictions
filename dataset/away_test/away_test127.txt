We need help!  #GoldenStateWarriorsThe Golden State Warriors absolutely suck! Kerr needs to move to ChinaWarriors struggles hit a new low with a 130-129 loss to the Magic.

That’s four straight losses on the road, each against teams with losing records. 

Golden State gives up 77 second-half points and a 16-point lead in an inexcusable defeat.the golden state warriors https://t.co/o2S8reqdUrThis is not my Golden State Warriors please #dubnationWith a win tomorrow, the Los Angeles Lakers will have a better record than the defending Champion Golden State WarriorsWtf is wrong with the warriors? #GoldenStateWarriors #wtf https://t.co/OGsMyr3WYSGolden State Warriors just lost 4 games in a row.

Stay out of Curry, please.The #OrlandoMagic beat the #GoldenStateWarriors????Warriors got their best offence, full guns on the floor  Curry, Poole, Wiggins #Warriors,#GoldenStateWarriors #GSW #ORLvsGSW #MagicvsWarriors #NBAAfter tonight's game, we can say that golden state warriors are in.......Golden State Warriors Basketball.vai tomar no cu golden state warriorsThis was a great way to bounce back from that loss. They had an angry Golden State Warriors team coming in and they not only came back from double digits but they stayed in he game and pulled this out against The Champs. #Magic #MagicTogetherGolden State Warriors start 0-6 on the road losing to the lowly Orlando Magic tonight. You can’t tell me that Draymond “triple single” Green didn’t destroy this team when he sucker punched Jordan Poole.That’s the 2nd game in a row where Klay has taken the shot instead of Steph. YOU HAVE TO GIVE 30 THE BALL! #GoldenStateWarriorsIf the Lakers win on Friday they will have a better record than the Golden State Warriors — who just lost to the last place team in the NBA, the Orlando Magic.

The Magic came back from being down 16 in the 3rd too..Are the golden state warriors experiencing a championship hangover????? A lose to the magic is as bad as it getsJALEN SUGGS OWNS THE

Curry bad pass and Draymond has to foul, so his night is over. 

This will be another frustrating loss for the Golden State Warriors on a terrible road tripGolden State Warriors struggle’s continuesthe Golden State Warriors love the 3 so much, they think that’s how many quarters are in a gameWE FUCKING LOST AGAIN #Warriors #GoldenStateWarriorsThe golden state warriors have the worst defense in the history of professional basketballGOLDEN STATE WARRIORS.Draymond Green &amp; Kevon Looney are starting for the Golden State Warriors to serve as a means to an end

They are not there to shoot

They are there to establish and maintain conditions that are most favorable to them and unfavorable to the opponent...A good example of this is the Golden State Warriors

What people see &amp; comprehend is a lot of shooting and they see the Warriors win

But because they only see and think tactically, they misunderstand the Warriors and fail when they attempt to replicate it...A win for #GoldenStateWarriors is what I hate see… Come on #OrlandoMagic #nbaThe Orlando Magic have taken THIRTY more free throws than the golden state warriors. THREE ZERO. The Warriors defensive identity is nonexistent.The announcers have been dickriding the #Warriors all night

Complete boycott. Don't go to their games. Don't buy any merch. Do not even mention their name until they pull their fingers out of their asses and start playing basketball the way you're supposed to. Absolute grubs.One thing about Steve Kerr he's going to stick up for his team when the referees play games. I love to see it. He gets so red and frustrated, but as a player, I know it must feel good to see your coach sticking up for you. #GoldenStateWarriorsLmaoo! Golden state warriors sucks 😂😂😂.Golden state warriors is not a serious team Allah.What’s up with Golden State Warriors??👀👀

By Orlando? Golden State, we may have a problem here… #NBATwitter #NBAwonkThe Golden State Warriors are the biggest fuckwits on planet Earth.

How do the champs spend millions in luxury tax but have such bad commentary?Until we fix this shit up, the Golden State Warriors will not win the championship.

And the dynasty run could be over.The warriors bench is frightening bad. Too much herky-jerky and too little substance (Wiseman, here’s looking at you!). 

Serious questions need to be asked if they lose this.
