Thank you to the Phoenix Suns for honoring the 22 tribal Nations of Arizona. 

This is how you honor Native peoples the right way! Collaboration and discussions with each of the tribes. https://t.co/fuw5meUIyGPhoenix: the Suns consistently do City jerseys better than anyone.  Multiple nods to native groups in Arizona and, as someone on a western wear kick, the pattern down the side is 🔥 9.5/10 https://t.co/gu1nmPmNkYThis is what the Phoenix Suns do to a team's culture and vibes https://t.co/emchHk5uWJI see a lot of people bashing the new @suns Jersey’s &amp; it’s really sad that they fail to see what they represent!
