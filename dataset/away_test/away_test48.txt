#AtlanticDivision #Basketball #BrooklynNets #EasternConference #KevinDurant #KyrieIrving https://t.co/fubZJXoBHf@will_nets @BrooklynNets teams will always want more 3 pt shooting

he might be more valuable overall but the Nets just need a big who can shoot 3s and rebound and actually guard real centers

unless Clax makes a big leap this year (not out of the question but unlikely), they need to get a beefy 5October 23, 2019 All Star point guard Kyrie Irving pours in 50 points, setting a new NBA record for points on debut with a new team as his Brooklyn Nets go down 127-126 at home to the Minnesota Timberwolves #OnThisDate #PR https://t.co/AnnqHsLe35@rotellular @BrooklynNets They have no reason to want Joe and he is more valuable than ollynyk alone@Rip2xDrageee @alex93899882 @BrooklynNets @BestTrailsNY @BucketsONeale00 @BenSimmons25 Yeah that’s fair@FearDeuce He's a Brooklyn Net sadly@will_nets @BrooklynNets true

they already have an ungodly amount of draft capital and this run will bound to lose steam eventually/management will intervene 

though they might like some more shooting

i would consider giving up Joe and pick(s) for Olynyk, but even then maybe that's not enough@TomCrean @TheAthletic @Alex__Schiffer @BrooklynNets @_claxton33 The guy had six points that's a bounce back man the bar has loweredThe crew was back to reflect on the #Grizzlies “Texas two step” and look forward to tomorrow night’s matchup against the Brooklyn Nets at @FedExForum. #TurnUsUp ⬇️🔊 https://t.co/w5M74dO6kg@rotellular @BrooklynNets Don’t see what nets have that Danny ainge would want.

#GamblingTwitter@DBIMGMTGROUPLLC @TheyCallMeBBC @ROCcitizen1 @BerettaEarl @knicks @BrooklynNets @KimPegula @NBA Rochester is the second largest economy in the entire state! People would come from Syracuse Ottawa Montreal New York City!@alex93899882 @BrooklynNets @BestTrailsNY @BucketsONeale00 @BenSimmons25 They winning both@TheyCallMeBBC @ROCcitizen1 @DBIMGMTGROUPLLC @knicks @BrooklynNets @KimPegula Syracuse has a smaller population as well@TheyCallMeBBC @ROCcitizen1 @DBIMGMTGROUPLLC @knicks @BrooklynNets @KimPegula I'm sure we all agree with this,  I feel confident in that statement but again if buffaHOLE can do it being a similar population we could too. It's damn near a mirror image!
Buffalo is only bigger in popularity because of the Bills

Not saying that's an invest we should consider@ROCcitizen1 @DBIMGMTGROUPLLC @BerettaEarl @knicks @BrooklynNets @KimPegula I would rather have a really good mid level team and see good players move up the ranks, then a really shitty national team. If a person goes to Chicago, there is a shit ton more to do there then just watch a sports team@ROCcitizen1 @DBIMGMTGROUPLLC @BerettaEarl @knicks @BrooklynNets @KimPegula Build back the city’s tarnished image, Start bringing back the unique mom and pop shops so we can start getting in on the hospitality and tourism areas outside of the area bring in like wine country, Niagara Falls, a lot of the festivals and outdoorsy stuff the area offers.@DBIMGMTGROUPLLC @knicks @BrooklynNets @KimPegula Rochester doesn't have a big enough venue for major league sports...but nice thought...look at the little stadium on oak st...was supposed to be for major league soccer....barely big enough for H.S. football!Utah tho! came in a +7.5 &amp; up 10 with 2 left in the third @ New Orleans, who bullied the Nets in Brooklyn 😳@cavs have the best bench reaction, like @BrooklynNets before Durant.@sal_licata Is it possible he meant the Nets have never made the finals while being the Brooklyn Nets ?? Otherwise this makes no sense@ROCcitizen1 @DBIMGMTGROUPLLC @BerettaEarl @knicks @BrooklynNets @KimPegula It’s like the rumors going around to make RIT a I think Division 1 team school. Good to have a dream, but we are too small.  We have to first fix the moral of the public who live here, rebuild trust in the system and politicians who run it, thenGreat article here from GW alum and current Brooklyn Net Yuta Watanabe https://t.co/Qh7p9IsWpU@DBIMGMTGROUPLLC @TheyCallMeBBC @BerettaEarl @knicks @BrooklynNets @KimPegula @NBA Stop thinking any pro team will play here. Rochester is a very small city with no money. Imagine thinking a Toronto team would come here hahahaha seriously though, Rochester is a small city@ROCcitizen1 @DBIMGMTGROUPLLC @knicks @BrooklynNets @KimPegula I mean buffalo ain't much better...
