Having just watched the Detroit Pistons for a half changed my perspective on what hell is.

Don’t know that it can get much worse for the Pistons defensively.Robin “My eyes are telling me +18.5 Detroit Pistons!”

Knicks played a near-flawless first half with at least 10 three-pointers. Ball movement was electric and fluid. #NewYorkForever @nyknicks #Knicks #NYK@Avignon85 @RaznHaol @DetroitPistons @44Bojan @SaddiqBey Hopefully getting embarassed will increase effort on DYou said WHAT? #DetroitStandUp @DetroitPistons #Pistons https://t.co/V13JFGAooh@DetroitPistons @SaddiqBey Scoreboard@RaznHaol @DetroitPistons @44Bojan @SaddiqBey Lazy defense@DetroitPistons free throws 😪😪@DetroitPistons @SaddiqBey There was a game tonight?@DetroitPistons @SaddiqBey We suckGiving up 72 points to the knicks in the first half 🤦🏽‍♂️🥴😩 #Pistons #DetroitPistons@nyknicks #homeopener is a #fatherson vibe for real. 

We are killing @detroitpistons in the first half. @ Madison Square Garden https://t.co/GMzLMawuBnThe Detroit Pistons are currently shooting 23% from the line. In case you’re wondering - the record for lowest FT percentage in a game belongs to the Toronto Raptors from 1996.The @DetroitPistons can't even buy a FT. And they are FREE!Every player on the Detroit Pistons are REQUIRED to make 100 CONSECUTIVE FREE THROWS in their next practice! 

I dont expect 100% in games. But starting 1-11 in FTs is UNACCEPTABLE@DetroitPistons @44Bojan @SaddiqBey We need that D@nyknicks #homeopener #fatherson night out vs the @detroitpistons and we are killing them. #letsgoknicks @ Madison Square Garden https://t.co/rhaR1slRor@DetroitPistons @44Bojan @SaddiqBey Pick up 🆙 that D Fellas@DetroitPodcast Their matadors defense you mean #DetroitPistons https://t.co/LQNjwHAixlThe New York Knicks age, experience, size, and number of vets is just too much for our young Detroit Pistons.
