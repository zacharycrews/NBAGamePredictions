   https://t.co/OeiT1mNzat@OrlandoMagic @dallasmavs @BallySportsFL @BallyMagic @969thegame Go get win number 2, Magic!@LukaUpdates @OrlandoMagic I am not wasting another night. Also, see you at midnight 😂@OrlandoMagic @dallasmavs @BallySportsFL @BallyMagic @969thegame Hoping y’all prove me wrong this season, but I’m hopping back on the train #Gomagic@Stephen0610 It opened up even higher actually, which means money is coming in on the Magic. I see it as a trap, Orlando has no healthy guards and struggles to put up points on the road. Mavericks win by 20+ IMO. This is why gambling is dangerous, the odds makers know what they are doing…Cleveland Cavaliers, Orlando Magic, New Orleans Pelicans and Detroit Pistons be those watchable games@dallasmavs @AACenter @OrlandoMagic @UTSWNews Hopefully they figure out how to rebound, protect the paint, and close out games, because that was not the Warriors they were playing last night, and that was painful to watch. Maybe McGee should have played LAST night and rested tonight 🙄is anybody paying attention to the @OrlandoMagic great underdog bets🤌🏾@OrlandoMagic @Pp_doesit Bad picture since he’s literally carrying the ball!If we can’t rebound we might be the worst team in the South East Division! Yes I said it even worst than @hornets and @OrlandoMagic . #HEATCulture #HeatTwitter@OrlandoMagic @MattyWorldPeace @PapaJohns Amazing 😂👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻Let’s make it back to back wins tonight in Dallas.

Tonight, they beat the defending NBA champs on the second night of a back-to-back without their starting backcourt and their sixth man from a year ago.

Make it make sense but hey, I'm just gonna enjoy this win.@_R_M_M @lukesm51 @KOT4Q Oh I remember . I’m a basketball junkie lol. I pay attention to coaching 😂.

If you don't like that, you don't like Charlotte Hornets basketball.@Jones_Stats They even forced overtime like I don't understand what I've just witnessed.
See team weh dey struggle to get buckets against Orlando magic beating golden states and getting clutch buckets.

Can't win a game when y'all just decided to play good basketball at the end. Embarrasing loss. Y'all just lost to a Hornets team that was just demolished by Orlando Magic the other night. Defending champs my ass.I mean this team just lost to the fuckin Orlando magic by 20. Unacceptable loss.Can't really understand how golden state have just jinxed it against a team that got blown out by Orlando magic less than 48 hrs ago.
This hornets team don't even have any first team point guard on their current roaster and they've just capitalized on the foolishness of warriorsSo…let me get this straight. Last night we got our asses handed to us by the previously winless Orlando Magic and tonight we defeated the defending champion Golden State Warriors?!
