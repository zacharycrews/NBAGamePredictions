Jaden, Cade, Victor, Isaiah, Jalen can be tough if their bigs can be mobile and play tough defensively.

With a bench of Killian, Saddiq and Bagley…

That’s a new Boston…I love the @DetroitPistons franchise since Chauncey and his era. I need Isaiah Stewart to lean out and increase his lateral quickness, so that he could play PF defensively like Jaren Jackson Jr., doubling his value or else he’ll be stuck as an undersized 5 like Wendell Carter Jr. https://t.co/pcdg7ajLzjBen Simmons, box score, double-double, Brooklyn Nets, Kevin Durant, full results, Portland Trail Blazers, latest, updates #America #BenSimmons #boxscore #Brooklyn #BrooklynNets #BrooklynNetsv #Chinesesuperstar #Clippersv #DetroitPistons #epicwinner #FoxBasketball https://t.co/EovhcpmlpSDetroit Pistons vs LA Clippers Nov 17, 2022 Full Game Replay NBA Season

https://t.co/KTY6CLxKjk@DetroitPistons @44Bojan @IveyJaden @SaddiqBey @JalenDuren Didn’t really get or force the TO’s as the 1st half, offense was a struggle, a lot of forced shots that didn’t let things develop-thought the 3’s falling before half was a good sign but meh, solid loss, stayed in it and didn’t get blown out.

#LosAngelesClippers #DetroitPistons #Nba https://t.co/IBd7OCfLFVNot a bad return for Kawhi with 6 pts, 5 Rebs, and 4 asts. It’s been an odd game for @LAClippers and @DetroitPistons. Low scoring and #ClipperNation trailed for most of it but it appears they’re going to pull this one outGoing down to the wire in L.A.

3:12 on the clock, @DetroitPistons 81-87 @LAClippers 

#NBATwitterLIVEI hate this team so fucking much. #DetroitPistonsThe @NBA is clearly not a meritocracy cause that Coach in @DetroitPistons is tripping too. What’s wrong with everyone and analytics?! And regulating player minutes! If someone is working, they stay out till they actually need rest! Y’all tryna lose these games or something?A great defensive game between the #LosAngelesClippers and the #DetroitPistons
Both teams limited each other to less than 42% from the field and less than 40% from three, in this low-scoring game tonight. 
#NBA #NBATwitter #basketball #sportsI'm curious... what improvements did the Detroit Pistons make??? Cause they got Bojan Bogdanovic a much needed Sharpshooter and They Got Alec Burks for bench shot creation yet they're about to be in the bottom of the East for the second straight year@DetroitPistons are hot trash 🗑️ #nba @NBA2:07 PM ETKawhi Leonard will return and start against the Detroit Pistons on Thursday night, coach Ty Lue said.Leonard was previously listed as out, but his status was upgraded to questionable at the LA Clippers' Thursday morning shootaround.After
