The roster is littered with examples.@Heats_ter @MiamiHEAT @Major_Passons @HeatNationCom No other choice is safe bet. But….Spo is a firm…

“Take advantage of your opportunities &amp; make me play you” type guy

Well. His threat, presence, &amp; intrigue alone…the impact it seemed to have on Heat’s pace &amp; space…might be enough to do that.

Typically how it goes with Spo.@profitxai

https://t.co/IKAbNvbgqz@Fantasy_Mansion I have watched most of Miami's games. Tua puts way to much heat on his rb passes earlier in the year. He has gotten better but throwing hard and high is not good throws to rbs. Edmund's is also looking downfield too early.Had to pick up Miami Heat Shaq.

https://t.co/xe4n5P283b@Alexancooper Yeah, most of the first half, @trailblazers were bothering Miami and looking respectable on both ends.  Second half, the Heat were really upping the defensive pressure and scorching the net.  Got our first loss out of the way.  Time to start another winning streak!@MiamiHEAT Now play the song 🥹@NBA @Klow7 @MiamiHEAT he played great basketball tonight you love to see itDamian Lillard exited the game against the Miami Heat with a right calf strain and was ruled out for the contest, the Trail Blazers announced.

The injury appeared to occur midway through the third quarter when he landed after making a 3-pointer.
https://t.co/xYIjllsdzL@MiamiHEAT The problem that is holding this team back is Herro, I really don't understand why he keeps getting PT when he hasn't shown anything worthy to be an NBA player his struggles since coming to the NBA is unreal but his fans wanna ignore it. I have nothing against him, it's just sad https://t.co/IuA0ez1vdv@MiamiHEAT Watch your head 🫡🔥16 throws it down !@MiamiHEAT This is what #HEATCulture  is about!

Caleb Martin was the MVP of this game, this is the Lowry we need, Jimmy is him, Herro heated up at the right moment, Strus is 6MOY and Jovic needs to replace Dedmon permanently.

Carry this momentum for tomorrow.Final Score: #Heat 119 #Blazers 98 Just not a good game for Portland and Lillard got hurt. Just ugh. Not upset though. Miami did what they had to do and Portland just never really played with any fire tonight. 4-1. #RipCity@MiamiHEAT See y’all tomorrow at Chase Center@MiamiHEAT PLAY THE SONG ADMINThe best feeling in the world is a @MiamiHEAT win!!!
#HEATGrit@MiamiHEAT LETS GO BEST TEAM IN THE LEAGUE WHEN DEDMON DOESNT PLAY !@MiamiHEAT The universe wins when Dedmon doesnt play.Final Thoughts: After a tough loss from two nights ago, Miami bounced back in a big way, giving Portland its first loss of the season. The Heat utilized their defense to propel their offense, especially in the 2nd half, where they maintained a sizable lead over the Blazers.@MiamiHEAT Putting him in the Rotation starts NOW !! https://t.co/KUBerHHeHv@MiamiHEAT 2 wins!@RomeyDaHomie_ @MiamiHEAT Listen I was stressed! I was one game away from promising the basketball Gods that I wouldn't laugh at the Lakers anymore if we could just get right lol@MiamiHEAT Thank You.@MiamiHEAT That's the Heat we know is capable 🔥🔥.

But if Miami was looking for a pick-me-up performance this season, they finally got it.After the Blazers home loss against the Miami Heat, the Milwaukee Bucks (3-0) are the only undefeated team in the NBA right now. #FearTheDeerThe first win of the season was an incredible game. @FCHWPO @jaytatum0 picked up where they were against the Miami Heat last year. https://t.co/Pv7BPo0SPi@NBA @Klow7 @MiamiHEAT Can you follow meIt’s Theeeeeee Showstopper!!!

Miami Heat ML -104

A little extra on the Miami Heat tonight. Simons already has 2 fouls. Look for some regression. Lillard gets contained &amp; the Heat can make their move.

Smash the moneylineExcited for Heat @ Blazers. Portland has tons of action they run on offense Miami can counter with switching. But the Heat have defensive targets for the Blazers to attack when they begin sets, not to mention smaller dudes. Portland uses a lot of zone - just like Spo.Hey notis I willing be liking ur tweets for the next 2 hours because the Miami Heat play ball now and sorry for spamming your phone but it will happen@DntBtmbkl @TheNBACentral Not to mention Miami is a free agency destination. I’m more impressed with small market teams consistently in the playoffs like the raps, bucks, nuggets, previously jazz, than I am the heat. You can put heat in front of those who didn’t make a finals run, but Bucks &amp; raps did@MiamiHEAT I'm gonna say this again, they need another big man other than Bam. put Bam on 4, he's an undersized 5.@sportsfanatic39 @MiamiHEAT He tried, Phoenix rejected Duncan for Crowder@MiamiHEAT Let's DO this 👍lakers chicago bulls pacers miami heat and that’s it https://t.co/vXbOgNevh3NBA GAMETHREAD: Miami HEAT (1-3) @ Portland Trail Blazers (4-0) https://t.co/SqG7m3SFqmM is for Milk and M is for Miami. 🥛🐄
