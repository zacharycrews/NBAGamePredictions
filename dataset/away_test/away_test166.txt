https://t.co/CtS4cbmIOAPhoenix suns Gerald green used to go crazy I can’t lie and I done seen dat nigga Marcus get off wit Mo Bamba no cap 😂😂😂😂 https://t.co/VlnxEIVA1kIn this episode, we look at Cam Johnson's torn meniscus and what it means for the Phoenix Suns, the potential for an Anthony Davis trade and if Steve Clifford is long for the Charlotte Hornets. We wrap up with a discussion about the Golden State Warriors.

https://t.co/b6MA9TAHfBWith Johnson not missing as much time as originally expected, I don’t think Phoenix will be desperate for a wing. 

Plus Barnes’ trade value is probably negative right now, whereas the Suns want an asset for Crowder. https://t.co/70hlnUZSUg@Suns Since Jae Crowder has a soft ego &amp; don't give a damn about playing in Phoenix (even though you guys are still paying him), why not go out and get Kemba Walker?  Guy still has a lot left in the tank.  He's looking to contribute to a winning team.  Seems like a good fit.*Free Your Mind
