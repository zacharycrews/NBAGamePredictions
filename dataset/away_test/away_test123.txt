He had played a listless game on Tuesday in a loss to the Chicago Bulls, leaving his teammates and opponents to privately describe him as disengaged and seemingly ‘in another world.’”@OMcconnor @kirkgoldsberry @Suns @cavs @Bucks @Raptors @dallasmavs @Lakers @BrooklynNets @PelicansNBA @chicagobulls @celtics Yeah it hasn't been pretty that's for sure but it seems to be working in the sense that the defense is offense and the rebounding creates a lot of second chances. And Pascal had been an offense unto himself. Other than that, though, it's a bit of a toss up.Bob love is 6'8 ish I believe, the Chicago bulls have the option to go 7'1 Bill &amp; 6'11 Noah 6'10 Tony in the front Court and that is phenomenal I know what the f*** I'm doing... Just think they didn't even want him on the team, but let me be your GM and I will get you there https://t.co/SavlDIRle2@chicagobulls He is great at circus feats!
