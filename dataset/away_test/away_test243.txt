Being Miami, if you have cap space and a hoard of picks, you're in play for ANYBODY

This is a move to center around Herro and Adebayo and be positioned to trade for the next mega-star who demands a trade

Tax savings and Sexton/Beasley are a bonusJazz need to pounce on the perfect situation, and that's the Miami Heat and Jimmy Butler!

At 7-9 with a road B2B against CLE and MIN, the Heat are staring in the face of disappointing season.

They only care about LOSING. 

This is why they LOSE. 

It‚Äôs why their organization is known for being LOSERS.  

Around the NBA, that‚Äôs what they think. Pat Riley is a LOSER. 

The Miami Heat are LOSERS. 

Stupid mentality. https://t.co/2VPDP0oesC@TheNBACentral Miami Heat is missing all those ZEROS...right??@RamosYankor @TwoWayDav @Zakaria39861219 @MiamiHEAT It‚Äôs only been 3 years since they won, like the cavs havnt won since 2016WinCraft NBA Miami Heat Lanyard with Detachable Buckle, 3/4" EPID8DR
