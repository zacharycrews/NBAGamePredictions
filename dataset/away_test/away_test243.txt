How about when Gabe comes back and Kyle needs to take some days off &amp; thus Gabe starts, just continue to bring Kyle off the bench when that starting lineup (Gabe, Herro, Jimmy, Niki, Bam) gets wins. A bench of Kyle-Max-Caleb-Orob/Mechanic would be great.00:00 NBA: Golden State Warriors @ Houston Rockets

They only care about LOSING. 

This is why they LOSE. 

It’s why their organization is known for being LOSERS.  

Around the NBA, that’s what they think. Pat Riley is a LOSER. 

The Miami Heat are LOSERS. 

Stupid mentality. https://t.co/2VPDP0oesC@TheNBACentral Miami Heat is missing all those ZEROS...right??@RamosYankor @TwoWayDav @Zakaria39861219 @MiamiHEAT It’s only been 3 years since they won, like the cavs havnt won since 2016WinCraft NBA Miami Heat Lanyard with Detachable Buckle, 3/4" EPID8DR

Adebayo upgraded to questionable. Also questionable: Dedmon, Vincent. Duncan Robinson is listed as doubtful. Yurtseven, Oladipo is also out.@PsychoMobXRP @JohnEDeaton1 @Ripple @MiamiHEAT I don't think that would be the main thing they'll do, it just sounds cool cause i support both Ripple and the Miami Heat.😅@JohnEDeaton1 @Ripple @MiamiHEAT What do you think @bgarlinghouse?@iamtzamac @JohnEDeaton1 @Ripple @MiamiHEAT I'd be worried if that was Ripple's move. Unnecessarily expensive advertising instead of funding development &amp; growth of the actual products/ecosystem@JohnEDeaton1 @Ripple IDK, but just like the sound of "Ripple Arena" for the @MiamiHeat. 🔥The problem with these takes is that, outside of Miami, I think the impression around the league is the best trade package the Heat can cobble together can't fetch more, in return, than say, Matthew Dellavedova and spare parts. https://t.co/LC8LuU0PJE@notsocooljules It’s cold in Cleveland because Miami didn’t bring the heat!Final: #Timberwolves 112 #76ers 109

Next Game: Miami Heat, Monday, 7:00 p.m. CTHeat without at least five players for Sunday's game against the Cavs, as Jimmy Butler returns to Miami. Here's the latest Heat injury report https://t.co/uEbwfwZrtrIt’s amazing the lack of pressure the fanbase is putting on this offensive staff compared to the heat Richt and Enos got their time at Miami coaching the offense.@hockeywildernes I still have no idea what crypto is, and unless the Miami Heat's arena name gets changed back to American Airlines Arena (AAA), I don't care.@SFSkyforce @bouyea_ycl @MiamiHEAT sign him.

Jimmy Butler is also rumored to be out for this Miami road trip.

Cavs can definitely win tomorrow and be 2-0 for this four game home stand. https://t.co/l4rRhRuLfxIt appears Scottie Barnes injured his left ankle.
