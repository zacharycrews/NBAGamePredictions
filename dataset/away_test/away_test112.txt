https://t.co/nL5JfDWI6MDetroit Pistons has offered several different packages in an attempt to trade for Jaren Jackson, Jr.. At this time, the trade is not imminent.@DowntownDeuce @Mighty_Jt_6 @CadeCunningham_ @DetroitPistons @AshtonDaTrainer all good players, who cares@DowntownDeuce @Mighty_Jt_6 @CadeCunningham_ @DetroitPistons @AshtonDaTrainer When your team is under 500.. Don't post this kind of mess.. Makes the rest of the team look kinda bad@Dindas34334461 @DowntownDeuce @Mighty_Jt_6 @CadeCunningham_ @DetroitPistons @AshtonDaTrainer Cade has a higher PER than Mobley and Green - slightly lower than Scottie.  All of Cade's advanced numbers are up and he's producing a lot more on the court.  Not sure what we want to discuss here.  I'll give you last year - all three had similar numbers but Cade less efficient.@DetroitPistons I think they get it done tonight@DowntownDeuce @Mighty_Jt_6 @CadeCunningham_ @DetroitPistons @AshtonDaTrainer @stephenasmith Still think Green is better than Cade? 🤣@boi_sexci @MalcolmJackso20 @lopezbob4 @DannyRuiz75 @dane_dlsu @BleacherReport @DetroitPistons Tell that too jordan who had a significant drop off in scoring total and efficiency after his return at the ages of 31-32-33 he never eclipsed 30+ points a game or shot over 50% again in his career not to mention his rebound assists and defensive stats all dropping as well.@DetroitPistons had a legit chance to beat the @Bucks last game f Cade would've chosen to be a playmaker hunting for Bogdanovic getting him open looks instead of playing hero ball missing several tough clutch off the dribble contested shots. He's a playmaker not a PG.@DetroitPistons So uh whats the word on the teal watchThere was a lot of debate around who has the best rebuilding core &amp; it's become clear very early:

(4-3) Oklahoma City Thunder
(2-6) Detroit Pistons
(1-7) Orlando Magic
(1-7) Houston Rockets

OKC need a big man (Chet!)
DET need a new coach
ORL need real guards
HOU need EVERYTHING@carlcollinsprod @DowntownDeuce @Mighty_Jt_6 @CadeCunningham_ @DetroitPistons @AshtonDaTrainer Careful - that Scottie defense force comes in quick.It’s the 306th day and a win would make the Detroit Pistons (+450) 3-6. 

1+1/+2/+2+0+2+2 = 10 = 1
It’s a 1 date and it would be the Bucks first loss of the season.

There’s 59 days left in the year. Royce the 5’9” said it’s a BOOM.
