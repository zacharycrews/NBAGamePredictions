Have a fantastic time guys &amp; safe travels. Not jealous at all 🤥 please bring home some wins!!@itsAntWright @Pacers @OrlandoMagic @DetroitPistons @SacramentoKings Sorry, but Banchero is number 1. He get teams beat defenders and is constantly doubled teamed. He also plays against the first unit, not off the bench. This isn’t discounting Mathurin but Banchero is better.The Orlando Magic have been so bad this season that they're being demoted to Rec League status.@jxremmy @itsAntWright @Pacers @OrlandoMagic @DetroitPistons @SacramentoKings He’s gonna have to at least START for me to semiagree that he’s the best rookie lol@bracie_godsey @BigADogReid @MagicEvxn @itsAntWright @Pacers @OrlandoMagic @DetroitPistons @SacramentoKings Can’t even get the start over nesmith and y’all want us to put him over PAOLO?!?? Lmfao@mikeyclark87 @bec_clark89 @MCO @OrlandoMagic @OrlandoMagicUK Safe travels bro!@mikeyclark87 @bec_clark89 @MCO @OrlandoMagic @OrlandoMagicUK Enjoy the trip 😀👍🏻@itsAntWright @Pacers @OrlandoMagic @DetroitPistons @SacramentoKings For now Ben leads but let’s see how teams adjust to his play style.

Do you know how long it took me to learn how to spell Wembanyama? We have to get him if we get the #1 pick. History could repeat itself. We won the lottery in back to back years in 92-93, why not in 22-23?It's a WHOLE MOVEMENT on November 11, 2022
