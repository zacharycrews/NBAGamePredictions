https://t.co/buz7pH7RfOPHOENIX @ PHILLY 
Winner: Suns ☀️ 

Dogfight/ 3PT shootout type of game. Philly ranks 2nd in the league in 3PT efficiency, but with Harden out and Embiid a game time decision, inside out ball will be tough to execute. Booker drops 35 😮‍💨5. The Utah Jazz are clutch. Clutch is not to be underestimated. Clutch took the '21 Phoenix Suns to the NBA Finals. Maybe the Jazz are the '21 Suns.
