Certainly sounds like a serious possibility.  @politicshour @wcpSixers are back at the Wells Fargo Center tonight with another matchup against the Washington Wizards. Great for the squad to be back home after a successful four-game road trip that saw them win each of their final three games. #sixers #wizards https://t.co/Fof3GJ3Rv3Sports while i'm asleep

I like the spot for the Washington Wizards tonight.  They will be out for revenge from a 111-118 home loss to the Philadelphia 76ers on Monday.  Now they get to face the 76ers just two days later in Philadelphia here Wednesday night.I am happy to announce that I am leading a group of investors* to purchase the Washington Wizards from @TedLeonsis to fund his efforts to purchase the Washington Nationals or that shitty football team.
