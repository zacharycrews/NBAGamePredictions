This is the standard Adam Silver set in 2014 for this kind of reaction when he banned Donald Sterling from the NBA and forced him to sell the Clippers, also fining him $2.5 million, the NBA maximum. To not hold him to this same standard now is hypocritical.@_r3lla_3f1 @Section80Rhys @RevanS2022 @ajassy @ADL @BrooklynNets @KyrieIrving Are the Christian and Judaic 'codes' compatible?

https://t.co/3SLRID8xnQ@scottWo87303544 @BrooklynNets Agreed. The precedent is there, set in 2014 with Adam Silver's action against Donald Sterling's racial comments to his girlfriend, for this to be the clear action moving forward. I don't know why the hesitation.Injury Report: Brooklyn Nets vs. Charlotte Hornets https://t.co/g6YZb628CWThe last thing Kyrie Irving will be remembered for — is being dropped by the Brooklyn Nets, cause he hates Jews — created an Antisemitic storm attacking Jewish people across America. This is not “retirement”, this is the biggest loser basketball has ever seen. @KyrieIrving 🤡 https://t.co/QfLJ4fHPJ5@DutchessD_ I don’t have an issue with accountability.

Shit is ridiculous@dogedubowwow @BrooklynNets I mean there is a behavioral code, much like in any job, that everyone in the NBA, regardless of position, are contractually agreed to follow. And Kyrie broke it. Teams have their own that adds to the list from the league. So yeah, not just the Nets, but those on the other 29 too@CallMeChukklz @BrooklynNets Same.

Kyrie should be banned from the NBA entirely. You know, like Adam Silver has created a precedent for this kind of behavior with former Clippers owner Donald Sterling in 2014.@sheckels_ryan @rforan23 @BrooklynNets That is LITERALLY what he did, to three of his bosses: The CEO and CFO of the Nets...and the commissioner of the league on which he plays. The commissioner that has previously banned someone from any involvement with the NBA in the past for hate speech.@sheckels_ryan @rforan23 @BrooklynNets Free speech means the freedom to say what you wish. It does NOT mean that you avoid the consequences of it. I can't go into work tomorrow calling my boss every slur in the book without being asked to leave without my job, can I?

Do you think the Brooklyn Nets are just magically always in controversy or is the franchise just terrible at keeping their house in order.

Other teams probably had terrible controversies that were covered upWas those same “influential people” telling the @BrooklynNets not to let @joetsai1999 purchase the team!? https://t.co/BvHJJOnPEX@nicolasclaxton has been playing really well.

I’ve always had a weakness for basketball players. @BrooklynNets #NetsWorld #nba@7NewsDC @WashWizards @BrooklynNets WTF is he talking about? He didnt even see the film or see what Kyrie said (WHICH WAS NOTHING).  There is nothing Anti Semitic in that film, unless acknowledging the Black African Heritage of Jesus and the Ancient Hebrew is Anti Semitic to you. You may be Anti Black As well.Wed
