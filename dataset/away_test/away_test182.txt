Lebron and Anthony Davis were acquired by that front office. Won a title. Rockets getting zip for Harden.

Sacramento (4-6) will hope to secure its fifth win over the past seven games.

Los Angeles (2-9) would slide into last place in the Western Conference with a loss on Friday. https://t.co/kTBuI9MOTTBased on additional reporting from Woj, it is unlikely Kyrie Irving will join the team during its current West Coast road trip, and unlikely he will play against the Kings on Tuesday in Sacramento. https://t.co/S8xtzQIMxD@JulieanneGilch1 Sacramento kings &amp; OKC been tanking for years no playoffs 😂😂😂 Brunson &amp; Randle can both put up star performances &amp; we’re missing the player that Donovan is.. which we had the chance to get..Sacramento Kings 

Kings are one team that I just have never loved their jerseys but these are pretty sweet. 

Super clean look and the purple really pops on these.

In those 4 wins the kings are averaging over 120 points a game and shooting 40% from three on 39 attempts. 

“Soft part of the schedule” begins tonight🥴Our pick for the @SacramentoKings vs. @Lakers are:

Kings will winAs someone whose biggest heartbreak was the 2002 Sacramento Kings playoff loss, it’s validating to see mainstream media talking about how their games are officiated.

I feel like while we’re at it we should also have some frank conversation regarding the Bush Administration.With the #23 pick of the MBA Redraft, the Sacramento Kings select Zeke NnajiNovember 11, 1996: Seattle's Shawn Kemp scored 31 PTS (13-16 FG) and Gary Payton added 21 PTS &amp; 9 AST in the SuperSonics' 110-94 win over Sacramento.

Mitch Richmond scored 28 PTS and Michael Smith added 15 PTS &amp; 17 REB for the Kings.

#NBAPicks #NBA    #NBA2K23It always amazes me how national folks fail to understand the connection the Kings have with Sacramento and the fans. The city’s only professional team threatened to leave for 6+ years, then stayed. Let the team and fans celebrate that. A lot of bad takes in this post. https://t.co/1EvIU6ek9yHere’s a detailed explanation:

Look up the NBA, look at the teams, look at the conferences, look at the divisions, look at the pacific division, and then you’ll see the Sacramento Kings. You know who you won’t see? The Seattle Supersonics. 

That’s what Kings fans helped do. https://t.co/xNcYmG1z8ASacramento Kings vs. Los Angeles Lakers (9:40 PM) https://t.co/vvs3mnBiS1Sacramento Kings -4 road favorites tonight in LA with no Lebron. 231.5 o/u #SacramentoProud@thekingsherald Shit, “Sacramento Kings are a lock” 🤦🏽‍♂️ please don’t jinx us tonight@CarmichaelDave Seattle also has a much larger metro population.

(NOT saying that’s what happened in Seattle)@SacramentoKings Why do we never wear purple jerseys anymore?It feels like the Kings went from having a plethora of solid options to back up Sabonis at the 5 to no one they can rely on on a nightly basis.

With a need for a dependable back center, can DeMarcus Cousins fill that role in Sacramento?
