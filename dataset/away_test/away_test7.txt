I expect them to win - therefore I expect them to dictate the pace of the game which will result in #ChicagoBulls limited possessions as well.Chicago Bulls FIRST QUARTER TEAM TOTAL UNDER 25.5 (-115) 🏀 #NBA

Explore "Deadfellaz x Bulls: DeadBull" by @psych_nft. https://t.co/RWJNgNFzcZAn "Auroch?" An "auroch" is the earliest ancestor of a bull. The team deliberately chose this animal to evoke the idea of being early in the web3 NFT space, testing and learning along with O.G. NFT fanatics.

Explore "Bobby Hundreds x Bulls: Chicago Bulls" by @bobbyhundreds. https://t.co/5smbWD1p4mThe @chicagobulls tapped into the creativity of Web3 artists to envision new logos for fans, minted as 1/1 NFTs!

The organization tasked 23 digital artists to recreate their logo for “The Auroch’s” Collection, auctioned via @Coinbase_NFT using a @thirdweb NFT contract. https://t.co/q3gdSgBX5vThe @chicagobulls are one of the NBA's most progressive franchises.

Best: Trade DeRozan, Vucevic, &amp; Caruso while they have value &amp; re-tool around Zach LaVine / Patrick Williams
