Just saying.Don’t sleep on the @utahjazz 😎@cyruszuo @TribTomWharton @kslsports @utahjazz @Lakers I didn't say it was the right move.  Just said that's what they would be doing if the trade for Westbrook.  It would be a trade with the intention to lose more.  

It's not just Victor that makes this draft great.  The #2 pick is also amazing and it's pretty deep after that.UTAH Jazz defeats the New Orleans Pelicans 122-121 #gameoflife https://t.co/8OgNbrBso7@sportsiren @utahjazz @NBA @BuckleUpBoler @bigTbailey 3 games in 3 nights in 3 cities for @sportsiren

Tanking is the path to failure b/c you have an 82% chance of NOT getting #1!@kslsports @utahjazz @Lakers Westbrook would be bought out.  Chances of getting a top pick this draft year increase.

https://t.co/iv3vgcAKFj https://t.co/sPM6Td57eF@ATTSportsNetRM @utahjazz What channel on YouTube TV?Is it just me but thru 3 games of the NBA season the Utah Jazz has played the best of any team in the leagueWhat the Utah Jazz's hot start to the season means for fantasy 
https://t.co/RXYXFNTC05 via @YouTube@abraham_akuei @crisis_buchanan @utahjazz That’s not how the NBA works bud. Every team has to fill the 15 required roster spots and has a set rotation of the best players. 

The Jazz clearly like the potential both of those players have but that doesn’t mean they get meaningful playing time right away. Has to be earned.Lauri Markkanen Is Better Than Any Of Us Thought. Here's how it happened. https://t.co/suGJYsOqET via @YouTube #nba #utahjazz #NBA #BullsNationrandom sports note... shocked that after trading its two best players the Utah Jazz are 3-0 after facing 3 playoff teams....First of 2️⃣ games against the Rockets!

Dear NBA’s best teams,

The Utah Jazz have proven that the best way to win is to unload your star players. 

As an unofficial representative of the Knicks, we are happy to take your team’s star players in order to help you win. 

The Knicks just want to help. #Knicks@LegionHoops The fact that Jazz is on the list is laughable 😂😂. 
We all know this is just a "start of the season streak"

It's part of a natural rebuild. Your implication that the Jazz are tanking is weak. It is a valid argument though to knock the Pels for losing to a team that's never played together before. Even if Ingram was out.@Yourewrong21 @SincerelyKammm @PelicansNBA @utahjazz You’re right, the players are not trying to lose. But the GM who put this roster together absolutely is.

They continue to dominate 3-pt differential (147-72), BUT are more efficient in ball movement, leading to ⬆️ assists.

The start is unsustainable, but Lauri Markkanen &amp; co. are not the stepping stone many assumed. https://t.co/mrit3ZZus9No new injuries for the @utahjazz tonight against Houston.

#1. @utahjazz #TakeNote Clear best team in the NBA

#2. @Timberwolves They have Rudy + only loss to Utah

#3. @nuggets Great team, only loss to Utah.

#4. @PelicansNBA Solid team, only loss to Utah.

#5. @cavs one loss but they have @spidadmitchellThe @utahjazz are going to go #UNDEFEATED... until they lose their 1st gameThe @utahjazz are going to win the WCF &amp; be in the #NBAFinalsCaptain Obvious point: The Utah Jazz (3-0) need to quickly offload more of their quality veterans (Mike Conley, Jordan Clarkson, Malik Beasley, etc) if they want to go all-in on the Victor Wembanyama tankathon@ayepeete @LegionHoops Lol I thought you were implying something else. But yeah they got contenders up there and hella random Utah Jazz lmao might as well put Portland up there too... flow that comes with such "on the fly" situations, its protagonists and characters, that is just too appealing for me, with my sports roots being european football.... and the givens of approaching nearly 2 decades of Utah Jazz fandom. 😄There's a lot of #overreaction with the @UtahJazz good start. It's not sustainable. However it is biodegradable with a low carbon footprint. #NBA #UtahJazzALERT: New high roller bet posted!

These gimps came out too full and took a HOME L that should've never happened... TRAILED by 17 in the fourth...

On the other hand, I hope we will immediately start losing and get a top 5 pick.@franfraschilla @Suns @CP3 @NBA @utahjazz In the basketball book, there's a photo of John Stockton under the term "point guard".What makes sense to you right now?

We love our Jazz but wish we had the ability to watch them play without having to switch providers. Any solutions would be appreciated.

2. Will Hardy is #COY so far. He can actually lead the team to wins in OT and after losing large 4th Q leads.

I think they may be a bit exhausted after 2 overtime games and this one being back to back flying from New Orleans to Houston and playing in the same day. We will see tonight!I love seeing the @utahjazz win despite everyone writing them off as an easy game. 

3-0?

@NBASarah and @DadShammdad break down what happened against the Nuggets and Timberwolves plus some other stuff from around the league. https://t.co/w45HdSRpEJDonovan turned the ball over and missed the final shot in the last 25 seconds to send it to OT. @cavs won but do we really miss him that bad? #UtahJazz #ClevelandCavaliers@utahjazz @JVando 😫😫wolves fans were the first to see this man’s true potential.. damn shame to see him gone but I know the jazz fans will treat him wellNew Orleans Pelicans star forwards Zion Williamson and Brandon Ingram sustained injuries during Sunday night's 122-121 overtime loss to the visiting Utah Jazz. https://t.co/YG9S9hdzJk#76ers fans if you want to understand why we need a new head coach and have a real-world example, re-play last night's game between the #Pelicans and the #utahjazz. Pay attention to the coaches's decisions; the answer is there. #WillieGreen #WillHardy https://t.co/9EF0dMXdsRWhat kind of slush fund budget is there for #BYUFootball to get a teamwork/grit power point presentation from the 2022 #utahjazz? Could Ryan Smith give Kalani a discount?PSA: The @utahjazz are off to a 3-0 start, and have a group of guys that are actually incredibly fun to watch. Will Hardy for COY! #TakeNote@utahjazz what streaming service can I watch games on?Why the fuck are the Utah jazz actually really good@utahjazz @UofUHealth All-Star for sure.

#utahjazz #TakeNote https://t.co/6rOFQxDzhFLakers need Beasley, Clarkson, and maybe Rudy and Conley don’t ruin the plan @utahjazzUtah Jazz really forget they are tanking. Props to Lauri for 31 pts🔥We are supposed to be tanking with the Utah Jazz but so far it ain't happening 😂😂😂😂Three different games and three different formulas have led to three straight wins for the @utahjazz. 

Will Hardy continues to change the game plan, and the Jazz keep winning.

It’s the perfect possible place for Lauri to flourish and I really, really hope they keep him. #takenote #utahjazz@BuckleUpBoler @utahjazz That was a nice shot by Kelly but I have to give credit to Lauri for the save in regulation!

Overtime losing sucks but you played well.
Be proud of your team they did their best to win but it wasn't enough unfortunately. Markkanen was on Fire tonight and that was difference this time. Thanks for exciting and entertaining game. Greetings from Finland.Jazz &gt; lakers

#GoJazz #NBA #Team49@Simeon_Hytale @Dohertyboy03 @WashedJoshy @PelicansNBA @utahjazz Did Zion really got benched?
I watched the game from Finnish stream ( i live in Finland ) and it looked in my eyes that Zion hurt himself when Clarkson blocked him. So was it injury or benching why Zion didn't finish the game?Technically, New Orleans won by default because the Utah Jazz were originally set in New Orleans as the N.O. Jazz.
So the pels are still 3-0 https://t.co/JLrmlD5HUX@Ayomibless30BG @PelicansNBA @utahjazz I think after extra time@utahjazz 💛💛💛💛Go Jazz💛💛💛💛Nice start @utahjazz ahh 3-0 #takenoteLebron wishing he played for the Utah Jazz instead of the lakersWe just want our respect!! @utahjazz 🤷‍♂️@wyattjarvis08 @Perrythefatpuss @PelicansNBA @utahjazz said no one ever@utahjazz No but I had the easy travel not being called@readyplayer3_ @MattFrancis_ @utahjazz Jazz aren't getting Victor Wembanyama.Someone forgot to tell the @utahjazz how tanking works@DallasAmiker Strategic substitutions.

The Pelicans were able to overcome a 14-point deficit to force OT but fell short with no Brandon Ingram@PelicansNBA @utahjazz It happens man, a loss was going to happen eventually.

Sexton to the Grizzlies 🐻Every Jazz fan give @AlmaBean23 a follow. He will be live tweeting games on his personal account this season and we will post his recaps after every game!

So nice to have a front court of Olynyk, Markkanen, &amp; Kessler/Vanderbilt.

(Such a big contrast compared to the old Jazz of just Rudy Gobert surrounded by Conley, JC, Don, &amp; Royce.)

#TakeNote@bensnfts Because the Utah Jazz are going to defy odds and do itThis Jazz team is so much more fun than last years team #utahjazzThe Utah jazz actually good?are the utah jazz a threat to make the playoffs???Are the @utahjazz for real?@rL_Galaxyz @utahjazz Exactly..

Pels have lost last 3 such games.

Last win was 3/27/22 vs. @Lakers 
They trailed by 20 at the half in that game.

They are 0-12 when it's against the @utahjazz@PelicansNBA I need to know who paid off these refs for the @utahjazz@utahjazz look like they play for Spirit Airlines 😭Great 1st Half in New Orleans. @utahjazz lead 63-53 at the half

#TakeNoteUtah Jazz are a gritty, "playing with house money" type of team full of players hungry because their former franchises "didn't want them"

I do wonder how long it's going to take before Danny Ainge starts calling teams to take their veterans

They look nice and playing togetherSexton has to learn to have a little more control. His speed is too fast for himself. #utahjazzThose yellow jerseys look good when we’re winnin y’all. @utahjazz #TakeNoteVery impressed with the Utah Jazz.The @utahjazz have somehow become way more fun, way more formidable, and way more unpredictable by trading away Rudy, Donovan and Bojan.
