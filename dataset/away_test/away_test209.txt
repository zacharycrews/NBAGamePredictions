They don’t. The team relocation was literally a front for big real estate to gentrify Brooklyn.@ItBegins2012 @BrooklynNets @Patty_Mills @BucketsONeale00 He didn’t say he disagreed with it, he said some BS about how not all of it represented him. And it took him a week to do it. I didn’t pick and choose anything. He should’ve done that within an hour, not a week later.

Who is Joe Tsai (a hypocrite btw) to give another human things to do when he himself said he isn’t antisemitic? So Kyrie has to do what if he isn’t antisemitic ? You aren’t making sense. Players and many more are seeing through this now.@ItBegins2012 @BrooklynNets @Patty_Mills @BucketsONeale00 Look at the replies to any tweet about Kyrie and there are hundreds of people saying the movie is correct. He gave them legitimacy and knew exactly what he was doing and refused to apologize for a week after. He should never play again. 5 game is certainly not a harsh punishment.@verydon1 @BrooklynNets @Patty_Mills @BucketsONeale00 What does that have to do with what Kyrie did? The man never said anything about Jewish people, silver and Tsai themselves said he isn’t antisemitic , he said he was not;he offered To donate half a million to fighting antisemitism so yes at this point enough is enough. Free Kyrie@HarrisonKrank T  we ll that to the Brooklyn Nets@BrooklynNets is Ben playing tonight@ItBegins2012 @BrooklynNets @Patty_Mills @BucketsONeale00 What you’ll never understand is that Jewish people are sensitive to anti semitic comments gaining legitimacy because it literally led to the mass extermination of our ancestors as recently as the 1930s. As much as I love the nets, that’s more important to me than basketball.@extrastatmuse @KDTrey5 @Durantmuse @NetsMuse @BrooklynNets @EthosNets Why is Brooklyn trash though I don’t get it@WillNetsFan @BrooklynNets @KDTrey5 @wacchi1013 @24_camthomas Sactown playing right now like they are dangerous 😈, can nets stop them?@ItBegins2012 @BrooklynNets @Patty_Mills @BucketsONeale00 He hasn’t condemned the movie, the things they asked him to do are completely reasonable and could’ve been completed in a week. Imo, if I owned the team, I’d say the harm he caused by continuing to give antisemitics legitimacy disqualifies him from ever playing on this team again@BrooklynNets @YESNetwork Seth love scramento so much, lets go nets@evnholt @glamfun @ForgotaboutDay @excitebikee @BrooklynNets @celtics @FCHWPO No, he would try to get a Kyrie back on the court so he can get paid since JB is VP of the players union.@RealSkipBayless

Dislike: Everything about the mess that is the Brooklyn Nets at the moment.@breezenahan @WorldOfCeltics @SynergySST @celtics @NBA @BrooklynNets @Suns @dallasmavs @warriors @utahjazz @trailblazers Without Robert Williams the Celtics were still a great defense. Brown has been bad defensively this season and Al has regressed some. Switches have been poor by their standards and they have trouble defending the pick and roll. Time lord will help but he’s not gonna solve it all.if the Sacramento Kings beat the Brooklyn Nets tonight.. im gonna be Sicc as hell. 🤦🏿‍♂️1 of 2: What the actual fuck is the @NBA and @BrooklynNets and @joetsai1999 and @TheNBPA doing about this @KyrieIrving situation because this is absurd.
