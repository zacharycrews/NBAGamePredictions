https://t.co/r6OSPAQpVgCall Me Crazy, But I Think The Miami Heat Should Trade For Westbrook.. He Fits Their Culture Better Than Kyle Lowry To Me, So I'd Trade Kyle Lowry &amp; Duncan Robinson To LA For Westbrook &amp; The 2 1st Round Picks ('27 &amp; '29).. Works For Both Teams In My Opinion@MiamiHEAT WE WANT JOVIC!!! WE WANT JOVIC!!! WE WANT JOVIC!!! WE WANT JOVIC!!! WE WANT JOVIC!!!

Trade Westbrook and Pippen Jr. for Lowry and Robinson. See how Russ plays with Heat since Heat has shooters.

Can Miami Fin its second win 🤷‍♂️

Here are 2 things I’m clued into that might make it possible 🔎

#heatculture #RipCity #nba https://t.co/squTAduTCPAtletas do Miami Heat Dwyane Wade eUdonis Haslem ; e o treinador do Heat, Pat Riley.@MiamiHEAT Heat offense - bottom 3 in the league!! Sad.Miami Heat ML. Heat 6-2 Last 8 Vs Blazers. After a rough start this a good spot for them to get a dub. https://t.co/jhpuNvE0XY@MiamiHEAT Ur Mom's@vllsera @ZachSieIer @MiamiHEAT Ain’t that embid or am I tripping@MiamiHEAT @FTX_Official duncan got the same face i got for this season@SpikeReacts_ If I start an esports team and hire the best players and we win the championship did I as the owner pay 2 win? So yes pay 2 win can work just like in any other sport. Think Miami heat with bosh wade and james.Hear me out @MiamiHEAT, we need a PF and bit more help to score.. these two guys can make up for that

I would go with Lauri over Bojan because of the age, but I believe that Detroit will more likely give in to a trade

Now that Duncan is getting less minutes, trade him.. https://t.co/5w3hCqLqKk🇺🇸🏀 Miami Heat at Portland Trail Blazers Live Stream &amp; Tips – Trail Blazers To Retain 100% NBA Record

The Miami Heat series exposed serious flaws in Trae's game. Doubling him as soon as he touches the ball renders him less effective simply because he's much smaller.@iDropDotz I’m your source for every Heat side. Took them Saturday, faded Monday and now again on them. They match up well w Portland. Miami is one win away from the finals and people are crying over a 1-3 start.

1) when, if ever, will ownership dip into the tax

2) what draft capital Miami is willing to come off of to improve the team

Rarely will you see a quality spot to buy low this early into the season but the 1-3 Heat fit the criteria. Miami needs to bounce back tonight with the warriors on deck and I expect them to take care of a VERY mediocre Portland team. Good luck!
