#NBA #TakeNote #utahjazz@utahjazz @ATTSportsNetRM I am not a Jazz or Pelicans fan, but Utah can win. Utah, please remember to box out and crash the boards. The Jazz can't allow JONAS VALANCIUNAS to get more than 10 rebounds. Shut down Valanciunas and Utah wins. The Pelicans win due to outrebounding the other teams.

plus rookie Walker Kessler@LakersDailyCom The Utah Jazz, lol.Pelicans have the free flowing Utah Jazz today. Their a team that was counted out with nothing to lose so that makes them more dangerous than a lot of these “top teams” in the leagueIf lakers fall 0-3 after this game they have to make the Russ trade with the Utah jazz for Lauri markkanen and Jordan clarkson and probably throw in the 2027 FRP@utahjazz @ATTSportsNetRM @ZoneSportsNet @kslnewsradio Most exciting season ever, I’m super excited to watch this group beat every title contender 😂[Twitter] Shoutout to our rook for a shoe deal

Their game plan remains the same: work harder, and do the little things better. https://t.co/jibxnPWmZ7I could really see the Utah Jazz make a really good run this season. Both the Cavs and Jazz made a great trade deal.

Utah Jazz - New Orleans Pelicans 
Pelicans -2.5 1Q

Washington Wizards - Cleveland Cavaliers
Kristaps Porzingis: Under 19.5 POne of my favorite ways to bet team win totals is to wait for the lines to move after the first few games. Here's one that I couldn't resist:

Utah Jazz u27.5 wins (-118) (FD)Using @wagesofwins academically tested basketball metric, rookie C Walker Kessler is off to a strong start for the Utah Jazz, posting a 19.3 Berri48 through two games. https://t.co/wauCPKkw0nJust a reminder that Will Hardy is the only undefeated coach in the league- 100% win rate throughout his career. Head and shoulders above Mike Budenholzer, the next best coach, who has only* won 68.9% of his games. #UtahJazz #TakeNote #TankNote #GameDaySo if you want to tank to get a player to be good, but you’re already good, then you don’t need to tank.

I say Go For It. They may never get another Chance.@utahjazz All I hear is Conley stopped Rudy from Scoring a layup that would have tied the game in overtime. Mike Conley plays the game the way the game is supposed to be played. A point guard stopping a Center from scoring + Talking "GUMBO" on the floor to each other is part of the game.@Vblegend101 @warriors Nope the Utah Jazz.

5/5Why we shouldn't be surprised the @utahjazz are playing well this year 🧵:

Last Year, Rudy, Don, Bogey &amp; Royce averaged: 67 pts, 28 rebs, 10.6 asts &amp; 2.7 blks a game.

Last Year the players we got in return for them averaged 70.3 pts, 29.1 rebs, 12.3 asts &amp; 2.6 blks a game.
