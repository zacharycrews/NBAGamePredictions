The Jazz have proved that they can come back from any loss, and can compete with any team. It’s going to be an interesting, and exciting game tonight.
#NBA #TakeNote #UtahJazz https://t.co/jqqudav43lits also important to note, the Utah Jazz have players that could be selfish, but they play team ball. if we do the same, we’ll win. Kuz going 2/12 from 3 vs Heat is not team ball, and if that “imma get me” attitude continues, we’re dead in the water. team ball always wins man…@NBA @utahjazz He’s simply HIMNBA TV doubleheader gets underway at the bottom of the hour and features:

Today = Indiana Pacers -6.5 

only 1 unit, might add a bit live betting, if I can get a better line.

I also considered, but passed on
Utah Jazz +4 &amp; Over

#UtahJazz@Weither_ @Desert_Glory @JasonFairless @TheAthletic @utahjazz @Suns I agree with you completely and I'm a Suns fan. I think these new City jerseys are hot garbage. MASSIVE downgrade from The Valley jerseys. I wish we just kept the valley design, they were a huge hit.

They could have done a much better job while still paying tribute to natives.@robmaxwell2 @perroP93 @Reelistix @utahjazz @MarkkanenLauri @lhmauto You are correct. The only thing I will add is this Jazz team has to start somewhere and continue to learn on every level. These types of situations are critical for these players. The Suns are a tenured, proven winner. There is zero doubt about your statement.@Desert_Glory @Weither_ @JasonFairless @TheAthletic @utahjazz @Suns Wrong@utahjazz @MarkkanenLauri @lhmauto One question, have Lauri done three double already, even the scores on this game was ingredible 💪@Bookakilla @TheMattPetersen Not against THIS Utah jazz team, you don’t. Stop tryna sugarcoat a bad game by a more than adequate contender.Ready for tonight's #NBA games?

https://t.co/mb3ioK3WhOI have never been a .@utahjazz fan even though they are the ONLY professional sports team close to SE Idaho... but this current team might change that... btw if Green Bay has a football team why not SLC? Seriously, whoever buys the .@Commanders needs to move them to SLC.@sp_paltamo @utahjazz @JordanClarksons @MarkkanenLauri Stop it. The ball movement is fantastic and Jazz constantly have multiple threats on the court. Bulls didn’t pass him the ball, but right now he is getting exactly the amount of passes that he needs. They are winning and he is producing.It's time for @utahjazz to run their posts through young bull.. cone off time he's a well oiled machine .

https://t.co/JAfPc64j81The Utah Jazz can’t buy a call that benefits them. The whistle is bad news for them right now.Lauri &amp; this iteration of the Utah Jazz are so much more fun to watch than the Gobert/Mitchell Jazz@utahjazz Watching live an exciting game between the Suns and the Jazz when I heard with my own ears from the announcer "if you want a Tshirt stand up" I guess that means those of us in wheelchairs dont deserve a Tshirt then 🤔This game is going to give me a heart attack. #UtahJazz #TakeNote"Fire up NBA. tv, the Utah Jazz are on"Is @elonmusk's Twitter handle a suggestion box of sorts? I have one. Can we get Donovan out of the thumbnail on my #fyp? #takenote @utahjazz https://t.co/i8lGUdTWyT@utahjazz @mconley11 Hold the lead and close it out.Phoenix timeout as they trail 128-126 with 3:18 left in the game. The fourth quarter can be summarized as big plays with no results. Turnovers galore w/ 29 between both teams and Phoenix with 6 blocks. Also, Vanderbilt 6/11/8
#TakeNote #UtahJazz #Team49Suns players murdering the @utahjazz players and no calls from the refs 🤷‍♂️😂@utahjazz Take olynyk out lolI love the Utah jazz crowd, playoff atmosphere every single gameThis Utah Jazz thing is kinda amazing. #NBATwitterFormer #1 seed Phoenix Suns vs the overlord of the NBA Utah JazzThe Utah Jazz crowd treats every regular season home game like a playoff game.@utahjazz Really Lauri playing 5 minutes on 4th????i see we hardy started the tank holy fuckThe @Suns and @utahjazz are locked in a high-scoring encounter! 🔒

Suns 123-124 Jazz, five minutes remaining.

#NBATwitterLIVE@TheHoopCentral The Utah Jazz effect.Come on @utahjazz you got this https://t.co/NfB6xLP8lU@kslsports @Suns @utahjazz With Booker on the bench@KdMcuexpert @TheHoopCentral against the utah jazz? bold@TheAthletic @utahjazz @Suns They’re both great but not a good visual matchup for watchingI think Markkanen, Beasley, Vanderbilt, Kessler, THT, &amp; Sexton are getting too good to the point where even if the Utah Jazz trade all their vets, they’d still win too many games to get a top 5 draft pick.

“Tank Note” might be off the table.The Utah Jazz are extremely well coached and play too hard to tankThe @suns have taken their first lead of the game 121-120 with 7:21 left to play. 

The @utahjazz led by 19 in the first half.

https://t.co/HKuSl5uCQ4Something I like about these Jazz jerseys #utahjazz #nba #suns https://t.co/vhXfSWKZnl@utahjazz Jazz cannot stop anyone on defense. Lead lost and now another potential loss. Disheartening@utahjazz Kelly Olynyk is fking useless just let him sit on the bunchTimeout by Utah as they trail 121-120 with 7:21 left in the game. This is the first time that Utah has trail all game. Not a promising look but at least Fontecchio is making some noise with his limited role
#TakeNote #UtahJazz #Team49@utahjazz STOP TURNING THE FUCKING BALL OVER MY GODI’d rather be 0-16 than have to watch Kelly Olynk play on the Utah Jazz. 100%Jazzman (noun): Basketball player on the Utah Jazz; blue collar, hardworking, great teammate, tons of heart, integrity.

Now who will capitalize and get the W
#TakeNote #UtahJazz #Team49After three the @utahjazz lead the @suns 107-105. 

Jazz have to figure out how to stop Devin Booker who has 39, and need to keep feeding Lauri Markkanen who has 34.

@utahjazz | @Suns https://t.co/3SmxWxXT85Watching the @utahjazz winning from a crowded bar in daybreak, everything is going to be ok y’all. #TakeNote@Zeke_Love I think it’s hard to evaluate Markkanen. Even on a bad team, someone has the score. And I believe the Utah Jazz will be a bad team. He’s been on some teams, where you would have thought, they would’ve performed better. I would contact POR about Jerami Grant.The Utah jazz move the ball so well . Perfect mix of vets and young talentALERT: New high roller bet posted!

After Conley got his fourth foul, I’m surprised that Hardy kept him in. Want to see what the rotations will look like going forward. Maybe more Beasley?

Every bench player besides THT is in the negative which is some how resulting in a Utah lead
