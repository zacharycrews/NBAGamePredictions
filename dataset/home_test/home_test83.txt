The team just poured $215M into him and they are trying to protect that investment from re injuring the same knee since he did not get a chance to go full speed over the summer enough.There’s only 2 games I want to watch tonight @sixers vs @chicagobulls and @ATLHawks vs @Bucks #Sixers #BullsNation #Hawks #Bucks #Nba #NBATwitterLive@chicagobulls Ughhh frigging Embid...Chicago Bulls , Golden State Warriors , Washington Wizards

#FutureOfFandom https://t.co/U3qD3ThUvQ@chicagobulls Thanks Zach@NofDestruction @NBA @chicagobulls I agree. I’m sad the way it ended. In the end I’m of the mind if a player isn’t happy let him go. I will say if he faked injury that’s a bitch made move. I hate to think he would do that.

 If I’m wrong then I will whip out my cock at the next Chicago bulls gameKeldon Johnson scored 33 points for San Antonio, spoiling a career milestone for former teammate DeMar DeRozan and leading the Spurs to a 129-124 victory over the Chicago Bulls on Friday night.  https://t.co/VOhXfggL5Z@chicagobulls We should have NEVER gave him a huge contract. Everyone knew this was coming from last season. It's not about his skill. It's about his durability and not being the main piece we need to lead a championship team. We can't attract real super stars cause our players are hurt【Stock information】CHICAGO BULLS TEE / RED / https://t.co/iqm5IEjU1pThe spacing vs the #Raptors without Embiid on the floor was the difference on offense. Drives, cuts and most importantly the ball movement. The #sixers weren’t standing around watching @JoelEmbiid iso. Awesome bounce back win!

I am happy I made the executive decision to watch the World Series versus viewing your precious @spurs beat my @chicagobulls. (Assume it was full of bullshit fouls &amp; even YOU question how they won.)Keldon Johnson scored 33 points, spoiling a milestone evening for former teammate DeMar DeRozan and leading the San Antonio Spurs to a 129-124 victory over the Chicago Bulls. https://t.co/vW8XFREng6@chicagobulls Vooch soft as hell. Dragic throwing lobs to Javonte like he’s prime LeBron. Billy took Coby and Pat out when they changed the momentum. And the refs made atleast 2-3 bad calls in crunch time. Now somehow we gotta beat Embiid (which we’ve never done) on a back to back. F**k@ctsbulls @670TheScore @chicagobulls @Audacy Can we just trade lavine already? What a waste.@MaOG67813859 @BN_Bulls @chicagobulls True. I knew this was gonna be just like that Washington Wizards game. That's why Billy Donovan &amp; the Bulls gotta play harder. Especially in the 4th quarter. The Bulls need to stop letting the refs even have a chance to steal games. The Bulls gotta play 48 minutes of intensity.@TrucoThePimp @chicagobulls no more left josh@FieldsSzn69 @schlatt2020 @BuiltDiffy @chicagobulls Obviously pat is better@CynetLan @chicagobulls @WSM4O lmfao! 😂💀@chicagobulls lack of effort.‼️ NOT ANYMORE ‼️

It's still very early in the season &amp; anything can happen. But Billy Donovan &amp; the Bulls have gotta play with a chip on their shoulders every night.

He was horrible and Billy rewarded him. Pat was playing great on both ends and got benched@chicagobulls This sum @whitesox bs. .500 team with star players nursing injuries after big contracts. Same owner. Same results. 

Heard the It’S sTiLl EaRlY bs all summer FOH@chicagobulls L game against teenager@chicagobulls Why the fuck is Patrick Williams on the FUCKING BENCH when him and Coby looked great out there together?????@chicagobulls How to spot casuals: people asking for Vuc to be traded after he had his first and only bad game of the season. RELAX YALL@chicagobulls Listen, long season. I get that. But this defense is softer than Kleenex. No fight in the paint, no close-outs on the perimeter.

#BullsNation #SeeRedwe’re not doing this today @chicagobulls ITS THE SPURS🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️ https://t.co/SbHbImsYJ1@ibeastIess Bobby Fish is very similar to Michael Jordan in the sense that the Chicago Bulls needed MJ to cement its greatness as a team. Impact without Bobby is exactly that. Bobby's presence adds a specialty to the show that is NEEDED and tonight's "folks" segment proved it yet again.This chicago bulls starting unit on contesting 3pt jumpshots is  atrocious. Every game so far a team got off to a hot start from the 3pt lineNikola Vučević is finally finding his rhythm. It’s a promising sign — both for the center and the Chicago Bulls’ new offense. https://t.co/9NQ0q1IllOI'm a HUGE Chicago Bulls fan and IM not even mad at how the Spurs are RAINING 🌧️ down 3s!!
