Great opportunity for @MiamiHEAT to make an early statement tonight!

No respect after losing to the Lakers in the bubble..

No love after coming within a shot of the Finals last season..

Time to remind the major networks who the real bullies of the East are

Celtics will 100% have a better regular season record than the Heat. I think the departure of PJ Tucker will hurt them more than people think.Heat +2.5

The problem is not trying out all your players &amp; finding out who's hot.

That's recipe for losing.@MiamiHEAT Why don't we just assume Victor Oladipo is retired. I have little to no expectations from him at this point.Alright, hear me out.  @MiamiHEAT we need a PG that can rebound, penetrate and push the ball.  @Lakers need shooters.
