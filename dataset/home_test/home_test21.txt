Great opportunity for @MiamiHEAT to make an early statement tonight!

No respect after losing to the Lakers in the bubble..

No love after coming within a shot of the Finals last season..

Time to remind the major networks who the real bullies of the East are

Celtics will 100% have a better regular season record than the Heat. I think the departure of PJ Tucker will hurt them more than people think.Heat +2.5

Asked to leave the Miami HeatThe NBA announces the San Antonio Spurs and Miami Heat will play each other during this year's Christmas Day game.@clubtrillion I’m getting out in front of this before @ryenarussillo even knows who he is…..Antoine Davis is going to be one of those Miami Heat UDFA’s that in 2024-25 is bombing 28 footers.   Shot 38% last season and they bombs. You can see it.@Heatx3sc @RancidFernando @HeatNationCom False.  The heat didnt know about a big 3.  Dwade orchestrated that with lebron and bosh (carmelo too but he wasnt ‘in’) and they originally wanted to play in Chicago but Chicago didnt want to pay Bosh or couldnt clear money for Bosh.  So they chose Miami (out of clev, tor).NEW VIDEO

Share some with the Miami Heat@TheJoeMarino The loss to Miami, injuries and heat aside, was partially due to execution errors. 

Bills beat KC by 4 but again, two execution errors. 

The same way people say a team’s success isn’t sustainable, I feel the same way about some of the Bills’ failures.@NoFckinYeezy They are far. One plays both ends and lead to wins. The other plays one end and leads to losses. One has beat KD, then Giannis, then the 1 seat Miami heat and made the finals, the other didn’t make the playoffs.

They win all 4 championship rings, something bron didn't do during his time in the heat era which he should have done. No excuses for choking 2011 and 2014 with fully healthy teams.Pj doing Miami heat things. Sixers lucky to have him rs@thatcrazycaniac @deonsuttonlll @MathiasMejia_ @JevonWrld @PuckReportNHL Miami is also a basketball town, obvi w the Heat and all. Broward I feel is more about football.

Jazz (16-38)
Kings (17-44)
Grizzlies (17-50)
One of these teams doesn't belong here. Fade the Jazz Friday at Minnesota. Also, fade the Celtics at Miami since they shot 56% from the field in Boston on night 1 and the Heat lost their first game.@MiamiHEAT Lowry is just a bag of veggies  to dump due to the fact it was not in cold storage neither in fridge for 2 weeks.What you think the Heat gotta give up for sabonis or brook Lopez? #heattwitter #heatculture #miamiheat@jamesbond3355 @DannyG_49 @GSWReddit I think it's the superteam Miami Heat that began selling fouls.Honestly doesn’t think Russ would even fit The #heatculture I Just can’t picture Russ in A Miami Heat Jersey 🤷🏾‍♂️ https://t.co/B9OlJfaSzW@CEOAdam Luv ya @CEOAdam but the Miami Heat will once again show the Sixers the door in the playoffsBoston Celtics vs. Miami Heat preview, odds: Conference finals rematch #Celtics #CelticsTalk #CelticsNation #GreenRunsDeep https://t.co/D96xzQRAlA@MrWineAndDine1 @MiamiHEAT Please let the Heat sign him to a 2 way contract....Seritage Sells North Miami Plaza to Miami Heat Part Owner Ranaan Katz https://t.co/HYNNus6rP2@MiamiHEAT Izzy
22@MiamiHEAT Ya’ll just need to cut Oladipo, he can’t stay healthy for his life@DivvyBet @MiamiHEAT Already did@MiamiHEAT The problem is not Lowry. The problem is not trying out all your players &amp; finding out who's hot. Phil Jackson knew you can be off for a day so it's best to find out who's playing well &amp; adjusting rather than insisting on your stars through thick &amp; thin. That's recipe for losing.@MiamiHEAT Why don't we just assume Victor Oladipo is retired. I have little to no expectations from him at this point.Alright, hear me out.  @MiamiHEAT we need a PG that can rebound, penetrate and push the ball.  @Lakers need shooters.  Westbrook and a 2nd rounder for Lowry and Strus or Duncan.  Salaries match up.  Who says no ?@jakepablomedia As a Miami heat not much difference but we need defense and Russ sucks at defense if anything give me Patrick BeverlyBoston Celtics: NBA 2022-23: When and where to watch Miami #Heat vs Boston #Celtics in India &amp; US? https://t.co/GtwYTUTPvO@MiamiHEAT Kyle Lowry ruled out (being atrocious)2000–01 Miami Heat season@DeMar_DeRozan and the #ChicagoBulls with a nice start to the season vs the #MiamiHeat last night.

DeRozan looked incredible and I fully expect him to be a problem for his defender(s) this year.

Anyways drop a cool 30 on them please ☘️😁After an opening night win against the Miami Heat, it's clear that the future of the Chicago Bulls rests on the shoulders of Ayo Dosunmu — not Patrick Williams.
