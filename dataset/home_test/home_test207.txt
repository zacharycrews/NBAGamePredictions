My scoring prediction 127-116#NBA  value:

Utah Jazz vs New York Knicks

BET ON: Utah Jazz to win, odds of around 1.55 widely available on betting exchanges

Estimation: 70%Let’s say that the Utah Jazz finish top 5 in the league this season, going down in the semifinals of the playoffs. The Jazz now have a first round draft pick, and an incredible team. Will Hardy may be one of the best coaches that the NBA has ever seen.

They struggle to rebound the ball because of their lack of size which often leads to second chance opportunities w/o being able to set their defense.

Boom. Rebuild over.@utahjazz Old man basketball fan here. Speaking of consistency as I've said I'm 64 years old. I remember Danny Ainge in his playing days. Talk about consistency.
