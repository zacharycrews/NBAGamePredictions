They're building the ministry of magic in Orlando and I don't see the relations to a Voldermort series.@benduhqueen Just when I thought Disney was the only thing of magic in Orlando 😂🥴In 3 seasons with Orlando, Markelle has been 85th %ile, 99th %ile and 98th %ile in rim FG% on/off - a crazy differential

Through the first 5 games the Magic have the 4th highest FG% at the rim (16th in rim frequency) w/o Markelle
