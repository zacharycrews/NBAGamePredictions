Whatever is happening at home, I hope you are all well. ☺️@PHawkKenyon @keegan3murray @SacramentoKings Let’s goooooo@PHawkKenyon @keegan3murray @SacramentoKings Yessir!!@PHawkKenyon @keegan3murray @SacramentoKings Damn that jersey is fire, that be the one I want, you want one @IowaKatholic ?@pocketjanitor @SacramentoKings I can tell you’re really about the “city” aspect of the city editions, but as a fan that grew up far north of the city, I just look at these jerseys as getting something new each year. If I was raised in the city, I’m sure I would have some stronger opinions. Respect.Bounce back game for @keegan3murray as he and the @SacramentoKings look to continue their winning ways today v. GSW https://t.co/hGQHswoslu@SacramentoKings YOU BETTER FUCKING WIN@Rylan_Stiles Was that the game against the Sacramento Kings in Sacramento?@SacramentoKings @momoragan @DeuceMason @_marinadrab Turkoglu and Bibby jerseys looking 👌🏻👌🏻@pocketjanitor @SacramentoKings Always thought warriors jerseys have been a bit too busy. I LOVE the throwbacks they are wearing this year. Simple and clean. Sure, the capitol building is iconic as a building, but on a jersey? Put it on the court if we want to go capitol theme@MikeFrancesa If the Knicks address wasn’t 4 Penn Plaza they’d be as popular as the Sacramento Kings@SacramentoKings The more I see them the more I like them.we should always have Sacramento on the from or kings in cursive or sac. Never again I want to see sac town….@niceguytrying @SacramentoKings A jersey with the capitol building centered is not busy? Like the GSW jerseys have the golden gate bridge. The capitol building is iconic.@SacramentoKings God these are awful.@pocketjanitor @SacramentoKings Yikes all that sounds too busy. I get that there are tons of diff was to get creative w/ themes, but I don’t know that all themes need to clutter up a jersey. Gimme a good font, good colors &amp; something extra to distinguish and I’m in. I’d like the court and merch to have more tho@SacramentoKings Lakers should just forfeit@SacramentoKings Fire 🔥, send me one@SacramentoKings Are they more silver than a grey?@alejandrozi_ @SacramentoKings Good choice but these 4’s would look better@niceguytrying @SacramentoKings There's too many things that could be done to have it be so mid. We could have green and purple jerseys for a city of trees edition. Or one with the capitol building centered.@pocketjanitor @SacramentoKings Sure, but there’s def hate out there. They simple and clean which looks rad to meKhris Middleton just feels like a Sacramento King@SacramentoKings We want nemias. Comon guys@SacramentoKings The shorts carry.@Lakerscenters @TheMoonChildd74 @Ballislife Isn't it PLEASANTLY IRONIC that Laker fans are craving Indiana Pacers duo Hield &amp; Turner ? 😄😄😄

It's just kinda mid.@SacramentoKings I love these. Don’t understand all the hate. Grey &amp; purple looks great. Wish all the current jerseys sold to the public had the Bill Russell patch tbh@ALinCALI22 @SacramentoKings It’s better than seeing Sactown again bc I grew up in Sacramento and never called it Sactown…. it’s just wrong@SacramentoKings please tell me we get a custom court@SacramentoKings @alexbruhhh23 Matching Sabonis jerseys am I right?@SacramentoKings These are sick@SacramentoKings These are actually nice i’m ngl@SacramentoKings So cleanSteph Curry this season:

And due 99% of America is immigrant (European-, African- and Asian-origin).
When any Indian company like Tata, Reliance, Adani, Aditya Birla or Godrej buys an NBA or NFL team then it would surely be a moment of celebration not any American businessman of Indian-origin@appendix555 @ndtv @SacramentoKings I know everything about Reliance industries..I was an ex employee at its Refinery in Jamnagar for 5 hrs...the topic was about Liverpool and ownership of Sac kings..he is the only Indian origin owner of any NBa team@santoshpatnaik @ndtv @SacramentoKings And Ambani doesn't personally buy sports clubs. He buys it through Reliance Industries.
Owner of Mumbai Indians is IndiaWin Sports Pvt Ltd, a subsidiary of Reliance Industries.
So yeah we can say that Liverpool will be bought by Indians!@appendix555 @ndtv @SacramentoKings I am done with this discussion..good night@santoshpatnaik @ndtv @SacramentoKings I wasn't talking about Liverpool company but TIBCO Software (Vivek's company).
Vivek derives his wealth from an American company and lives in US.
Mukesh Ambani derives his wealth from Reliance Industries (an Indian company) and lives in India.
There's a hell lot of difference!@appendix555 @ndtv @SacramentoKings The point of discussion is whether he's an Indian and about Liverpool which also is not an Indian company..If Ambani buys it it will be indian owned..And Vivek is still having his Indian citizenship as per my previous snip..and yes, all the above companies are also Indian..period@santoshpatnaik @ndtv @SacramentoKings I don't think he still holds Indian citizenship.
Even if we assume he does then also holding Indian citizenship is meaningless if his company is American.
