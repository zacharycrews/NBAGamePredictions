@EnesFreedom @BrooklynNets Those expensive ticketsWin tonight @BrooklynNets 😎 #GoBKN@AbelBeltrnVasq1 @BrooklynNets Ime Udoka, he was Celtics HC last season@NBABrasil @chicagobulls @BrooklynNets @PrimeVideoBR Let's GO BULLS.....It’s crazy because @KDTrey5 initially wanted @BeckyHammon to be the HC of the @BrooklynNets when Atkinson was fired. Kyrie convinced him Nash was the guy. @JHarden13 and KD immediately regretted the decision. Harden left and KD requested a trade. Now KD uses leverage to oust Nash@Iconic_Simmons @jayfrombklny @BrooklynNets What video is that?@NBAonTNT @chicagobulls @BrooklynNets @Timberwolves @Suns @NBAonTNT thanks Kenny for how you just spoke on the Kyrie situation. He is not a idiot he is a King. #BLM#NBAonTNT should be airing the @warriors game instead of this Brooklyn Nets one...@LinksShizz @NBA @joetsai1999 @BrooklynNets Lying to yourself to deny how lost your team is. It’s alright. That rebuild will be fun for you guys. You might eventually even make out the play in one yearIme Udoka getting ready to walk into the Brooklyn Net’s offices tomorrow https://t.co/cWAkK9b56l@NBAonTNT I disagree a bit. I think coaching had a role as to why the @BrooklynNets were losing so much games. I think defensively is where @SteveNash had a problem as a coach.@EstherC60256853 @StopAntisemites @joetsai1999 @BrooklynNets @KyrieIrving Lmao. Is that recently?Match day @BrooklynNets. Lets gooo https://t.co/RvliERRf5t@EnesFreedom @BrooklynNets The movie also criticizes Christianity and Islam, but the entire media is only focused on the criticisms of Judaism. Weird.My guy @spencechecketts going IN on the dumpster fire that is the Brooklyn Nets right now on @ESPN700… Absolutely spot on with every word he said about the entire ordeal. Love to hear it.I love Udoka to Brooklyn Nets … Steve Nash never should’ve had the job to begin with! Udoka gives Boston the middle finger after trying to suspend him for the season! Love to see it@NYC_718_ @hochman @BrooklynNets Damn you're still a neo nazi sympathizer? CRAZY to out yourself like thatThe Brooklyn nets shouldn’t waive Kyrie and let anyone pick him up !! They should take real action and force him to the terrible Lakers for some draft picks and Westbrook ! Show a real backbone@Hinesite @andyserling @BrooklynNets @KyrieIrving All due respect to Nash , it took him a half of season to figure out he can advance the ball to mid court by taking a timeout . Great player , seems like a good guy but as Andy stated he should have never been given this job in the first place .#Nets #BrooklynNets 
✅Explained https://t.co/5XYxQpiFO0@itsnothim277 @MattyGraham18 @daddyissuesbq @BrooklynNets yeah thanks for the informationThe ADL huh? Okay @ADL, advise the @BrooklynNets to suspend Kyrie. Seems pretty simple to me. https://t.co/egt3JJ5Tjs@alex93899882 @BrooklynNets @BucketsONeale00 @Patty_Mills @Keefmorris Marks should also be fired for allowing this to happen. KD and Kyrie will not win shit. Trade them. They don’t play any defense anyway. Unless u get rid of these 3, this team will never win.ALERT: New high roller bet posted!

If I was a fan I’d switch teams.@eguarino81 @TeronBriggs @Haggs324 @HailMike @MedensEdens @BrooklynNets I don’t think you understand unwanted. Did the texts become unwanted after she got caught?

He’s not ready to be a coach @stephenasmith@stephenasmith @BrooklynNets @celtics Stephen doesnt want to talk about his antisemitic beliefs...

It might be that he had an affair with subordinate, which isnt allowed in any workplace. On top of that, he's married! No wonder Kanye shouted you out on instagram for being down with his anitsemetic beleifs. You dgaf about woman.@KingJosiah54 The Brooklyn Nets must have fired all the bad bitches if they hiring Udoka lolThe Brooklyn Nets make the Dallas Cowboys look like the Brady Bunch. Can You say disfunction . Lucky NashBruh, it’s really weird how the @BrooklynNets GM said he didn’t consult any of his star players before making the decision. What’s this weird dynamic with “power” decisions and leaving their big ticket players out of it? If I’m KD and Kyrie I am asking out.The reaching that goes takes place in the twitter world is Stretch Armstrong level… Ime Udoka ain’t no damn sex predator and he should be offered the job in Brooklyn immediately… And I hope to see Nets/Boston in round 2@TiffanyDCross That would be the smart move for everybody. But damn the Brooklyn Nets would be adding more drama to the TV show.Ime udoka is a way better coach than Nash. Nash was a great player but Ime was schooled by pops.. championship gene. Major upgrade by the #brooklynnets@BrooklynNets well done. Get rid of the coach that has forgot more about basketball than your shite team ever learned and you keep an antisemite. Happy for Steve Nash.Brooklyn Nets should’ve stayed in the Meadowlands.

After hearing this, maybe @celtics thought Ime Udoka coaching the Nets was a more severe penalty than being suspended.

Nash's hiring was a big surprise, but not his Tomayto, tomahto. #BrooklynNets may have gotten off to a much better start if they had listened to KD back in August. 🤔So far from what I’ve gathered today is “Brooklyn Nets are a hammer spot because Steve Nash is gone” 👀🤔🤔🤔There are women on the @BrooklynNets' staff.

Udoka will clean up this mess and take the Nets to the Finals.The Brooklyn #Nets are a soap opera.Ime Udoka will reportedly become the next head coach of the Brooklyn Nets. https://t.co/i8qERoUvpaJust happy that Nash can now spend all of his time far, far away from the absolute dumpster fire that is the Brooklyn Nets.#SteveNash should have never got the job in the first place. It was plenty of more qualified coaching candidates around that could have better served the #BrooklynNets https://t.co/nxRUsIw26bThe @BrooklynNets have acquired 
@TheRealOJ32 to head basketball operationsSo right now the Celtics are on tap to play the Bucks on Christmas Day. IF Brooklyn really does hire Ime Udoka in the next day or 2, I say the Celtics should be messy and hire Steve Nash. IF both these things happen, we need Celtics/Nets on Christmas. Move that Bucks game! #NBA https://t.co/JUgiiNN6Cm@ndy_Dwyer @BrooklynNets That’s, ummm, fakeStevie and Ray could see that #SteveNash as #BrooklynNets HC was a disaster waiting to happen.  What did you expect from a Mike D’Antoni disciple?    Defense is prioritized about like free throws on a #JohnCalipari team. #nba@chicagobulls catching a @BrooklynNets team in disarray.

NBA: Steve Nash Fired by Brooklyn Nets

Source: CitiNewsRoom@stephenasmith @BrooklynNets @celtics Udoka  But this dude has a laundry list of issues how in the world can that  be something good for the drama and Kyrie Irvin and so forth at Brooklyn Nets how can that be a solution incorrect incorrect......Steve Nash was grossly unqualified for the @BrooklynNets job. He had no business being hired. Now he’s fired.@BrooklynNets Nash wanted out &amp; who blames him. No one can coach those 2 prima donnas. They both undermined Nash. The Nets did him a favor as he still will be paid for the length of his contract not coaching in that bad environment. 💰Is there a bigger dumpsters fire of an organization than the @BrooklynNets ?
KD doesn't want to be there
Ben Simmons is made of glass mentally and physically
Kire Irving believes the earth is flat, tweets out antisemitic things.
Now let's hire a coach that was suspended?@BradyKlopferNBA @stephenasmith @BrooklynNets @celtics Shut up 🤡🤡🤡I’m guessing Steve Nash is relieved to no longer being coach of Brooklyn Nets.Sources Say Malika Andrews &amp; Molly Qerim Are Uncontrollably Traumatized In Wake Of The News That For Celtics Head Coach Ime Udoka Will Now Be Named Head Coach Of The Brooklyn Nets Following His Suspension For A Consensual Relationship With A Female Staffer While In Boston@stephenasmith @BrooklynNets @celtics So sexual harassment claims are OK in basketball but didn’t you want Deshaun Watson suspended for a year or life for sexual allegations?I can’t wait for KD &amp; Kyrie to get so far away from @BrooklynNets they turn into dodgers lol@bruce_arthur It is unequivocal that @NBA and @BrooklynNets support  antisemitism@BrooklynNets hide your women, especially the married ones.

https://t.co/mggrXe64viidk what’s going on in brooklyn with the nets, I want no part of itTonight we head to Brooklyn with the Bulls facing a struggling Nets team with more questions than answers in the early stages of the season.

Bulls Record: 3-4
Bulls Record ATS: 3-3-1

Nets Record: 2-5
Nets Record ATS: 1-6

Official Pick: Chicago Bulls +2 https://t.co/75haXZUpX9@BrooklynNets are thee worst franchise ever. Owner is a joke. Why would have the team go through camp with a coach just to fire that coach one week into the season. Because you didn’t want it to look like it was KD’s decision too.Brooklyn Nets are the Cleveland Browns of the NBA.Zach Lowe speaks the truth. The era has been an absolute circus. Do something. Win something @BrooklynNets https://t.co/rZDctWDTpj@ekoreen @NBA @BrooklynNets @Nike Do you stand with Kyrie and his antisemitism?@Demetri514 @BrooklynNets @MarkJackson13 Spot-on.  To his great credit, Steve Kerr always owned-up to Mark's preparatory work, and, the players became what he challenged them to be: GREAT.  They loved and respected him.  Brooklyn's own may be the best cure to salvage the season and growth into a contender beyond.@TheBKN3 @OGSports101 @BrooklynNets Yes, good coaches are able to get teams to buy into a system.  Nash rarely had his full compliment of players and the team was full of drama (still is) Nash may not be a great coach but these Nets are not a great team and never will be no matter who is coaching this roster.I'll admit Nash wasn't a great coach and needed experience as an assistant. But these so call @BrooklynNets fans that are really @KDTrey5 &amp; @KyrieIrving. Question if Ime has the same issue what will you say then? #NetsWorld@BradyKlopferNBA @stephenasmith @BrooklynNets @celtics So based on the story (which I read), the women had shown to the organization that it was consensual, but then later changed her mind and said it was unwanted?

Get your booster@BrooklynNets the firing of Steve Nash was not about him, but how the players tanked so you would hire a coach they wanted. Owners bunch of snowballs. Karma.And now Ime Udoka possibly is about to coach the Brooklyn Nets...not condoning what he did, it's good to at least see him be able to make a living. I'm not defending him full stop, but y'all say y'all here for second chances right? Well here we are. Steve Nash will be fine.Cant find Miles Bridges on ESPN's trade machine-- did they already send him to @BrooklynNets@YesImKayla @BrooklynNets Go for it@stephenasmith @BrooklynNets @celtics When Kyrie doesn’t listen to this coach who’s fault is it then? Sean Marks, right?Adam Silver can learn from these people. Jews shouldn’t stay silent when anti semitic acts occur. Shane on you Adam Silver, @NBA and @BrooklynNets https://t.co/GPGCHFYs9K@ShannonSharpe Why hire Messy Udoka? I tell you what hire that dude and you better hide ya wife, hide girlfriends, sisters, adult daughters , and your mistress and your auntie!

Look what he did with golden state.@MedensEdens @BrooklynNets Safe?  Wasn't it a consensual liaison?@ClutchPointsApp @WarriorNationCP This was the only outcome for the @BrooklynNets they will not be a contender despite the coaching change. This team is dysfunctional and hostage to @KyrieIrving and it will be demonstrated soon enough that @stephenasmith stop saying they are going to win the Eastern Conference.@stephenasmith @BrooklynNets @celtics Genuinely curious, why is Udoka the answer? Or is it a PR move? Honest question.If you told me the Brooklyn Nets were an experiment to see how much toxicity can exist on one team, I would believe that. #Nets@stephenasmith @BrooklynNets @celtics Yea because Udoka is such a calming and non disruptive presenceT1hank you to @ESPNRadio

Ime is lightyears better than Nash. Celtics would make a huge mistake letting him go for nothing unless there’s more to the storyIme Udoka has been hired by the Brooklyn Nets. What an unexpected twist! Udoka, who led the Celtics to the NBA finals just last season, was suspended by the team at the beginning of the year due to having a workplace relationship. https://t.co/KX63WTr1io@jutler_bosh @BrooklynNets @SteveNash 😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣 that’s really bad bro 🤣😂🤣😂.

Hear what #FastBreak host @spawn4288 has to say. #NetsWorld https://t.co/mCcB2veg3EThe Brooklyn Nets are signing Josh Primo to a non-guaranteed deal. San Antonio’s 2021 #12 overall pick was recently waived after an investigation found he exposed himself to team staff. Marks believes he’ll fit in with the culture they want to build following the Udoka signing.@BrooklynNets A new coach won’t resolve this teams problem. This teams biggest problem is the big egos in KD, Kyrie, and Simmons. None of these players are team players. Not to mention Simmons can’t and won’t shoot. How the heck is this Nash’s fault.@jutler_bosh @BrooklynNets @SteveNash 😂🤣😂🤣 I no longer watch their match anymore. They are so disorganized and playing with too much turnovers 🤣😂🤣😂. They need to trade Westbrook too😂🤣😂🤣The #Nets hiring Udoka while one of their players can promote anti semitism and stay on the roster is beyond anything which I thought was possible im today's day and age.
I'm pretty sure none of that would be tolerated in Germany and most European countries

Celtics could squeeze some draft picks out of Brooklyn, like how the Celtics traded Doc Rivers to the Clippers https://t.co/dGhin352lT@stephenasmith @BrooklynNets @celtics You’ve been calling for his job from day 1 now you’re Sad. 😂😂If brooklyn get Udoka, we gotta beat the nets by 25 every game no exceptions@ShamsCharania @TheAthletic @Stadium Personal issues aside, this would be an excellent hire for the @BrooklynNets.

Nash: 🕺🏻 https://t.co/R2mllJqsWZ@TheSportsGuy76 @BrooklynNets Kyrie deserves a lot of the blame. He's a coach killer. This team is a shitty mix with bad chemistry and a guy making most of the decisions on the court should be blamed.

Personally; I'd just release Irving and KD for detrimental conduct...let 'em go overseas@DDavanzo95 @rondo_thegoat @StoolGreenie @BrooklynNets Ime had his own problems in regard of managing rotations, minutes, timeouts ect.

Maybe YOU should lay off that crack before talking??
Let Joe run it and let's talk about him halfway through the season, before judging as heavy as you do.
People can improve. So does Joe. ChillSoooooo the Brooklyn Nets ownership &amp; front office was willing to let Kyrie walk and entertain trading KD cuz they didn’t wanna fire Nash… 

Only to fire him 7 games into the season…?

https://t.co/nIzcG01aEK@EogHarrington @NbaSaucepan @NBA @KDTrey5 @BrooklynNets Obviously all depends on injuries but I reckon KD will be getting buckets close to 40 he doesn’t have an athletic bouncy game he will always be over to shoot over anyone so I reckon he get to 5-8 range@NBAFantasy Kevin Durant Funko POP of the Brooklyn Nets! 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥

Available here -----&gt; https://t.co/5weHPLBnox82-65 avantage Brooklyn Nets@ColbyGresham22 @BrooklynNets Take a hikeOnce the @BrooklynNets lock in consistently on D with their energy and effort they will start stacking dubs. They have the talent offensively so they will go as far as their defense takes them imo #realtalk #ASAPWouldn't it be Crazy after a tragic 5-1 run and both teams standing at number 14, to see the @Lakers against the @BrooklynNets at the 2023 #NBA Finals !!!@SInow @BrooklynNets @KyrieIrving That’s why Kyrie was in such a fouñd mood after the gameBrooklyn is clicking on all levels, lead at 19. Durant and Irving are once again having great games, both having 20+ points a piece before we even get to the fourth quarter. They have over 50% of the Nets' points thus far. (44/82) 

#Nets: 82
#Pacers: 63Black people are the ONLY oppressed people on earth with NO power or influence to cancel /silence anymore who direct hate towards us and yet you see the media @espn trying to do just that with false narratives and attacking free thinkers freedom of speech.

Coach, you guys are playing so poorly we barely see your games on TV. We are seeing Brooklyn Nets, Celtics, Lakers, The Mavs, Cavaliers more than The Defending Champs. Your figure out WHY. No A game@BrooklynNetcast @BenSimmons25  it’s 💯 not fit for Brooklyn. Finally the nets are back.@BrooklynNets @mrvincecarter15 @KDTrey5 Vince Carter looks like throwback NJ Nets VC3This the kind of defensive intensity we need to have always. Ya need to show those highlights @BrooklynNets@NBA @KDTrey5 @BrooklynNets Top ten by the end of the yearRoyce O’Neale taps the ball away to Kyrie Irving, whose transition finger roll puts the #Nets up 43-24 with 10:06 left in the half. Brooklyn is shooting 60% and 5-of-8 from deep, with clearly better spacing. #Pacers just 37% and 1-of-14.Brooklyn Nets intensity and energy on defense is better tonight than on Saturday night

NETS 1Q -2.5 ✅

Perfect handicap on this one. Went exactly how expected. Nets 33 points in the first going 3/6 from three point range. Just Beautiful.He’s right. @BrooklynNets are soft and need him in the interior. Along with Mark Jackson at the helm. https://t.co/B4CYNLNxOM@ClubShayShay @ShannonSharpe

1. WHY would Dwight even want to play for the @BrooklynNets???

2. The @celtics would be a NICE destination for him 

3. The @lakers NEED him….the fact Pelinka wouldn’t give him a deal FURTHER MORE shows why he didn’t deserve that extension https://t.co/9Fo5SxHpGTIt appears the Brooklyn Nets have not quit

(I don’t care about the score but the activity level is very good)End of Q 1: #Nets lead 33-18. Much better game from Brooklyn tonight. KD w/ 13 points -- a game-high-- and 4-for-6 from the field. Nic Claxton with a big quarter, has 6 points and shooting 3-of-4.@BrooklynNets @KDTrey5 @mrvincecarter15 KD was right about Nash@YourAvrageJose @EricPincus @nuggets @BrooklynNets I could be wrong, but I don't think Brooklyn could trade for both Murray *and* Porter even if Simmons was gone.
