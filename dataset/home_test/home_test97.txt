Other teams don’t have those problems@nba you forced San Diego to change owners over racism. It’s time to do the same with the @BrooklynNets  and their anti semetic racism.@TheNBACentral Trade him. He’s poisonous. If the @BrooklynNets keep Kyrie I will bail on this team.@BrooklynNets are a racist anti semetic basketball team. @NBA  must accept and force owners to sell the clubThe silence from the rest of the NBA on this is clear. I can’t believe Kyrie will be allowed to get away with this. What a shame @NBA @BrooklynNets https://t.co/c4LzhQQeL9Play David Duke Jr tonight @KDTrey5 @BrooklynNetsSerious question- shouldn’t the Nets be suspending Kyrie?  If a white player had shared something that was racist, it would have been done by now. @BrooklynNets @NBA@ItBegins2012 @HenrySanchez @BrooklynNets He was besties w/ Nash from when they were in Phoenix together &amp; doesn’t have the stones to fire him &amp; Tsai has some business dealings with Nash,which also complicates things. I wish all 3 were gone but the easiest fix is firing Nash,if Marks doesn’t comply with that fire him too@PodThorn @DPasq15 @BrooklynNets thats the emptiest stat ever to back him and you know it@PodThorn @BrooklynNets Ehhh listen the clippers are also having problems.

Bigotry is bigotry and there is no place for it anywhere including here on @twitter. https://t.co/jWTpFaBXSZ@hunterw @joetsai1999 @BrooklynNets Guess you’re talking about the newest Kyrie Irving mess.

That's the thing about being stupid you actually believe that you are smarter than you actually are. He will continue to be a cross to bear for the @BrooklynNets https://t.co/QKFQ2Jp653@BrooklynNets @YESNetwork Let’s catch this W on my bdayInspired by @NekiasNBA, let's look at 5 NBA teams' touch stats thru two weeks of the 2022-23 season and compare them to last season 🧵...

(1/5) Brooklyn Nets
• KD's touches are WAY down
• Simmons is touching the ball almost as frequently as Kyrie
• Claxton is more involved https://t.co/pOEHfeDXh0There are more Jews in New York City than in any other other metropolitan area in the world. 

@joetsai1999 you are enabling his bigotry and it will be a stain on you &amp; @BrooklynNets unless you do something about it &amp; stand up for the Jewish people of NYC and the world https://t.co/ZxZZyNfcZy@mattgaetz @BrooklynNets His family FLED communism and moved to Taiwan.Kyrie Irving tweets out this film as a member of the Brooklyn Nets. Brooklyn is home to millions of Jews, many are observant, and easily identifiable on the street because of their dress. Spreading antisemitism increases the likelihood of violence against the Jews of Brooklyn.The sharing of patently false and hurtful antisemitic tropes is incredibly reckless, especially when shared with 4+ million followers. This has no place in New York City - or anywhere else in our country. Hoping @BrooklynNets can make this right.
