https://t.co/dmvqwRngKY@Hummingsquid @AG_NBA_ @DetroitPistons @CadeCunningham_ @NBATopShot @MegPatten @AG_NBA_ can sometimes be more mouthpiece than he knows what's good for him. Didn't you just spit vitriol at @roham earlier today?@IsiahThomas @_lifeofwarreng It's why Detroit Pistons scored the highest points in a game and still did nothing that season. Changed to Defense and won back to back...scammed out of an actual three peat. I hear you Isiah. You are correct.@AG_NBA_ @DetroitPistons @CadeCunningham_ @NBATopShot @MegPatten I am? @BTSMtweet this is the first time I have been accused of this. Clearly a man who has no clue what is going on.Oh hell yeah. Hey @DetroitPistons we got a Detroit poem here. I love a lot of things, &amp; Brittany's poetry &amp; the Pistons are both right up there. Love everything about this. https://t.co/nulxfTJClx@DetroitPistons @jerrystackhouse @Cheurlin1788 Happy Birthday, StackNew Overtime AMM position bought
