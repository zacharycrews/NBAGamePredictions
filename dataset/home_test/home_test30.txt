@overtime @chicagobulls ik the raging bull when i see it@chicagobulls @FirstAlert Sure would be awesome to see the No 4 overall pick from a couple years ago look like more than the 8th or 9th man, as he usually does.

104th straight live @chicagobulls game

LETS GO BULLS!!!!

#BullsNation https://t.co/9hZ9vPcYeZ@ChiSportUpdates Which does no good for the @chicagobulls after the factI will never understand why @cavs games are blacked out by @NBATV and @NBA League Pass in Pittsburgh, PA. Cleveland sports are not the local market in Pittsburgh. It should be @sixers games… maybe. So… I can’t watch @chicagobulls again. 👀 🔴 #BullsNation #NBA #NBATwitter@chicagobulls @aawolsports Another 🔥🔥shirt@iownjakesadly @chicagobulls @FirstAlert Maybe. First game back after sitting out first two games. We'll see what Donovan does. With the depth though, he shouldn't get more than 32 to 34 minutes per night with load management. Might sit out back to back games as well.@chicagobulls @FirstAlert Start Caruso over Paw. Both can’t really give you buckets but at least Caruso is active on the court.@chicagobulls @betwayusa Let’s go guys. Bulls for the win.Amazing, Demar is on FIRE at the minute ❤️🔥 Lets get another 30+ this time round! ☄️ @chicagobulls @DeMar_DeRozan #BullsNation #SeeRed #ChicagoBulls https://t.co/k1b01VM0Gn@chicagobulls @FirstAlert i rly don’t get why pats startingI can finally fully focus on my @NYRangers @chicagobulls &amp; my 5-1 @Giants !! 

Officially done with the @Yankees@chicagobulls @betwayusa Better wrap him in bubble wrap@Crazedrat1 @chicagobulls @FirstAlert Why not 30+ for lavine?#NBA

https://t.co/2CwoqbmxkY https://t.co/HfmqZFdVxc@PaulSmith248 @chicagobulls Thanks for answering Paul. He was drafted 38 because NBA teams didn't think he was that good. Where he was drafted has no effect on how good he is. As for his offense, I don't think he's better than average in any facet of the game. He's very conservative with the ball.@SeeRedUK @chicagobulls Oh it's on!Chicago Bulls ML 2.10 / 2u

#betting@DarrellHorwitz @chicagobulls I do have bias I love ayo but he definitely is really good and has great potential especially for pick 38. Last year he was top 3 in on ball defense quality for guards and he can do everything well on offense and has improved his three a ton@69boiiiiiiiiip1 @chicagobulls It makes sense but based on his minutes per game, he's been 6th man thus far but now Caruso takes over that role tonight as Zach returns.

When Coby's not scoring, he's bringing no value to this team as his defense is non existent. I'm afraid Javonte might be odd man out.Zach LaVine when reading that last 2 minute report

As for the rest of the supporting cast, I am underwhelmed as usual.

Brong it on.  #DCAboveAll #WASvsCHI #NBATwitter #nba https://t.co/qtdigkKfAz@chicagobulls I felt that if Drummond played more than Vucevic, we could have won. Drummond was playing well while Vucevic was so slow. We need to start Drummond soon@chicagobulls @WashWizards Get you’re ass out there and play Zach, good lord losing to the Wizards while you’re on load management already 🤦🏻@chicagobulls Basketball is not like football.

It’s the complete opposite in the nba@chicagobulls @DeMar_DeRozan At the buzzer, all eyes on the ball. That included Jordan on defense.

We’ll get em next time💯 Go Bulls👀🔴 WE MOVE!@chicagobulls Okay but drozan know he not great at 3s, better off tying the game with a mid range shot or passing the ball to Dragic for 3!@chicagobulls Pain@BullsClear @Kuz2023AllStar @chicagobulls didn’t you guys just lose even with throating the refs?@chicagobulls Had the #4 pick a year to early.

Cope harder@chicagobulls Hell of a fight.  Congrats to the Wiz.  Can’t wait to watch the Bulls get even betterAfter a 17-point lead was erased, Bradley Beal delivered the game-winner in another exciting game against the Chicago Bulls. https://t.co/s9S1pmCN90The Chicago Bulls (1-1) will win the next one (it’s at home)@chicagobulls Absolutely joke. Demar shouldn’t have to score over 30 and possibly make a game winning shot every night. Other people gotta wake up. 25% from 3? WTF!!!!@chicagobulls Not mad at all, but really wish we could've went for 2-0. Or better yet instead of going for a 3pt shot just go for a 2 and tie it up instead bruh.🤦‍♂️
