#DenverNuggets #JazzVsNuggets #NbaHighlights #NorthwestDivision #NuggetsVsJazz #WesternConference https://t.co/KbZEnzKsKNThe reason why the @utahjazz started their season out so well is because they were expected to tank, they had nothing to lose. 4 of the Jazz's star players are out tonight, and despite being unlikely, the Jazz could make this a close game following that same philosophy.
#TakeNote@gcowboy5886 @UtahJazzAccount @utahjazz Wouldn't it have made more sense to sit me last night?@UtahJazzAccount @gcowboy5886 @utahjazz @KEBerardi I mean it could very well be due to wanting to trade him but still not be anything immediate. They get zero value if he gets injured when it‚Äôs unnecessary for him to be playing tonight.@UtahJazzAccount @utahjazz @KEBerardi He's got a history of muscle injuries and is much older than anyone else on the team. It was said in training camp he wouldn't play every game@gcowboy5886 @utahjazz @KEBerardi Everyone else on the team has played the same number of games.@UtahJazzAccount @utahjazz @KEBerardi Yes, he's looking to trade him, no sitting him has nothing to do with it. Third game in 4 nights, back to back, zero shock he's not playing.Mike Conley is averaging 30 minutes a game with the @utahjazz. Last night he played for 23 minutes. Tonight he is out for rest. Could his absence mean that Danny Ainge is looking to trade him like he suggested in the preseason?

OUT - Rudy Gay (health &amp; safety protocols)

For the @memgrizz, Ja Morant is doubtful.@utahjazz It is sad to see Jazz tanking the season for an unknown prospect.Utah Jazz will be without Mike Conley (rest),  Rudy Gay and Simone Fontecchio (health and safety) Walker Kessler (illness) today v. Memphis
