Sacramento Kings (0-3)

The team that stands out the most is the Lakers considering they have two Top 15 Players and were Champions just two seasons ago.Lakers are a embarrassment to rhe state of California at this point ....
There only two real basketball teams in California 
The Sacramento Kings and the Warriors. ...
Atleast the Kings try to win, and warriors are the real champions ..
Lakers is just straight trash... !!!@James_HamNBA @SacramentoKings @StocktonKings They gotta be money laundering only explanationNo.14 Hot Event on Oct 27, 2022 .

Save it for your kids bro no offense@PHawkKenyon @RyanPearsonSr25 @IowaHoops @keegan3murray @SacramentoKings Lol he's played 3 games and lost all 3.  The Kings are a joke if a franchise.  They are prepared to go 15-67 most likely.  They haven't had a winning season since 2005. Lol They suckLooking forward to a doubleheader in two weeks - first with the @sacramentokings and then opening night with the @stocktonkings!
