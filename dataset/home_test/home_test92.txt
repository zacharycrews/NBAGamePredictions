Luka Doncic: Snorlax
Snorlax is slow but tough. A solid attack stat makes him a reliable scorer, and his HP makes him a tank that can overpower even the strongest defense. Weaknesses: Low speed and barely average defense stats. https://t.co/aXgbBAqzx2NBA Basketball Game Simulator: 7:40 PM ET - Orlando Magic vs. Dallas Mavericks Game Simulation and Free Picks Generated by Advanced Algorithms https://t.co/S9MDhYJs7mGAME THREAD: Dallas Mavericks vs Orlando Magic https://t.co/sdMpam3kRq https://t.co/JZCCnv5FjsLuka Doncic Postgame Press ...
