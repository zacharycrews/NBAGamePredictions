U GUYS ARE NOT WINNING CAUSE of MISSING TOO MANY 3s. Check the stat, Kings took less 3s and they won. GSW take 2s cause the deg of difficulty is low (basketball IQ). Klay 5-12(3s)? 12 missed 3s could have been 6 made 2s=12ptsdamn the Golden State Warriors with MVP Steph got a worse record than the doomed Minnesota Timberwolves.After a horrible start to the game, the Kings rallied from 15 down to not only take the lead but WIN THE GAME against the reining champ, Golden State Warriors. 

How? Defensively! Just look at the points per quarter. #Kings only gave up one 30+ point quarter. https://t.co/zOUqV2RqFvFinal for the Warriors📊
