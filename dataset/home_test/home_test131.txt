Magic fans everywhere getting a chance to see their team!!@LockedOnDubs @DogSurfRoadshow @KylenMills @warriors Wiseman does not warrant 30 minutes a night even in the opening game of the season. He would not warrant that on the Orlando Magic even. JK warrants that over Wiseman. JK has a higher upside. But Wiseman is also weighted by too many 20 yo’s on the roster. So its not fair to team.Rough day yesterday. Reads were good but it didnt go out way. Hoping for a bounce back today.

https://t.co/jGa4jHJJTsAs an Orlando magic fan I think we should trade cole Anthony to the knicks for magic legend Evan fournier so he can be with the team in his final seasons before we retire his number@jeffcortinas @OrlandoMagic From my personal experience, only sit court side if it’s row 1 and your feet are on the hardwood. Those seats are expensive so you need the full experience and sitting behind people takes away from that.AD + LeBron + 27 and 29 1sts for 23 1st @PelicansNBA @HoustonRockets @OrlandoMagic https://t.co/a4b5h3uu4RDon’t forget that the @OrlandoMagic win last night against the Warriors earns you 50% OFF @PapaJohns with the code, MAGICWIN.
