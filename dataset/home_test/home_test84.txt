- giving up offensive boards, Bucks have 19, 8 by Portis
- points off turnovers, outscored 17-2
- missed free throws (10 total)
- top players shooting badly (Brunson &amp; Randle both 3-for-10, RJ terrible 1st half)@MadMaxMKE The Milwaukee Bucks trio could score over 90 combined points and still lose by 5-10 if they continue to do that lol@Obi1Shinobii @HaakonMusic @NathanJH31 @chris_bucks34 Lmao just fuckin talkin they don‚Äôt know shit about the inner city only wanna claim Milwaukee cuz the bucks otherwise they from Hartford Madison etcMilwaukee Bucks 2023 champs if they stay healthy plus Middleton IF THEY STAY HEALTHY ..Four minutes to go in regulation at Fiserv Forum and the #Bucks lead the #Knicks 115-100.

The last 5+ minutes of game time are obviously their worst. Until then they kept Milwaukee from getting out on the break which was huge. Bucks shot 39% in the 1st half. That's winnable.Milwaukee BucksThe Milwaukee Bucks are being very disrespectful to their guests, the New York Knicks!!!Can someone with NBA League Pass tell me if I'd be apple to watch Bucks games that are on Bally Sports Wisconsin (which I don't have).

SOMENTE MILWAUKEE BUCKS.Every team in the NBA is just trying to get into the grove of the season. Except for the Milwaukee Bucks. They're playing to prove a point. #NYKvsMILComo joga o Milwaukee Bucks, lindo basquetebol@anchorsawaysam @Bucks I was down in Milwaukee for a Brewer game the day of game 3 the year they won it all and we decided to stay for the game at the Deer District and I‚Äôm glad we did!Bucks starting to air it out - up 15 now -- and considering the Knicks are struggling to score like every team that plays Milwaukee it's not promising.The #Bucks had not really hit too many threes until the last few minutes (two by Jrue Holiday, one by Giannis Antetokounmpo) and a Grayson Allen dunk highlight a run that has Milwaukee up 15 on the #Knicks 81-66.[GAME THREAD] Our undefeated #Milwaukee #Bucks (3-0) host the single-win New York Knicks (3-1) - 7 p.m. ...

Knicks guy just said that Ingles was acquired by the Bucks in a trade from Utah. 

No he wasn‚Äôt. He was traded to Portland, didn‚Äôt play due to injury, and signed in Milwaukee in free agency.Drew McIntyre is very similar to Giannis Antetekoumpo in the sense that the Milwaukee Bucks needed Giannis to cement its greatness as a team. SD without Drew is exactly that. Drew's presence adds a specialty to the show that is NEEDED and tonight will prove it yet againKnicks v Bucks. I've got to admit it - I've become a die hard Bucks fan and I've been to Milwaukee just once. It cost me my marriage. Bobby!I just love these Milwaukee Bucks uniforms3-point shooting helped keep the #Knicks in this game in the first quarter... Knicks were 4-11, #Bucks went 1-10.
Still, Milwaukee led yo 2 after the first and they lead by 6 now.How lucky are we to witness the greatest player on the earth right here in Milwaukee day in and day our. Giannis, please don‚Äôt ever change. #Bucks #FearTheDeerGIANNIS WITH NO REGARDS FOR HUMAN LIFE.
