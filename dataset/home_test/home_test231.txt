#utahjazz #Posterize https://t.co/w1pxV7MU28I need a way to tag the truly special highlights. A 3/4 court pass from John Stockton to Mark Eaton, who then throws a no look pass to Blue Edwards who finishes with the one hand spread eagle jam...That qualifies
#utahjazz #BlueEdwards #MarkEaton #EliteJazzHighlight https://t.co/ykZbomB1aX@Steelematic80 @pbyrnesNBA @Tjonesonthenba @utahjazz Nah, typical shot release with the supporting hand on the side of the ball.

Evric Gray on the Utah Jazz’s hot start and recent losses - https://t.co/RBs7tIMHMs6 years ago today my Dad took me to a Bulls @utahjazz game! My Dad took me every year bc they always played real close to my birthday. 🥹 He was a huge Bulls fan! ❤️ I didn’t know that game would be one of our last together.[UPDATE] Utah Jazz +4.0 (+3.0) at Portland Trail Blazers | Sat 22:10ET #UTAvsPOR #NBA ~ Bonuses up to $1500 https://t.co/17NClQRs42#UtahJazz tickets have been given away.My fav thing about the @utahjazz surprise start? Mike Conley Jr. getting recognitionI'm sorry to the IQ fans. I know it's tough for a good two three days. I thought that RJ Barrett was a Utah jazz. It's going to be all right. We've traded better in bad trades. We've been through this before. Somehow I think it's going to be a good outcome@utahjazz @ATTSportsNetRM @KSLSportsZone @vivintarena Pass to lauriGive me a couple minutes.  It is closed now.
