She seems to be the sharpest tool in the shed.Game 1 vs Denver! Lets Go Jazz!! #TakeNote #utahjazz https://t.co/vLnAPi0fJrThe last 5 years I have proudly represented the #UtahJazz behind the bar in the arena.  Tonight's home opener doesn't include me.  The team got rid of their best players, and their #1 most grateful memorable experience curator.Hot gossip: Apparently the new arena management is making the ushers rotate sections rather than being assigned to 1 section for the whole season. They all hate it &amp; many have quit. The rest are working through the all-star game and are gone after that. #TakeNote #UtahJazzI stand corrected on the Jazz not having pregame purple gear

The minimalist jersey trend sucks because now there's so many jerseys which suck ass (like the new Utah Jazz jerseys)Well on the 26th I'm excited to take my 3 year old to his 1st @utahjazz game. Sadly being a nursing student and poor we are in the nosebleeds of sec 110 row 10 s 1 2 and 3.

The Utah Jazz play 0% of their games on national TV‚Ä¶ https://t.co/mWuzSyUzH9@utahjazz They all make millions, and most of them look like they went to a sale at the thrift store. Funny thing, I'm sure they paid bougie prices for everything they have on, to achieve their um, look, or whatever they call it.@jennmckay007 @utahjazz You worked way to hard on this.@CristFrank @RFHGina @edbrasslaw @adonsports @utahjazz @youngoch will be not only be a huge asset to the @utahjazz but great for the SLC community. He led @KUHoops to a national title and will lead the Jazz back to the playoffs. Have him on @RadiofromHell soon and he will be @RFHGina new favorite.Looks like Utah does not have warmups that correlate with the purple jerseys
#TakeNote #UtahJazz #Team49 https://t.co/CuiBXJiZXPSaying it on Day #1 of the NBA season

There are two teams I want to get Victor Wembanyama.

#1 Utah Jazz (I want to see small market teams win, I want to see Will Hardy thrive)

#2 Indiana Pacers (Never had the first pick, still has great eras in the franchise history)@utahjazz Why do the Jazz think fans want purple back? It‚Äôs not like purple mountains makes fans feel any better about the botched jersey design.#NBA

@utahjazz  | #RSL https://t.co/EU4A0dQXnk@dj_herrm @BensHoops @utahjazz He‚Äôs so good off the bench, but only when he feels like playing. Which is hard for me to say because I‚Äôve always had a soft spot for our big men. Tony Bradley, Favors, Gobert, Hassan, heck even Dok and Jeff Green I likedUtah Jazz head coach Will Hardy on Nikola Jokiƒá:

‚ÄúOh man. He‚Äôs maybe the most unique player on the planet right now. I think he‚Äôs just found such a great balance of scoring and passing‚Ä¶he has such a great understanding for the moment in the game and what‚Äôs required by him.‚Äù@CristFrank @edbrasslaw @adonsports @utahjazz I think they'll be scrappy and fun to watch...if anybody watches.

#tanknote #utahjazzNuggets -7 over the Utah Jazz
if there‚Äôs alternate spreads take the highest one you can grab. It‚Äôs going to be very ugly this year as the Jazz look to get in position to draft the greatest 5 France has ever produced.@utahjazz @JordanClarksons "Ya, a lot"I seriously might not watch a single Jazz game this year. With them not having a single nationally televised game and me not have AT&amp;T Network, I might miss every single one. They really need a streaming service. @utahjazz #TakeNoteMust lose game tonight for the Utah Jazz #TankNoteReally interesting comments from Ryan Smith here. 

Highly recommend listening to what the @utahjazz owner has to say about how to build teams, and the role the market plays into it.

I am just venting now, but hopefully the @utahjazz, @RyanQualtrics, and the staff that can make a difference for kids will not make another kid feel this way. 4/5I keep seeing that @utahjazz are keeping fans as their focus.

UNDER 24.5 Wins. Danny Ainge forces the team to tank at levels we‚Äôve never seen before in the last 2 months.

Best: Accumulate more picks by trading players / taking salary while going 0-82
