She seems to be the sharpest tool in the shed.Game 1 vs Denver! Lets Go Jazz!! #TakeNote #utahjazz https://t.co/vLnAPi0fJrThe last 5 years I have proudly represented the #UtahJazz behind the bar in the arena.  Tonight's home opener doesn't include me.  The team got rid of their best players, and their #1 most grateful memorable experience curator.Hot gossip: Apparently the new arena management is making the ushers rotate sections rather than being assigned to 1 section for the whole season. They all hate it &amp; many have quit. The rest are working through the all-star game and are gone after that. #TakeNote #UtahJazzI stand corrected on the Jazz not having pregame purple gear
#TakeNote #UtahJazz #Team49 https://t.co/j9ETqxmFhdThank you @utahjazzWell, opening night for the @utahjazz. I know there has been a lot of roster turnover, but I support our boys.

Conley
Mitchell
O'Neale
Bojan
Rudy@jennmckay007 @utahjazz This is amazing! I laughed through the whole thing. The pictures were one thing,  but the commentary? https://t.co/GLXopftk1k@Clay_C10 Jerseys need to have more on them. The minimalist jersey trend sucks because now there's so many jerseys which suck ass (like the new Utah Jazz jerseys)Well on the 26th I'm excited to take my 3 year old to his 1st @utahjazz game. Sadly being a nursing student and poor we are in the nosebleeds of sec 110 row 10 s 1 2 and 3. But will be a fun night out for a 10th anniversary and my birthday. #TakeNoteAvalanche vs Winnipeg Jets and the Nuggets get their season going against the Utah Jazz tonight...😎🏀🏒🥅@utahjazz @ATTSportsNetRM Sucks I can't watch thanks attsports net , youtoo dish! #bothyousuck@cnewlin27 @CristFrank @RFHGina @adonsports @utahjazz @youngoch @KUHoops @RadiofromHell They had that with Donovan Mitchell.Whitney should’ve kept her mouth shut.

The Utah Jazz play 0% of their games on national TV… https://t.co/mWuzSyUzH9@utahjazz They all make millions, and most of them look like they went to a sale at the thrift store. Funny thing, I'm sure they paid bougie prices for everything they have on, to achieve their um, look, or whatever they call it.@jennmckay007 @utahjazz You worked way to hard on this.@CristFrank @RFHGina @edbrasslaw @adonsports @utahjazz @youngoch will be not only be a huge asset to the @utahjazz but great for the SLC community. He led @KUHoops to a national title and will lead the Jazz back to the playoffs. Have him on @RadiofromHell soon and he will be @RFHGina new favorite.Looks like Utah does not have warmups that correlate with the purple jerseys
#TakeNote #UtahJazz #Team49 https://t.co/CuiBXJiZXPSaying it on Day #1 of the NBA season

There are two teams I want to get Victor Wembanyama.

#1 Utah Jazz (I want to see small market teams win, I want to see Will Hardy thrive)

#2 Indiana Pacers (Never had the first pick, still has great eras in the franchise history)@utahjazz Why do the Jazz think fans want purple back? It’s not like purple mountains makes fans feel any better about the botched jersey design.#NBA

Conley
Clarkson
Lauri
Vanderbilt
Olynyk

I don’t see them straying too far off this lineup.@utahjazz 82-0 starts tonight!!!@utahjazz Can we please only wear these uni’s this year and burn the others?@CristFrank @RFHGina @adonsports @utahjazz There will be no business there for many years to come, they are all too young. However, #VIS predicts the Jazz will win the Big Sky conference, finishing just ahead of Weber State. They will enter the NCAA tournament as a #15 seed.@utahjazz Starters should be
Sexton
Beasley
Vanderbilt
Lauri
Walker kessler@utahjazz I wish you’d wear these all year@utahjazz drop a vando wallpaper please@utahjazz PSA: if ur unironically rooting for us to lose, take that loser ass mentality somewhere like Sacramento or DetroitI would like to watch Jamal Murray play but that means I have to watch the Utah JazzDid you want 8000 words about the new-look Utah Jazz debuting tonight? 

No?

Well screw you I wrote them anyways

Read my words!!!

https://t.co/itwfLmW8KH https://t.co/hLkCQ1FPMBGood luck y'all 😤

@utahjazz  | #RSL https://t.co/EU4A0dQXnk@dj_herrm @BensHoops @utahjazz He’s so good off the bench, but only when he feels like playing. Which is hard for me to say because I’ve always had a soft spot for our big men. Tony Bradley, Favors, Gobert, Hassan, heck even Dok and Jeff Green I likedUtah Jazz head coach Will Hardy on Nikola Jokić:

“Oh man. He’s maybe the most unique player on the planet right now. I think he’s just found such a great balance of scoring and passing…he has such a great understanding for the moment in the game and what’s required by him.”@CristFrank @edbrasslaw @adonsports @utahjazz I think they'll be scrappy and fun to watch...if anybody watches. They'll be #FineJustFine but not great 🏀#TakeNote🏀 89 y/o Arlington from Clearfield is first in line at the @vivintarena main entrance for the @utahjazz season opener. 

He’s here with one of his 43 grandchildren who’s excited to get grandpa some new Jazz gear. #TakeNote 
@fox13 https://t.co/0sijrIRIRs@jennmckay007 @utahjazz The pictures are pretty hilarious, but your spot on interpretation of their personality is the best part of this 😂@erinkatedolan Utah Jazz are going to be terrible 😪@WolverineNv2123 @utahjazz Makin’ a 7’1” man look short…Utah traded bojan for Kelly olnyk but they wanted a first from the Lakers though wtf @utahjazz F UWho will win between Denver Nuggets vs Utah Jazz?I have a question @RFHGina @edbrasslaw @adonsports :

Do you think this season of the @utahjazz with their roster is a case of #TheyreFineTheyreJustFine, or should I just prepare for #Tragedy?

Just need to know how much my beeper will fire this season.

Hey @utahjazz  Let’s win. #TakeNoteCan Hallo-Witching, World Cup, @Phillies derail markets? Sports betting fuels @FOXCorp @newscorp merger talk; @AmericanExpress partners w/ @utahjazz &amp; 2 other arenas; @eBay partners w/ @intermilan; #interactivemedia SPAC merger w/ #parsec; More...
https://t.co/eg8jspu6P2I know it’s early in the season for the Jazz but I’m saying it anyway: It’s a must lose game tonight !! 

#tanknote #utahjazzNuggets -7 over the Utah Jazz
if there’s alternate spreads take the highest one you can grab. It’s going to be very ugly this year as the Jazz look to get in position to draft the greatest 5 France has ever produced.@utahjazz @JordanClarksons "Ya, a lot"I seriously might not watch a single Jazz game this year. With them not having a single nationally televised game and me not have AT&amp;T Network, I might miss every single one. They really need a streaming service. @utahjazz #TakeNoteMust lose game tonight for the Utah Jazz #TankNoteReally interesting comments from Ryan Smith here. 

Highly recommend listening to what the @utahjazz owner has to say about how to build teams, and the role the market plays into it. 

Good stuff from @DavidDJJames and @PKKinahan. https://t.co/OnIN2WMbH3Celtics owner blocked Jazz from poaching Joe Mazzulla #JoeMazzulla #NBA

Today, @RyanQualtrics told DJ and PK why he sees the state as a top-10 market, and why free agency is mattering less and less in the NBA.

This is an odd feeling opening night….. https://t.co/yDJcsJHOMI@HarrisonWind Tony Brothers hates the Utah Jazz so much he’s gonna make sure the Jazz win this game so they don’t get Wembanyama.The @utahjazz will not win an NBA title this year.

But, that doesn't mean the season doesn't hold tremendous value. 

Here are the four factors we will be grading the Jazz on to have a successful season. 

#TakeNote

The reason? “Everything we do in practice has a winner and a loser,” he said. https://t.co/WP4rVkB3lyIt’s time. @utahjazz basketball is back. I will be trusting the process. #TakeNote@anne2themax @utahjazz You don't know any of the team namesI’m thrilled.! For the start of NBA season. But I am not even one bit thrilled for the start of the @utahjazz season. No way I’m rooting for a 20 win team… sad !@utahjazz @Cory_Henry I'll be rooting for long term success, so I hope we play hard and come up just short about 72 times this year. 

If we didn't win a game until January that would be pretty cool.

@utahjazz @RyanQualtricsUtah Jazz:

UNDER 24.5 Wins. Danny Ainge forces the team to tank at levels we’ve never seen before in the last 2 months.

Best: Accumulate more picks by trading players / taking salary while going 0-82

Worst: Tear the whole team down only for other teams to tank even harder https://t.co/VODnmHn7NCDeseret News - Apple new iPad Pro 2022-Utah Jazz hashtag confusion explained https://t.co/4PvKeoi0m9@GrouchPotato20 @utahjazz Or maybe the Jazz should be thankful for all the free publicity @apple gave a basketball team no one outside of Utah has even heard of.  I thought they were still in New Orleans #TakeNote“The fan base is deafening here. I’m looking forward to being on their side." @DeanieWimmer sits down with @utahjazz Coach Will Hardy for a one-on-one interview. 

🏀 Watch tonight at 10 p.m. on @KSL5TV. @kslsports #takenote https://t.co/ynSiy5fOpJHey @utahjazz it’s time for you to start making the same effort to include all of your fans and potential fans, like this championship winning NHL team has done. 
The Jazz are such a huge part of the state of Utah. You showing your support for the LGBTQ a community would be huge https://t.co/n9FfvCqBOw@GoogleFiHater @utahjazz Take Note: I can’t believe the Twitterverse is losing its collective mind over a hashtag.  I am sure none of you ever used a hashtag that made sense in the moment but had been used by others in some promotion.  I intend to use it in every post now.  Take that Twitter #TakeNote#TakeNote belongs to the Utah Jazz!Utah Jazz may rethink hashtag after Apple CEO tweets #TakeNote in promo https://t.co/XH8uUBsEchSince the Utah Jazz are in rebuilding mode for the like the next 5-10 years, I'm rooting for my second NBA team the 76ers to go all the way this year! #76ers@emceebiscuit @tim_cook @utahjazz Take note: Do the Jazz own it?  Did they pay for lifetime rights to a hashtag?  I’ve decided to use it myself in every post I do from now on.  Maybe I will have the honour of being sued by them. #takenote@RaigeGage @PelicansNBA @utahjazz Done, but we're waiving the pelicans name,  if it has to be a bird Utah is probably going with the seagulls lol@tim_cook Give the @utahjazz their hashtag back you jerk@Jared_Carrabis Plus the Braves are the most boring team in baseball. It’s like watching the Utah JazzNo one should pay any attention to what that hack has to say about anything, especially about NBA basketball, and especially about the Utah Jazz. https://t.co/1V3ZU5oiQ0🏀 it's @deckheadspod Sports Night! 🏀 me and @annahossnieh are live talking Tom Brady's medical addiction to playing football, blowjobs for Utah Jazz courtside sets, our NBA thoughts (sure), and Below Deck Med! https://t.co/LlYMQBl0iJ@tim_cook Um, that’s the Utah Jazz hashtag. We’re an Apple family for certain, but not happy with you trying to steal this from them. I’ve been a Jazz fan for much longer.@Rodgersoverfavr @PelicansNBA @utahjazz 2 1sts and zion and it's yours@RaigeGage @PelicansNBA @utahjazz ThisWhen fans tweet about the @utahjazz, the post almost always is accompanied by the same hashtag: #TakeNote. But it appears a media giant has taken over the Jazz’s hashtag, at least temporarily.
