Predictions for today's Warriors-Pistons game?Troy Weaver wasted no time extending Bojan Bogdanovic, and I love it. Bojan has been so good for us to start the season. I’m very happy to see him stay in Detroit. He’ll be a good piece when we’re ready to start winning games—hopefully next year.

We want something to blame because we are so bad. I see what you're saying but look at the score at that time.@DowntownDeuce @CadeCunningham_ @DetroitPistons I am 1000% convinced now that the refs have something against Cade and Beef Stew cuz their foul calls are atrocious almost every single game. Player safety!... except when it's in Detroit
#DetroitvsEverybody@NBA90s I'm always laughing at Terry Porter for thinking he had my #Pistons @DetroitPistons locked up/done after game 2 of the 1990 @nba #nba finals.....little did he know .007 was waiting for him back "at the crib" (lol).@NBALatam @DetroitPistons what a beauty!Dennis Rodman is the man!

Regardless of the score, you cannot swallow the whistle on blatant calls like that@DowntownDeuce @CadeCunningham_ @DetroitPistons It’s time Casey gets himself fined for ripping the refs about the constant no calls on Cade. If he doesn’t do it soon, it’ll be 2 seasons of our young leader getting clobbered when other young stars were getting calls by now…Detroit Pistons partner with Brilliant Detroit for a new community hub https://t.co/m3XGqD49t8 via @freep.
