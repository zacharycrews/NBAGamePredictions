Montrez = 9.7 million dollars 
23.2 million dollars combined PLUS the Lakers #22 Draft Pick.  Get a clue.@LakersNation Lakers don't have a legitimate 3 AND-D PLAYER now because Lebron James didn't approve the Sacramento Kings trade for Buddy Hield that didn't include KCP.@spidadmitchell You ought to watch how the @OfficialNBARefs @NBA fuck over the @SacramentoKings on game ending “no calls!”@Rome_Beast Lebron James sabotaged the Lakers franchise when he didn't agree with the more natural fit, Sacramento Kings 3-point shooter Buddy Hield at only 22.5 million dollars per season instead of Westbrook's 44 million dollars per season.@richiegrimes123 @TheCurtis2x @jayrokk12 @BenStinar Thats a lot of ifs but I respect your optimism that the Sacramento Kings will eventually figure it outThis is just getting reduculis.

And even Worse The NBA &amp; Officials already know their gonna do the Same thing again in other Games.

https://t.co/MUbfW6hOqH https://t.co/v3g8J0h7SVNBA’s L2M: Klay Thompson fouled Kevin Huerter on a game-tying, three-point attempt late in 4th of Kings-Dubs match #GoldenStateWarriors #KevinHuerter #KlayThompson #SacramentoKings https://t.co/DP7lf6LoyjThe Sacramento Kings have claimed Anthony Edwards off waivers.@SheaSerrano 2002 Sacramento Kings.@SheaSerrano 2002 Sacramento Kings@KevinWGlass 2002 Sacramento Kings.@SheaSerrano No Sacramento Kings teams? https://t.co/WJDzVwbuaV@SheaSerrano 2002 Sacramento KingsYea it's the @warriors fault the @SacramentoKings own the longest playoff drought in professional sports &amp; haven't been since the 2005-06 season. 
Let's say the foul gets called &amp; he makes all 3 foul shots to tie game &amp; Sac even goes on to win game. 
They are still da Kings. #NBA https://t.co/5Zfpna144RSimon Le Bon has expressed interest in purchasing part of the Sacramento Kings with an ownership group.Being a Texas Democrat is the politics version of being a Sacramento Kings fan@WarriorsLatam_ Sacramento KingsThe league has something against my Sacramento Kings@LakerCentral365 Sacramento Kings trade for Buddy Hield was a more natural fit than Westbrook who led the NBA in turnovers with the Washington Wizards. 👎@NBA the Sacramento Kings got a good team. For the first time in my damn life time. Even I as a Heat fan will agree with terms that was a travel and that was a foul and Kevin should’ve gone to the line for 3 free throws. https://t.co/ZlqauMQh0h https://t.co/TO38eFajc7@realStanVG No one cares or thinks about the Sacramento Kings@MarcJSpears @CapitanesCDMX @nbagleague @andscape Relocate the sad Sacramento Kings to Seattle and expand to Las Vegas and Mexico City. Done.@Kareem_is_it Lakers upper management team wanted Sacramento Kings Buddy Hield in the 1st place anyway. Had to be talked into the idea of matching the Brooklyn Nets Big-3 by Klutch Sports Management team. 👎
