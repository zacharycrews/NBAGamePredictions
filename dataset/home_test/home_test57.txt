https://t.co/tVtXyrFDiT via ⁦@journalsentinel⁩@Gsus_2 @HouLAPhx You know that’s a really good point. That Bucks team was not unlikeable. The Clippers were just trashy, Denver got testy but Milwaukee just showed up and played to win a title which they did.2011 Buck O’Neil Award winner Roland Hemond was born #OTD in 1929. He received a World Series ring as an assistant scouting director with the Milwaukee Braves in 1957 and revolutionized front office management during his seven decades in baseball.

The Nets look to bounce back from the Memphis loss on a trip to Milwaukee, to face a Bucks team that are yet to lose.

He’s on an expiring deal. He could easily bounce after the season and leave the Bucks empty handed.

IF Milwaukee is able to trade for Jae Crowder…they need to give him an extension!!!!!!A lot of talk about Jae Crowder in TNT coverage of Suns-Warriors game tonight. I would love to see Milwaukee pick up Crowder to add some P.J. Tucker toughness. Unfortunately if the Bucks add Crowder it could well cost them Wesley Matthews. Not a great choice.
