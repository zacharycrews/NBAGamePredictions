It‚Äôs all BS.  People should stop going to games so they can feel it until then it won‚Äôt matter. Fans need to stop buying Magic jerseys and stop buying game tickets. So the Devos and Alex Martins feel it.  Until then nothing will happen @orlandomagicLuckily the Magic will be without Cole Anthony and Paolo Banchero tonight. Will we see Bol Bol explode for 20+ points? Will Chuma Okeke have a breakout game? Or will the Wolves pull out a win against this 4-10 Orlando team?The Minnesota Timberwolves are 1-3 against the Orlando Magic the last two seasons. Here is a thread of the tragic losses.
