 https://t.co/MZmJWQCycMFormer Lottery Pick, Joshua Prime was just waived by the San Antonio Spurs üòÆ. 
This could mean one of 2 things.
1: He wasn't deemed fit to be on the team or trade for a replacement.
2: He committed a bad crime or violated a serious rule in the NBA.@PranavSriraman They released the report just after the Texas and San Antonio government buildings close for the weekend so that the news won‚Äôt come out until Monday morning, when he‚Äôs already been waived for almost 3 days. Strategic on the Spurs endSan Antonio Spurs Waive 2021 No. 12 Overall Pick Josh Primo https://t.co/5gSdzVwhqxYooooo the San Antonio Spurs releasing Josh Primo is the wildest thing I've heard from the NBA in ages.

He can create off the dribble, shoot, finish at the rim, rebound and had plenty of upside to his game.

There has to be something crazy going on behind the scenes.Just spoke with one league executive that said he was "shocked" reading that Joshua Primo was waived by the Spurs. 

Nobody around the league seems to know what happened between San Antonio and Primo.If I had to wildly speculate...  The Spurs released Primo because he had second thoughts about being in San Antonio.  #Spurs #PorVidaWith that core long gone in San Antonio, it's getting harder and harder to hide what happens behind closed doors in San Antonio

Still love my Spurs, but damn... https://t.co/5yAfCVx3Jg@RobertONeill31 the phrase "the san antonio spurs are going to be 4-2" is not something i expected to tweet this yearThe Spurs announce they have waived Josh Primo

https://t.co/xPkWdRhtM9@Lakerscenters @Kareem_is_it If THT had remained with the Lakers, he would have been on the 2nd Unit.
