The Pistons made a lot of improvements last year late in the season. They also made vital roster moves in the off-season by drafting Jaden Ivey and signing Bojan Bogdanovic. That should make them a better team, and they will show it on opening night. https://t.co/dMhhoG6bJ9Today in I like these four picks across the NBA, MLB, and NHL.

He knows he has to play better, and more aggressively, than he did in the @DetroitPistons preseason. https://t.co/hPbFdpMUIIFirst Game of the Regular Season!

https://t.co/nLsKqxuyTf@tonydombrowski @DetroitPistons This is 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥@DouglasHolcom14 @CadeCunningham_ @IveyJaden @DetroitPistons @Pistons We're one more star away from contending. In today's NBA, it takes a Big 3 (plus, a few good role players) to win championships. Can you imagine @CadeCunningham_ + @IveyJaden + Scoot Henderson or Dariq Whitehead? With role players like Bey and Stewart rounding out the lineup?@DouglasHolcom14 @CadeCunningham_ @IveyJaden @DetroitPistons @Pistons In fact, I wouldn't mind tanking for one more season, as I've said before, so we can add another top prospect to the rebuild.@DouglasHolcom14 @CadeCunningham_ @IveyJaden @DetroitPistons @Pistons But once Troy Weaver came in and started tanking, the Pistons started getting better opportunities to draft the type of players like @CadeCunningham_ and @IveyJaden who will eventually turn this franchise around. It might not happen this year, but it will soon enough.@DouglasHolcom14 @CadeCunningham_ @IveyJaden @DetroitPistons While the @Pistons haven't started winning quite yet, they're on the right track. The frustrating part of the last decade was they were never bad enough to get a top pick. So they were stuck in a decade of mediocrity.@DouglasHolcom14 @CadeCunningham_ @IveyJaden @DetroitPistons No doubt the post-Goin' to Work @DetroitPistons have been terrible for many years, but that all changed when Troy Weaver took over. Most NBA experts say he's one of the best up-and-coming GMs. Case in point: virtually everyone agreed the Pistons won the recent 2022 NBA Draft.@DetroitPistons could atleast make it rhyme mr. media manager@DetroitPistons I like this commercial for marketing 👏🤗 thumbs up for this guy's in #Detroit 🌇@DetroitPistons I can't sleep it's almost time 💙🏀♥️@NBA90s @DetroitPistons best back up to @IsiahThomas one two punchNew Overtime AMM position bought

UNDER 29.5 Wins. They don’t tank as hard as they should. Cade looks pretty good but not like a future #1 on a great team

Best: Cade is a monster, Ivey &amp; Duren show potential, but they still lose a lot.

I like a lot of what Detroit did this off-season. It seems like they want to try to make the play-in at least. Regardless of whether that’s a wise move on their part, I respect it.
