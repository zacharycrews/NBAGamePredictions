#フォローバック@camisa_23 New York knicks eliminado no play-in kkkkkkk@NBA_NewYork 43 games that is what they will win ..9th seed/play in. They will become the 8th seed and lose in the first round. That is what the Knicks are going to do. It is a step in the right direction. I am still looking for 1994,1999 or 73... not going to happen. Ownership sucksDevin Booker and the Suns rallied from a 22-point deficit to defeat the Mavericks, 107-105, while JA Morant continued where he left off in the preseason, as the Memphis Grizzlies defeated the New York Knicks in overtime, 115-112.
