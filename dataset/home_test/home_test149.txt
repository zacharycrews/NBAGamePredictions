Heat confronted him, gone from team until further notice. NBA suspended him for a week fined 50K. That Miami Heat culture is well respected. https://t.co/twOUdtLcCNThe @MiamiHEAT are back at home tonight as they kick off their homestand against the Trail Blazers!

But I could be wrong. Either way the interest was there and i think he’s the closest thing Miami is gonna get to a significant difference maker. He’s the type of move they should have made any. KD is dream.@Dukes3O5 @MiamiHEAT Waiting until deleted@MiamiHEAT I love balls 🤪😝😋Max Strus is re-emerging as a closer for the @MiamiHEAT.

https://t.co/bmCSUMkqF3PORTLAND @ MIAMI
Winner: Miami in blowout fashion🔥 

The Heat have struggled lately and need an efficient game on all facets, with King Spo leading the charge I think he’ll make the defensive adjustments and respond in a big way. Heat -7 is the easiest ever.@MiamiHEAT What's the deal with Dipo@MiamiHEAT BIG BAMLet's do this Miami Heat!!@TheNBACentral I mean the Miami Heat owner is Jewish.
