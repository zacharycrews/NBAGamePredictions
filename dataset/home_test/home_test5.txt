The Pelicans were one of the worst defensive teams in the league last season, so opening night against the Nets will be a challenge. I think Ben Simmons will help the Nets on the defensive end, which will be the difference in tonight’s game. https://t.co/RBJIk2sjgwToday in I like these four picks across the NBA, MLB, and NHL.

The Nets journey begins tonight 💪Hard to believe this will be the 10th season in Brooklyn. Time flies. Hopefully this season will be a special one as the nets open the season against the pelicans. The nets have a much improved roster and of course the talent is there led by KD, Kyrie, and Simmons. Let's go.Tonight’s winners:

Elite playmaking, rebounding and defence will slot in nicely with the surrounding snipers. Biggest question mark on him and then nets is still…

CAN THEY STAY HEALTHY?

#NetsWorld #NBA@BrooklynNets mood https://t.co/d1PYUsqTlE@PodThorn Apparently Blake has been a deadbeat so far because we all know just by looking at him that that’s his kid, her hooking up with a Brooklyn Net at the time also basically confirms thisRT YESNetwork "A new season begins in Brooklyn.

#BrooklynNetsStill not counting out those Brooklyn Nets. With Simmons back, think the Irving and KD stuff this offseason turns into motivation of "us against the world". Too talented of a team to not be there at the end. Not predicting it but would not surprise me if the Nets do it this year.@IAmSethNix @ScoopB @Bucks @sixers @BrooklynNets im not sure why folks keep over looking the Heat.    kyle lowry is their only miss   PG is important   but if they solve the PF position  ... i see them right there    and westbrook would be perfect for them@jose35889954 @stephenasmith @BrooklynNets Hell yea Famo lol 😂@Giants 5-1, @BrooklynNets tomorrow, @Yankees ALCS, @DukeMBB coming soon….WHAT A WORLD!!!! #togetherblue #herecomesduke #Yankees #BrooklynNetsMy NBA official predictions:
