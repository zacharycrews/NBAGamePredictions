The young 1-4 #Pistons  look to avenge a loss to the #Hawks just two nights ago. The Hawks look to improve to an impressive 4-1 start https://t.co/vplBpLmNdm@whodean @Pistons__Talk @DetroitPistons My overarching point is that our memory of this team is colored both by them being mediocre, and coming just after our championship glory. Causes us to lose sight of the fact that we've been a lot worse for a lot longer during this era, save for 1 or 2 "win now" playoff sweeps.@whodean @Pistons__Talk @DetroitPistons I would say they were mediocre to bad. 1 good team, 
2 decently average teams, and 2 bad teams. "Mostly very bad" is a more apt description for where we've been in this post "going to work" era.@DetroitPistons That first shot is supreme@Pistons__Talk @DetroitPistons If she's against them ... I'm ALLLLLL for them!@GMwanttobe The NBA Commissioner’s owes Detroit Pistons, Players, Coaches, Owners &amp; Fans. W/All Due Respect.

Do you see how stupid of a take that is?@DetroitPistons if y’all don’t start winning games we gonna throw hands https://t.co/ZAkTtC9CVt@whodean @Pistons__Talk @DetroitPistons Neither era good, but this era has been flatly worse.

But if you didn’t live them walking out on the fans &amp; the City, I guess it is pretty if thats your goal for this team.
