Felt big@NBA @Klow7 @MiamiHEAT GROAT@MiamiHEAT This is why Tyler should come off the bench. He's a great talent but the team flows smoother w/o him. He was doing great off the bench, why change it?@LubieOnAir @JimmyButler They needed this one and a lot more after this subpar start to the @MiamiHEAT season !Hmm if only the Miami Heat had a former all star shooting guard to replace the absence of our “star” shooting guard!I gave out 3 best bets in the #NBA on today’s episode of BUCKETS.

The Heat's bench outscored the Warriors' bench 54 to 37.@AlexMSolana @560WQAM @MiamiHEAT Scan the @pollotropical for me 😬😬Bounced back tonight @MiamiHEAT 👏🏾@Data__Achievedd @GIANNIS34MVP_ @MiamiHEAT while steph having 13 assists and rebounds@MiamiHEAT LETS GOOO@MiamiHEAT If this is what actually look like with Strus starting and Duncan coming off the bench.

This time against Miami @Heat After the Warriors led the ENTIRE game the defense was unresponsive and unable to retain the victory They must work a lot on defense which is their great weakness. Allowing 38 points in one quarter and 30 in the next is too muchMiami Heat, let’s Ride. https://t.co/zA74XRVLrL@Rodri_305 @MiamiHEAT @HeatvsHaters Good one 🤡😂@connorfrmdao @MiamiHEAT If the defender hits the ball first, then the hand, then it is a clean block
You can tell Jimmy hit the ball because the ball literally didnt even  spin@MiamiHEAT Good win. But that's definitely a foul on Butler. BULLSHIT OFFICIATING. Everybody knows it's a foul. But that was against Steph, so a no brainer to overturn it. The most disrespected superstar ever.@yvnqeen @MiamiHEAT No foul.
Hand is part of the ball on the shot.
I like the "high 5" reference by the ref.@MiamiHEAT Max striving for 6th Man of the Year from the get go.  Robinson had a decent game for a change.  Still very inconsistent, and more important, a defensive liability.Fun game @MiamiHEAT https://t.co/88MBHunotS@MiamiHEAT At one point at the end when it was really close and Klay had the ball in his hands I was generally worried when he shot the ball thank God he missed man since then the Heat were able to score more points and walk off with a W@Rodri_305 @Dukes3O5 @MiamiHEAT Both games were super tight though@MiamiHEAT Well played wording😂@MiamiHEAT yessssssssirskii https://t.co/mNogUhNgSK@MiamiHEAT Nice comeback 👍🏽 #HEATCulture https://t.co/OvNEwwO59WThat's a huge win for the @MiamiHEAT@miami_dade__ He doesn't want to be with heat he isn't a fit in Miami and it's a matter of time before he gets injured worst contract on the teamGreat win, @MiamiHEAT. We needed this bounce back. 🔥 #HEATCulture@stripclub44 @MiamiHEAT Somehow the refs won us that game when y'all committed 20 turnovers😂😂😂😂😂 Accept the L and move onThe boys have struggled out of the gates, and this one looked daunting for a good while in the 3rd quarter. But kudos to Jimmy and friends for hanging in there to take out the defending champs. Hopefully Herro is okay. Let’s go, baby!! @MiamiHEAT #HeatCulture@12sgYs @MiamiHEAT Most definitely 💯💯🔥🔥🔥😤 Good Win tonight @MiamiHEAT https://t.co/JTFRyu1nYK@heat_scotland @MiamiHEAT It wasn’t a foul tho@BallyHEAT @MiamiHEAT We are the best team in the league@MiamiHEAT what a win! 💥💥💥What a great win!
Notable without our 2nd leading scorer!
Also, the defense down the stretch, holding them scoreless the last few minutes. 
@JimmyButler was money down the line with our final 7 pts.
@MiamiHEAT https://t.co/gSjymv9NyG@TakinMyThrone @MiamiHEAT We did too lol! 🤣🤣@MiamiHEAT WELP THERE GOES MY PANTS!!!@nbadiscussi0n @MiamiHEAT This would of been such fire finals matchupIt seemed like Golden State was going to pull away from Miami, but the Heat's defense and rebound were very critical for them to rally back into the game, which helped their offense. Another factor that helped Miami was getting to the free-throw line.best miami heat player out there tonight… https://t.co/vV3T3DjALaJimmy Butler's 23-8-6 and his game-icing bucket helped lead the Heat to victory against the Warriors 🔥

@MiamiHEAT | #HEATCulture https://t.co/fddEbjRpai@HeatvsHaters Now THIS is @MiamiHEAT basketball!@MauriceT_20 @MiamiHEAT 😂🤫 we needed that dub broWhen's the last time the @warriors went 0-4 away 🤦🏿‍♂️ @NBA need different refs; refs that actually call the game as it is. These refs are bias. Example Jordan Poole clearly was fouled before the 2nd quarter ended, but they was legally blind🧑‍🦯🧑🏾‍🦯👩‍🦯to that tho @warriors vs @MiamiHEATHuge much needed win for the @MiamiHEAT@iamDustinLumba @MiamiHEAT @HeatvsHaters They would’ve gotten swept by the warriors last year@MiamiHEAT We grinded this #HeatWin with #HEATCulture defense!

It's not bc I think he sucks it's bc he's better for us off the bench and the ball movement ans chemistry is just marvelous when he isn't out there with the starters.The Miami Heat were very impressive tonight.

The Miami Heat have done a great job to make this a game as we are now tied at 107 with just over 3 minutes remaining. 

#HeatCultureMiami vs Golden State is shaping up to be a classic.

Duncan Robinson leading the Heat with 17 points and deadly 3pt shooting to counter Steph and Wiggs carrying the Warriors.

Great job by Miami’s second unit, particularly Duncan Robinson and Max Strus, for giving the Heat offense a jolt.

Now let’s see if they can sustain it.
