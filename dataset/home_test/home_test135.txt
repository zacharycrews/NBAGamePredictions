#Milwaukee 115 #Minnesota 102

#NBALook at the Milwaukee Bucks next five games and show me their first loss because I don’t see it (I’m sure the Hawks will be tough). They host the Cavaliers on Nov. 16, an incredibly tough game, and a few days later host a Trail Blazers team that should have Damian Lillard back.Well the bucks are now 8-0. It was a hard fought game, but Milwaukee was able to beat the refs. #bucks are playing like they the warriors if they had LeBron. Greatest player alive on a team shooting like they a bunch of curry’s. #unstoppableThe Milwaukee Bucks are still undefeated, 8-0 https://t.co/f4cVQzc7IsMilwaukee bucks are 8-0 for the 1st time ever in franchise history.Giannis Antetokounmpo ce soir 👀 :
