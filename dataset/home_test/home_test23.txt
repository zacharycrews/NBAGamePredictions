https://t.co/TjxgmemLqJ@mahoney_lillian @ItzYoBoiTyFly1 @HoopsReference Blame Rivers.

Rivers' offense is crap. He's got 4 guys taking turns running ISO sets (Harden, Embiid, Harris, Maxey) and the rest chucking up late clock 3s when Harden, Embiid &amp; Harris get shut down.

It's Houston Rockets 2018-2020 ugly.@memgrizz @HoustonRockets @GrizzOnBally @FDSportsbook @929espn Go @santialdama go!!!!!!Here's what you can expect for tomorrow's home opener!
