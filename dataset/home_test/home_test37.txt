When the Hawks made an offseason move that added All-Star Dejounte Murray to the roster, pairing him in the backcourt with Trae Young along with John Collins. https://t.co/uRGlQG4MoQHappy birthday to Jordan Crawford of the Washington wizards #jordancrawford #washingtonwizards #atlantahawks #goldenstatewarriors #bostonceltics #neworleanspelicans #longislandnets https://t.co/W27wwUjjgaNBA 🏀 

Atlanta Hawks v Charlotte Hornets

Gordon Hayward Over 4.5 Assists 

Odds: 2.0 (SKY)

Stake: £10.00

With Terry Rozier expected to be out we should be seeing the ball in the hands of Hayward more and he averaged 3.5 Assists last season so expecting him to get 5+
