Payday or no hahaWho remembers this?🔥😤🔥😤🔥 @IsiahThomas @DetroitPistons https://t.co/tDm8lr1IXt2017-18 Detroit Pistons didn’t draft anyone. Pistons had traded the pick in the Blake Griffin trade. The Clippers would trade it to Charlotte who selected Miles Bridges. Which … well … that hasn’t panned out well for anyone.1968-69 Cincinnati Royals would go on to draft Herm Gilliam at #8. No awards.  

1970-71 Detroit Pistons would go on to draft Curtis Rowe at #11. 1x All-Star.

1992-93 Milwaukee Bucks would draft Vin Baker at #8. 4x All-Star, 1x 2nd Team All-NBA, 1x 3rd Team All-NBA.1968-69 Cincinnati Royals started 10-3, finished 41-41.

1970-71 Detroit Pistons started 12-1, finished 45-37.

1992-93 Milwaukee Bucks started 10-3, went on to lose 51 out of their remaining 69 games. Finished 28-54.

2017-18 Detroit Pistons started 10-3, finished 39-43.Stat of the night as Jazz lose their second straight game, only four teams have started the season 10-3 or better in their first 13 games and missed the playoffs: 

1968-69 Cincinnati Royals

2017-18 Detroit Pistons@timdevaney @DetroitPistons @44Bojan @Lakers @LakersSBN first pick aint trading down for anyone with Wemby on board.@DetroitPistons @44Bojan @Lakers @LakersSBN As much as I like him, I’d even consider tossing in Saddiq Bey if we could get both of the Lakers 1st round picks. With three 1st rounders (and possibly two in the top 5), if we don’t win the lottery surely we’d have the capital to trade up!Better yet: If the @DetroitPistons trade @44Bojan for the @Lakers 1st round pick in 2023, but they still don’t pull things together, we could wind up with two top 5 picks? That’d give us a better shot at Victor Wembanyama (+Scoot) than anyone else. @LakersSBN https://t.co/CQQs24fqA6@44Bojan is growing on me but this makes a lot of sense. Not only would his absence give the @DetroitPistons a better shot at tanking for the top pick in the 2023 NBA Draft but it’d also improve the @Lakers (1 of only 2 teams in front of us). Win-Win — er, would that be Lose-Win? https://t.co/qr1aJ4z7dBNBA Detroit Pistons Neon Sign LOWT2QS
