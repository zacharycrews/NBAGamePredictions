#knicks #atlantahawks https://t.co/H8HeEEloMrIt's sad Carmelo wasted his prime in New York
But in 2011 he demanded a trade 
If he waited 4 months he could have signed with the Knicks and not force them to sacrifice their young core and picks 
He sabotaged his own future in Madison Square GardenWas just thinking how cool would it be to have football chants at NBA games, and I came up with one for the Knicks, of course, to the tune of "Santa Claus is coming to town".

https://t.co/gZxVMRB3QX@NBA_NewYork Him and MarJon Beauchamp were the guys I wanted the Knicks to take. What happened, happened. I hate to go the "should have taken X, Y, Z".

This kid can be an All Star one day. But I fear Atlanta isn't the best place for him to be at right now.Hawks vs Knicks is going to be good tv tonight. New York was tired of getting bullied by Trae Young and had to sign another bully, Jalen Brunson.
