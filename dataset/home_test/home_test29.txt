#Magic are 0-6 vs #Boston in the last 2 seasonsI think there’s a rule in the @NBAOfficial that states that the @OrlandoMagic must have 5 players out with injury at all times. The rule also states that they MUST BE rotation players and not end of bench fodder. I’ve accepted that we will never have a full complement of players.@SprdsheetAgenda The SAME Tim Duncan that almost left for the Orlando Magic? The Spurs should be thanking Doc Rivers for fking that up.I've watched each regular season Magic Game this season Ten times. Point guard play is the issue. We need to address it asap.

Do you see your team on our level or something? 😂@brandonpickem Because I was talking about the Pelicans in a solo tweet and it’s relevant to a win-now team with expectations? Yeah?

For the Magic, I don’t care about +/- in an Orlando Magic game against a far better team ATL we expect to &amp; did lose to. Paolo’s 2nd career game talking +/-?🤣😂@PackripEwing @OrlandoMagic have a breakout year behind @Pp_doesit@OrlandoMagic @AdventHealth @franzboogie Got that dog in himThe Orlando Magic have gotten GREAT picks over the last couple years that have dwindled into role players and hopefuls, maybe Paolo Banchero will turn into something.@krjie_13 @NBAHistory @OrlandoMagic @Pp_doesit That’s what makes it even more impressive from PaoloJohn Collins Vs The Orlando Magic 10/21/22:

Is this actually a serious question or just a funny troll?

Do you have the same Win/Loss expectations for the Magic &amp; Pistons?

The Magic drop their second straight to the Hawks who dominated the 4th quarter, despite Orlando’s lead heading into the final 12 minutes.

Jalen Suggs left the game with an ankle sprain, the backcourt looking very thin with injuries right now.

Paolo was fouled everytime he was in the paint in the 4th. They completely stop calling fouls in the 4th@MarcusLDoss @OrlandoMagic Y’all shot 14 more free throws than us hello? Wym bad officiating@NotThatTomGreen @dgarrinibc @colettearrand @MartyDeRosa For example, every Orlando Magic home game plays the Star Wars main theme right before the 4th period, over the PA system. Because it’s only played for the live crowd (not plugged into the broadcast mix, usually talked over by announcers), it’s WAY cheaper than a full license.@AllEarsNet Alot of the magic has gone . Spent a month in Orlando last summer. A huge Disney parks fan but left thinking that I will definitely be back in Orlando again but would do a trip &amp; not do Disney . Would never ever thought I would say that. I was not a guest just a $  to Disney.💰VIP WINNER💰

Banchero will be a star, but the team needs some true shooters and star power to make some noise in my opinion. Too many of the same type of players.Checking into the game late in the 4th quarter, @_kevonn22 tonight became the 278th player to ever suit up for the @OrlandoMagic.

#MagicTogether #OrlandoMagicIt’s a great night in the ATL for @ATLHawks Basketball!  #nba #atlantahawks #orlandomagic #statefarmarena https://t.co/jOsjtYryjO@OrlandoMagic @The_ColeAnthony someone teach Wendell how to contest shots@vincebaccala @MarkelleF @OrlandoMagic @DanteMagic @steelemagic Need this on your wall! https://t.co/vlj8endWS2The Orlando Magic are cursed. This team will never be healthySomeone tell Wendell Carter to stop shooting 3s @OrlandoMagicSecond straight @OrlandoMagic game where @jalensuggs has landed awkwardly on his leg and picked up and injury. This looks serious though. Suggs appears to be in pain.
#MagicTogether https://t.co/AF2tCAwzv4Orlando Magic stay 100% healthy challenge

IMPOSSIBLEWHAT THE FUCK BRO can the Orlando Magic catch a fucking break with injuries FUCK FUCK FUCK I’m so sick of this shit WHY US 

Hope Jalen Suggs is ok. Love seeing his energySuggs cannot catch a break. 

Seems to have sprained his ankle badly on that last drive to the basket. Seems to be in a lot of pain. 

#MagicTogether #OrlandoMagicThe Orlando Magic curse strikes again. One of these seasons I will see a healthy roster.....one of these...Suggs can’t walk after a hard fall — bad news for Orlando MagicI really like what the Orlando Magic and Houston Rockets are building, in 2-3 years I could see one or both of them being the Memphis Grizzlies of today. Teams like the Knicks, pistons, and blazers don't want to tear it down and completely rebuild and it will be to their own detr@OrlandoMagic @Pp_doesit How does he make it look so easy?First team all hands 🫱 @franzboogie
