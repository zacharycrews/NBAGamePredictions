#Magic are 0-6 vs #Boston in the last 2 seasonsI think there‚Äôs a rule in the @NBAOfficial that states that the @OrlandoMagic must have 5 players out with injury at all times. The rule also states that they MUST BE rotation players and not end of bench fodder. I‚Äôve accepted that we will never have a full complement of players.@SprdsheetAgenda The SAME Tim Duncan that almost left for the Orlando Magic? The Spurs should be thanking Doc Rivers for fking that up.I've watched each regular season Magic Game this season Ten times. Point guard play is the issue. We need to address it asap.
