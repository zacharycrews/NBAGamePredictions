📸 Barry Gossage https://t.co/ZKILxbJdui@trailblazers You know, I’d stand on a corner with Winslow in Arizona. #trailblazers #phoenixsuns #suns #Portland https://t.co/YSozged3UTThe fact that the #nba doesn’t allow reviews of that HORRIBLE travel on Jerami Grant. When that report comes out tomorrow that they missed this call, I’ll demand that @DraftKings  I demand all bets placed by my account on the #phoenixsuns on 11.04.2022The Phoenix Suns have only two losses this season. Guess who’s responsible for both?
