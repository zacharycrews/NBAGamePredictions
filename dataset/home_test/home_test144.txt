Those two, Suggs and Cole Anthony would make the second unit a whole lot better. Bamba is not playing that well at the moment and there isn't one playmaker off the bench. Should trade JI for a veteran point guard imo.@OrlandoMagic @SASsoftware @BolBol When Orlando gets Markelle back and Wagner starts hitting his 3s, teams will have a huge problem stopping them. 4 starters 6'10 or more is crazy. The defense is looking really good, only problem is hitting 3s.
Orlando's biggest problem is the bench. /Damn google
