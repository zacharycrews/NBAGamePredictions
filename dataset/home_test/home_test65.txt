I'd say toward the warriors and nets.Nets are 0-4 ATS in their last 4 home games vs. a team with a road winning % of less than .400.
Nets are 0-6 ATS in their last 6 games played on a Thursday when playing at home.

And for someone there for "defending" at 6-10 5 boards is trash.  We won't even discuss offense :)What I think the @BrooklynNets need to do. 
- Fire Steve Nash! The Nash experiment hasn’t work. 
- Trade Patty Mills &amp; Sharpe 
- Play Ben Simmons at Center or trade for one. 
- Play Cam Thomas!!! 
- Ben Simmons needs to stay aggressive &amp; start scoring!@stephenasmith Can #BenSimmons be effective scoring 4 points? D isn't even shelling because he won't shoot an 8-footer. They're fanning out 2 cut off kicks. @NBA @ESPNNBA #BrooklynNets@vivostiling @NyyBkn13 @BrooklynNets @JetBlue Spacing.  What you want is more spacing with KD and Kyrie not less.

I’ll be real, at this point, I won’t be surprised if we end up with a negative record this season. This team is filled with egos and they can’t back it up. Bunch of losers man. They deserve to get slacked@BrooklynNets Ffs why can we never keep hold of leads@BrooklynNets need to get Terry Rozier.. Seriously. SMDH #BKNvsMIL@chibbs_1 @BrooklynNets Knicks better.@BenSimmons25  is not a threat. Useless in many ways. @BrooklynNets fire all your coach.@ChazHancock @Lakers @BrooklynNets Kyrie gonna stay put.

Start with that and the shooter will have room.@Bucks @BrooklynNets @BenSimmons25 Ben doesn't want it. He is scared. Please keep him forever.@BrooklynNets wanted any chance in A season. They would’ve change coaches. But nah they dumb. Their chances are toast due to bad GM &amp; coaching…#NBAThis Brooklyn Nets team is TRASH!@BrooklynNets CALL MELO y’all need help 😂😂😂Brooklyn  Nets 🤦🏾‍♂️@BrooklynNets go get @MarkJackson13@nico_zuto @BrooklynNets @joetsai1999 🤣🤣🤣 the joe sai @ is hilarious@BrooklynNets It’s sad that the management of Brooklyn are watching Steve Nash turn an all star superstar team to an average team and they’re comfortable with it. #FIRENASH@BrooklynNets yal seriously need a coach this is ridiculous all this iso ballThe Brooklyn Nets suck as a staff, record label and as a MF CREWthats 2 games in a row they’ve blown a halftime lead. i hate watching my @BrooklynNets. same low IQ + heartless basketball w/ different role players. idk what has to change but its been like this for 2 years. no wonder KD asked out.you ass, we ass.. it's time @BrooklynNets @Lakers https://t.co/nAKtVaXJwZBrooklyn Nets need a bus driver desperately.Fuck off @BrooklynNets I woke up at 1:30 AM just to see this shit@ZBA_DBA @BrooklynNets @BenSimmons25 Very Hard@BrooklynNets That's what get for trolling the Sixers being 1-3.

My lord. #NBA @Giannis_An34@BrooklynNets What good is mr simmons?@KendrickPerkins How can you blame Steve Nash for this mess that’s the Brooklyn Nets? 

Not saying he’s a good coach, he definitely had problems making playoff adjustments but they have no depth on their team right now. Changing the coach would do little to fix the roster problems.I don't know about my @BrooklynNets@BrooklynNets what happened.@BrooklynNets  will go down as one of the most underachieving teams in basketball history.@BrooklynNets done bro @KDTrey5, pull up on #BigMemphis @memgrizz.The Brooklyn Nets #STINKgiannis owns the brooklyn netsIt’s ugly rn …………… @BrooklynNets@ReverseJinxGod @BrooklynNets For some reason NBA is at it's worst it's ever been, for me. For others, they seem to me magicians with their picks. WeirdHard to watch @BrooklynNets when @BenSimmons25 is a liability 🤦🏽‍♂️How in the world are the Brooklyn Nets struggling against the bucks without their second best player Kris Middleton🤨 https://t.co/2OvlGVuph8@BrooklynNets offense been 🥶 2nd half.

Refreshing to see a true team in Blazers hvn fun!You would not think the @Bucks beat the @BrooklynNets 2 years ago.  Milwaukee still scared of @BrooklynNets #ESPN@barstoolsports @PatBevPod “it’s ok, he’s working through a process. it’s been a year and a half since he’s played”

Dirty play? Ok. Flagrant foul? U can have it. Bet them mfs think twice tho going up again. 🤷‍♂️ @BrooklynNetsWe all know he's scared &amp; he's going to say "my lawyers told me not to" so he 'appears' strong What a joke of a man #TrumpIsScared Retweet if you agree!(also #39kIsNotEnough!)

Even though I have question marks about their offense, the are hitting there shots right now and are playing great defense, which caused Milwaukee to shoot 35% from the field (18% from three). Halftime score: 55:43 Nets! #nba #Nets #bucksHey @BrooklynNets take Giannis BS personal and blow these guys out in the second half.@BrooklynNets I think this is a sign to run Ben at Center.The Nets outscored the Bucks 35-18 in the second quarter.

#nba #basketball #nets #bucks #bklyn #Brooklyn #Milwaukee #hoops https://t.co/UYgnYDMGn4Shots like that are when the rust on Simmons becomes apparent.

Steve Nash already has KD about to play the entire 1st quarter.. just for the Bucks to have the lead.

Tough to watch.@BrooklynNets A wonderful regular season player when he decides to be. The ending…not so much.HERE WE GO AGAIN WITH THE BS CALLS!!! Brooklyn Nets and Milwaukee Bucks. They should’ve called a foul on Lopez on Claxton!!!The biggest problem for this @BrooklynNets roster is definitely the lack of good reliable centers. Looking at the other strong nba teams we might have the worst ones. No offensive or defensive rebounds and lacking the ability to score.@BrooklynNets pick between clax or 10 

enough of this shit manQuick observation regarding Nets/Bucks.  The Bucks are just much tougher and have too much size for Brooklyn.Ngl @BrooklynNets are starting out very sorry right nowPlease fire Steve Nash. @BrooklynNets@Rammygang @ClaytonLigeikis @BrooklynNets The harden trade which led to the Simmons tradeThat's it. I can NOT watch the Brooklyn Nets anymore this season. Its atrocious!@BrooklynNets Y'all got killed by Lopez shooting threes hahahahahahaThe Nets are last in defensive rating.

This might be a controversial statement, but no one is getting them into sets. Kyrie is a natural Scorer, so is KD. Although Ben is a great passer, he’s not a half-court Player!
