He needs to be fed to score (most big me do so that shouldn’t be a problem), but the Suns don’t have guys to do that. Outside of Book, Phoenix has nobody to get Ayton looksIf you look closely you can see me crying into my beer because I'm watching Tyrese Haliburton who should be a Phoenix Sun

 #Suns #DetroitPistonsPhoenix has missed three top-8 guys — Crowder (all 15 games), Johnson (7) and Paul (5) — for bulk of the season. Four of their six losses came by just one possession. They’re still fourth in the West. Don’t think Suns are underperforming. https://t.co/Lr7w4D7rbCAmazing @utahjazz win last night over the Phoenix Suns.
The two closing baskets by @JordanClarksons and Lauri Markkanen were something else.
