#AllFly #DCAboveAll https://t.co/rsptVSkqCCI watched Miami’s last game, and they played zone for 48 minutes because they only had 7 active players (two of which were making their NBA debuts). But… they did take the Wizards to OT in Washington in that one. So I guess that means it was actually more than 48 minutes of zoneWashington Wizards Starters:
