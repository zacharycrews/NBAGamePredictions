@DetroitPistons https://t.co/l82jKL53qtAccording to FanDeul, bettor wins $150K after pre-season bet on Detroit Pistons missing the playoffs.@RoachOppressor @DetroitPistons @44Bojan @CadeCunningham_ @Dreamville_33 @IveyJaden 8. If he‚Äôs not transformative into making the team competitive then I‚Äôm missing the point on keeping him-his value tanked, you want to risk to let him walk for nothing then maybe that‚Äôs a different convo but Portland Jerami is different from DET Grant
9. Troy found Bey/Stew late.@Traeshmaen @SanaDetroit @DetroitPistons Yeah I need that two tone boy bro@genomufasa @SanaDetroit @DetroitPistons I want that Teal sweatshirt üëÄ@Traeshmaen @SanaDetroit @DetroitPistons I need all partsNBA Betting Pick &amp; Prediction: Atlanta Hawks vs. Detroit Pistons - October 26, 2022 https://t.co/UpJzVHIjce@RoachOppressor @DetroitPistons @44Bojan @CadeCunningham_ @Dreamville_33 @IveyJaden 5. Yay, agreementüòÇ
6. Thanks for admitting that, respect.
7. It‚Äôs whether Weaver made the right move trading Jerami and whether Grant would help the team in its present form-we‚Äôre in opposing views so kinda is a debate unless we‚Äôre debating the definition of the term ‚Äúdebate‚ÄùüòÇ@SocialistStones @SanaDetroit @DetroitPistons Yea it might be a struggle for me to get there too unfortunately. But I just like to see this sort of stuff nonetheless, its creating a cool subculture around Detroit sportsThe Orlando Magic and Detroit Pistons got the last two number one overall picks and are a combined 1-7 and neither looks to be title competitive for at least another 2 seasons.
This is what scares me when selling talent if I‚Äôm the Utah Jazz.@Traeshmaen @SanaDetroit @DetroitPistons This is the first Sana drop I would definitely get but I have to work and can't go ü•¥@RoachOppressor @DetroitPistons @44Bojan @CadeCunningham_ @Dreamville_33 @IveyJaden 3.
