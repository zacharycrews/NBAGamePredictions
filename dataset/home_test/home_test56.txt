If he’s not transformative into making the team competitive then I’m missing the point on keeping him-his value tanked, you want to risk to let him walk for nothing then maybe that’s a different convo but Portland Jerami is different from DET Grant
9.

Yay, agreement😂
6. Thanks for admitting that, respect.
7. It’s whether Weaver made the right move trading Jerami and whether Grant would help the team in its present form-we’re in opposing views so kinda is a debate unless we’re debating the definition of the term “debate”😂@SocialistStones @SanaDetroit @DetroitPistons Yea it might be a struggle for me to get there too unfortunately. But I just like to see this sort of stuff nonetheless, its creating a cool subculture around Detroit sportsThe Orlando Magic and Detroit Pistons got the last two number one overall picks and are a combined 1-7 and neither looks to be title competitive for at least another 2 seasons.
This is what scares me when selling talent if I’m the Utah Jazz.@Traeshmaen @SanaDetroit @DetroitPistons This is the first Sana drop I would definitely get but I have to work and can't go 🥴@RoachOppressor @DetroitPistons @44Bojan @CadeCunningham_ @Dreamville_33 @IveyJaden 3. Weaver has nothing to do w/ this, I made several notes postgames that shit-Bey goes off when Jerami is out
4. Where do you think they Portland finishes?

1. That’s the same core we have and can flip Bog for more than we got for Jerami
2. He’s a solid role player, he’s not the main guy on a good team, and he’s not a shock-hating on Troy while he gave him a max to come here and be the GuyDetroit Pistons’ Young Guns Lead The Way In 2022 https://t.co/xWTV7upo96

Bojan really keeping us in it, feels so confident when he heaves it. We’ve got control of the boards and 3pt%. #Pistons@DetroitPistons @IveyJaden I want to see some straight up defense instead of the switch all that results in an open shot every single possession…@DetroitPistons @44Bojan @Dreamville_33 @IveyJaden @CadeCunningham_ can y’all tell saddiq and cade to t up fo my fantasy league please go pistonsNumber 7 on the Detroit Pistons

WATCH LIVE via 👉 https://t.co/CCoyKFfiezControversial Take: @IveyJaden will be better than @CadeCunningham_ when all is said &amp; done. We all know Cade will be great. I just think Ivey has a higher ceiling &amp; if he reaches it that's good for the whole team. Because it means @DetroitPistons have twp elite All-NBA players! https://t.co/weVFF1Og5QJaden Ivey with the crazy left-handed finish!!! 🤯

https://t.co/wkjZ5za0JR@DetroitPistons @IveyJaden Great...now have the team play defense (fyi, this is when your team doesn't have the ball).@DetroitPistons @IveyJaden ROTY I’ve seen enough@erictwigs @DetroitPistons @IveyJaden Just listen to all the interviews@theRealDCM @DetroitPistons @JalenDuren We can only hope. And, his defensive philosophy is ... Well, I don't think there is a defensive philosophy. Unless, leaving guys wide open under the basket AND at the 3 point line is a philosophy.@DetroitPistons @IveyJaden Forgot step 3: gets basketsThere are a lot of mediocre to good teams in the NBA. The Detroit Pistons are not one of those teams

They are bad and it is ok to admit it@DetroitPistons @IveyJaden Play some defenseGood energy pelicans continue to go in paint we got this lets go get murphey the ball @NBA @DetroitPistons #NBATwitter #NBATwitterLive@Hotubjonny @DetroitPistons @JalenDuren It’s bound to get him FIRED.@FreeMotorcadeee @DetroitPistons @HenryFordHealth Ok?

When have I seen this before, oh wait, EVERY game.I'm collecting the 1998-99 Fleer Brilliants Gold /99 set and Korleone Young was the 40th card I acquired in the chase. 🏀

Fun Fact: Drafted by Detroit Pistons out of high school and played 3 games (4.3 PPG) in one and only NBA season. https://t.co/wGRqCRoDpu@Blakeyflakes23 @DetroitPistons @HenryFordHealth You can be, but it just doesn’t make sense.Detroit Pistons are gonna be sneaky this year.Dude get killian Hayes off this team @DetroitPistons he’s absolute garbageStop putting Cory Joseph &amp; Killian Hayes on the floor PLEASE @DetroitPistons@DetroitPistons a backup backcourt of Hayes and Joseph is not gonna workDetroit Pistons Ram Ball Screen

Really love simple stuff like this...

When Isaiah Stewart dives and Bojan Bogdanovic exchanges to the top, you can just trust Cade Cunningham to either take the pull-up/drive or read the coverage https://t.co/1jLVdmjk2R@FreeMotorcadeee @DetroitPistons @HenryFordHealth I cant be glad hes not on the list?

It just doesn’t make it to the media. 

He clearly can’t make that mistake again, pistons would be in the clearI knew soon Stewart rookie year he was best off the bench. Also just filling the role until an improvement comes. He's a nice player, but too small, not enough bounce and doesn't space the floor well enough to start on a competitive team.
