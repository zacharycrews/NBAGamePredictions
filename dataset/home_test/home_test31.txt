@PGDynes Miami will be under water soon enough. Cities that face unrelenting heat and humidity with poor electrical grids and high poverty are extra vulnerable. Mississippi valley cities like New Orleans, Saint Louis could see mass deaths during a heat event without power.The MIAMI HEAT!@somiamiheat @MiamiHEAT It’s not the line up that sucks@NoahN2020 @MiamiHEAT No troll@MiamiHEAT still the same that line didnt work out alreadyWould love to see Spicy P score a triple double against Miami Heat tonight...

Miami hasn't started the season well, going 0-2 in their first two games both at home. Today they catch the Raptors who are on a back to back on the road. Very solid bounce back spot for Miami at home tonight.

#GamblingTwitter https://t.co/1wkyAk6WWF@MiamiHEAT @FTX_Official 2 straight games spo has lost the game with how he subs. Tyler has to play the start of the 4th not the last 5 minutes while he stays on the bench going ice cold.

There’s concerns. Some good, bad, ugly. I believe they’ll turn it around. 

But what I *have* loved is what I’ve seen from Tyler and Bam. 

Tyler is an all-star right now. And I’ve loved the *process* for Bam. 19/8/5 last night. Get him the ball.

But there have also been issues on the offensive end. Miami holds the NBA's seventh-worst offensive rating and is taking fifth-fewest 3s per 100 possessions.Check out this trade scenario I made on #Fanspo

@Lakers get:

- Heat overextend on smart corner 3 --&gt; brown open 3.
- Lowry getting 2 feet in the paint is really promising 
- Herro/Adebayo PNR working well
- Miami flashing help for  Tyler 1 on 1 possessions is really helpful.Celtics vs Heat game notes #HeatTwitter #miamiheat

( A thread)@MiamiHEAT Y’all better not disappoint https://t.co/LZIcr2x9Mj@stankylanky22 @sixers @MiamiHEAT Celtics ended both franchises sadlyLets tank for Victor Wembanyama @MiamiHEATthe miami heat play basketball today https://t.co/azsbFJ4noc@MiamiHEAT PJ Tucker was our difference maker his defense will be missed. Watch what he does for philly they will be on top because of him!! Miami did so well preseason with Jovic playing…spo needs to give him the starting position asapGame day. Hello. Raptors taking their talent to South Beach. Heat lost last night to BOS. Raptors need all hands on deck tonight. Historically Miami has run heavy doses of zone vs the Raps. Need that 3 ball tonight. Predicting a big game for Precious #WeTheNorth #rtz Pascal🔥Marcus with a "Tommy Hook" &amp; some "Bob Cousy Assists". Jay Team looking like men against boys. Much more from the Celtics defeat of the Miami Heat.

Can someone tell me what's going on this is already getting pretty sad were really gonna start the season.   0 and 2The #Heat clearly miss P.J Tucker &amp; need to adjust quickly.

Tyler Herro is awesome, but his transition to the starting 5 has created an awkward battle for touches on offense.

Overall, Miami can score, albeit in an imperfect system, while the defense has suffered greatly. https://t.co/Ci18VtVPVq@MiamiHEAT Waive Dedmon and trade Robinson🏀🏀Resultados NBA y mejores anotadores

When the Miami Heat start winning games and the Charlotte Hornets have their hashflag, I'll return to the NBA community base. Till then, I want nothing to do with basketball.The best and only hope now for the city of Miami is to relefect on why their beloved Heat lost 2 straight home games and take extra steps on how to start winning them this season.Tonight, the NBA community is going through a very tough time dealing with two things. One, the Miami Heat is 0-2 this season and they lost two straight home games. The other issue is, the Charlotte Hornets are the only team without a hashflag emoji this season.@Imman_Adan GBG tomorrow vs the Heat, gonna need a good start cause Miami 0-2 and mini pressure on them to get a W so I think if we get into a big lead in the gm can silent the crowd and apply bare pressure on em@grindlehoob @SamuraiZen4 @BobbyMarks42 How so? You want an example? PJ Tucker would not have left Miami to sign with Philly because the Heat would have had more cap space under this scenario. This would limit FA movement around the league.It also sucks that Oladipo is having issues with his left knee. Could’ve used 10-15 pts from him tonight. #MiamiHeat https://t.co/KbvUW9d3Ca@Fladdo_T @Undefined003 @AKukuaa @MiamiHEAT Whatever who cares. Past is past. Present is present.

The Heat's defense couldn't get to Boston's 3-point shooters, especially in the 2nd Quarter, but even worse was when they overcommitted and double-teamed without anyone grabbing rebounds.@Vizzy_rayven Miami heat do us dirty 😢😢😢😢@gadielcartagena @MiamiHEAT They can get literally anyone else@MiamiHEAT Next time, please play Jovic@MiamiHEAT 111 to 1-0-assI had a busy day but get y’all shit together @MiamiHEAT@MiamiHEAT Play JovicAs a die hard @MiamiHEAT fan:

Who’s going to cover the point that Tyler was bringing last year off the beachWhy do Miami fans dress as red seats whenever I watch a heat game? Very odd attire@MiamiHEAT Stop all the excuses. I won’t go as far as saying we suck, but we are way too inconsistent. When we score, we can’t make stops and vice versa. It’s too early to say we’re not a good team, but we’re heading in the wrong direction.@BagbakRegen @MiamiHEAT No I remember us pretty well winning a championship.

Bam - First game was a fluke, midrange is looking nice

Lowry - Played much more aggressive, needs to keep it up

Tyler - Disappeared in the 4th AGAIN

Gabe - Plays much better defense than I thought 

Jimmy - Defense was not great@MiamiHEAT Hard to win when our #1 can’t get 20Fucking @MiamiHEAT can we fucking defend and hit shots please! 0-2 on the fucking season@MiamiHEAT r we just cool wit Caleb Martin as our starting 4 or we gonna do somethin about it lmk thanks@chrisfpachec0 @MiamiHEAT It’s all in good fun haha, just a regular season game at the end of the day 😂@MiamiHEAT Trade Lowry or fraudWe’ll bounce back @MiamiHEAT@WadexFlash @MiamiHEAT Spo needs to play jovic or we need to trade for jae@Bam_Adobobayo @MiamiHEAT Oh I hope we don’t end up having a LONG seasonWhat a start to the season 🤦🏻‍♂️ #MiamiHeat@MiamiHEAT Shame on you guys playing dirty still lost 🤮@therealWiFye @MiamiHEAT Like trade for KD?

Reap what you sow 😵‍💫 also Riley didn't get LeBron Shaq or Jimmy. That's all Wade. The chip was Wade. Rileys Heat term= OVERRATED@WadexFlash @MiamiHEAT We have a PF, his name is Bam Adebayo.

Caleb is too small to play the 4.

Dedmon (when Yurt returns) &amp; Highsmith should not be in the roation.

SmhThe Celtics won 3 of 4 games in Miami in the ECF. They went into the FTX Arena in G7 and took a finals berth away from the Heat.

He's doing what he does every season, he gets hurt.  Hope nobody thought this year would be different.  The guy is injury prone.  Should have never paid him.

#miamiheat@MiamiHEAT Have to let the white boys shoot the 3..that's what got them deep in the playoffs..especially if the other guys aren't gonna play defense.  Riley has to be furiousthat was ugly never do that shit again @miamiheat@MiamiHEAT @betwayusa Running it back will put was way behind, we're too small and we need more better playersMiami heat awfully open to laughter-full conversation after getting smacked by BostonFinal: Celtics 111, Heat 104

Boston improves to 2-0; Miami falls to 0-2, with both losses at home.

Stellar games from Jaylen Brown and Jayson Tatum, who combined for 57 points. Tyler Herro led Miami with 25.

This team looks so much less tenacious on D. And not signing a replacement 4 is still such a head-scratcher… this team is in trouble, not hard to see it coming.@MiamiHEAT Update?We haven't won a game all season #miamiheatPlease bro trade Lowry @MiamiHEAT@Cherylafullert1 @Capecod89Das @Cmoon05 @onedaylight @HarryMannjr1 @mgend72 @mikewichter @raygodyes @coug88 @Missouri_Mimi @mrsceltics @Brimaried @smars319 @mardog38 @crystalfaye95 @NBAonTNT @celtics GREAT FINISH by our #Celtics!!!

Jaylen didn't even need to return to the floor. And your team doesn't even have fans 😂😂😂😂 just laughableCeltics clear the sad heat by miles unfortunately. Played that game at half effort and smoked their ass in front of a pathetic Miami crowd. 2-0 mazulla. On to the next. 🥱It’s all good. 80-2 for the Miami Heat! #HEATCultureJust tank @MiamiHEAT@MiamiHEAT bumsCeltics players are loving the "Let's Go Celtics" chant in Miami.

Tatum and Brown go for a combined 57 points tonight after combining for 70 against Philadelphia. 

Miami is now 0-2 after back-to-back home losses to CHI and now BOS.losing two games back to back isn’t crazy? at home????? @MiamiHEAT … y’all disgust me.Miami Heat really 0-2. 😭😭😭@MiamiHEAT Heat admin looking at the calendar for LGBTPZI month so they can distract from how awful this Spo-coached team is.Typical empty arena @MiamiHEATThe last time the Miami Heat started 0-2, George W. Bush was the President of the United States.No urgency by @MiamiHEAT at the end of this game. Lazy ballThis Miami Heat team is absolutely cooked. We’re counting on Tua Tagovailoa to save this cityMaybe next time @MiamiHEAT@OfficialNBARefs @celtics @MiamiHEAT @ESPNNBA Boston jersey game (Scott Foster) https://t.co/5cl0MpeNQQ@HeatvsHaters This Miami Heat team will need to earn my trust before I believe.  I'm not convinced.  For some reason, I'm looking at Spo.  What's your deal Erik.  Are you gonna toy with this team until you figure something out??????Not the type of start to the season the Miami Heat wanted smh. (0-2)@Fladdo_T @Undefined003 @AKukuaa @MiamiHEAT Only 17 but 😊@MiamiHEAT we gotta get this together ASAP!!! I know it's only the 2nd game but damn@MiamiHEAT we didn’t replace PJ and we’re letting Lowry bring us down further. Fix it.Sad loss for #miamiheat 

I think poor handling of basketball is a problem for the Heat.

Good win #Celtic 

#NBAOther than a couple of spurts in where Miami went on a run, a rather comfortable and solid performance from the Celtics. Tatum taking over and closing it out in such a composed manner. All of this without Time Lord being available. The Heat just don't look as dangerous anymore.@MiamiHEAT Just tank for wananabamama https://t.co/dQMPXUIGwUY’all gotta get big @MiamiHEAT@sebskiiiii @GoatBucketz7 @MiamiHEAT biscayne wembythe miami heat are a poverty franchise@MiamiHEAT start jovic or get a real pf BAM IS DYING ON THE BOARDSThe Miami Heat have lost 5 of their last 6 games at FTX Arena dating back to last season. 2 pretty miserable performances to start the season.

If you can’t beat them, you will lose in first round of playoffs.Yelling “Minutos” at a Heat game in Miami is on my bucket listRatioed in your own arena again. Pathetic fanbase. Shit team. Hold dat. @MiamiHEATthis game is gone #miamiheateat shit @MiamiHEATThis game was over when Bam got into foul trouble, Boston run followed. Until Yurtseven is healthy there's no help at the 5 #miamiheatKyle Lowry gotta go and so does Dedmon they both ass #miamiheat#Celtics manage 3/6 FG, 2 TOV offensively without Brown down the stretch and it looks like it'll just be enough. #heat will want a few bad shots back, but it looks like Boston did a good job luring them into them. Bam foul trouble in the 3rd ended up being huge. Miami bench bad.Trade the vets and tank for Wemby @MiamiHEATIf the @MiamiHEAT paired Bam with a 4 like KP or maybe even Sabonis they’d be favorites in the EastMiami Heat suck so bad it’s embarrassing.  Celtics own their shit.@MiamisOG @GoatBucketz7 @MiamiHEAT I retired 2nd quarter of last game time to tank maybe we get a top 5 pick@MiamiHEAT perhaps u should have actually made an offseason move 🤐🤢“let’s go #Celtics, let’s go #Celtics”

Giving me a headache over here.I said it after the first game and I'll say it again.  It's gonna be a long season for the Heat and Heat fans. They didn't get better and may be worse. I hope they give minutes to Nikola Jovic when he plays. Otherwise it's gonna be a tough year.

#miamiheat0-2 Miami Heat. 

We coming for VictorThe Miami Heat are not very good at scoring points. Last year they started the season very hot and then started struggling late. Hopefully it's the opposite this year.

I’m sure your aware there is a 6-10 / 6-11 rookie phenom 1st round pick that’s sitting on your bench. Do I need to ship the entire coaching staff new bi-focals???

#HeatCultureI’m tired of y’all already lol @MiamiHEAT@IraHeatBeat Hi Ira. Do the HEAT have a 1st round draft pick this year by chance? Seems to me like they are not going to amount to much this year from what I see. Maybe the Victor Wembenyana sweepstakes comes to Miami? #tankforvictorlol@HeatvsHaters Bro this isn’t Miami heat basketball. This is PAIN.Miami heat are ass 😂😂😂😂The Miami Heat give me depression@Ben_Cumberlidge @MiamiHEAT It’s been 2 years get over it lmaoBrogdon makes the Celtics so dangerous. What a pick up! Miami Heat hanging around but might get ran out the gym in the 4th quarter.New season same old Miami Heat struggling in half court offense situationsI forgot how much the Miami Heat piss me off 😔2 games in and I think my Miami Heat are Beta… 80 games left, but this is alarming.It's not pretty but the Celtics are matching the Heat's physicality, and Miami has no real answer for Tatum and Brown (and Brogden and Grant).

Miami actually came back and took the lead, but the Celtics led by 8 at the half and now leave by 12. I'll take itThe Miami heat is to smallI really hate seeing my team hold their hands up in disbelief after any offensive drive doesn't go their way @MiamiHEAT@MiamiHEAT Watching a HEAT game totally wasting timeRole players don't knpw their roles on this team #MiamiHeatWHERE ARE THE REBOUND HERMANOSSSS???

We can't shoot and can't play defense.  Man we better have dipo tomorrow or we're doomed@RodnyeTheoc @MiamiHEAT @betwayusa Yes that shooter's touch lol@MiamiHEAT @betwayusa wow what a surprise, a team starting Kyle Lowry Tyler Herro and Caleb Martin can’t defend@MiamiHEAT @betwayusa Herro a nice chase down block, most memorable defensive play by the Heat of the half. 

Lowry doing decent stuff on offense, but not any playmaknig for others.

Bam was on a tear with his jumper

Caleb WILL NOT MAKE IT as a PF

Jovic should be playing over some of these Gleaguers@MiamiHEAT @betwayusa Man we need a PF like JC yo, we need some fuckin dogs in this team@metal_splinter And somehow the Miami heat can’t seem to beat them 😂@MiamiHEAT @betwayusa Something is missing with this Heat team.@staypressedd @MiamiHEAT @betwayusa jimmy isn’t good@MiamiHEAT @betwayusa It's official. Your Miami Heat has been eliminated from the 2023 nba playoffs. Team is pure and utter display of trash vomit garbage pukeThere wasn’t a lot of defense played from the Heat, but there is still a lot of basketball left to be played.

Step it up and finish this first half strong Miami!😁@AProskauer @celtics @MiamiHEAT Brother a 360 dunk is when you spin in the air, during the jump. This dude did a spin move to get past a defender.

Black men never get that kind of love after making a mistake. ✊🏾❤ #BostonCeltics #ESPN #nbaonespn #miamiheatmiami heat so fucin boring@Undefined003 @AKukuaa @MiamiHEAT Our coach has 2 rings and is the best coach in the league. You are at home making $12/hr at McDonald’s. I’ll take his opinion and play style any day over yoursNaw these ain’t my Miami Heat@MiamiHEAT @CoachSpo Can we stop playing the entire lineup with 6'5" guys? Holy shit this is old as fuck.30-22, Celtics lead over the Miami Heat end Q1…in large thanks to Jaylen Brown, especially his 3 assists w/ knowing he’ll draw a 2nd defender #NBA @NBAThe Miami Heat never moved me, not 2020, 2021, 2022, and definitely not now

You can’t win a championship with Jimmy Butler as your #1@Undefined003 @AKukuaa @MiamiHEAT What happened to your fans? Empty Arena, quietLet’s keep the bigs out of foul trouble please @MiamiHEAT Let’s return the favor in the 2nd #MIAvsBOSBoston was already good enough to beat Miami last year. Guess which team made improvements versus which team stayed the same. I expect a respectable performance tonight and this season, but THIS Heat team isn’t winning anything worth mentioning.Miami Heat will face Toronto Raptors in a 2022/2023 NBA regular season game.

Five of Miami's misses (10 of 24) were blocked by Boston defenders (2 by D. White, 1 each by G. Williams, Vonleh and Brown).After 1 here in Miami: Celtics 30, Heat 22.

Boston already has five blocked shots, and closed the first on a 22-9 run with Bam Adebayo watching from the bench with two fouls.

Adebayo is back on the court to start the second quarter.@ThePharticusMax @LarryCo80239353 @MiamiHEAT Did you leave your fans at home?? This feels like a home game🤣🤣Watching this @MiamiHEAT vs @celtics and these offenses look really stagnant. Or I'm just use to watching @warriors basketball.we are very bad, i wasn't expecting nothing incredible from this season but man, we are very bad. #miamiheat@MiamiHEAT Maybe you should push some of that communist propaganda so no one notices just how we're gonna fail again on meeting expectations this year.Lol @MiamiHEAT y'all worse than the Lakers man all these Lyft drivers onna teamBoston should be blowing us out smh #miamiheat@MiamiHEAT make some trades please@MiamiHEAT what an awful first quarter we couldn’t figure anything out on offenseFinal do 1Q :

Miami Heat 22 x 30 Boston CelticsOur coach shows no heart or emotion and we are not playing with no effort! Bring in the rookies Jovic and Cain in we need a lift! Take out Duncan, Highsmith and whoever because our team looks like shit out there! @MiamiHEAT@chrisbitch93 The Miami heat got 7 personnel fouls Nd Boston Celtics 6 Fts already in the 1 quarter https://t.co/LJYTVdgwv1Not looking good as we close this 1st quarter. Boston’s length already giving us issues. 

Boston Celtics- 30
Miami Heat- 22

#HeatCulture@AKukuaa @MiamiHEAT Our genius coach loves playing mind games with him.Did the Heat and the Lakers talk in free agency? Miami looks small as well.  😭Feels like Boston didn't play as well as they possibly could have and yet they're up 8 after 1. Heat collapsed once Bam went out. The small lineup is killing them. Boston's getting tons of great looks and rebounding misses. Miami's guys can't get in the paint. Tough.I need Miami Heat to remember how to play basketballMiami Heat is going to have to make a trade for another star if they expect to compete for the top of the Eastern Conference.This Miami Heat roster is 🗑‼️‼️‼️@MiamiHEAT  this rotation is ludicrous1Q 🔚

Miami Heat 30-22 Boston Celtics.This season is gonna be similar to the season after the bubble for @MiamiHEAT but gonna enjoy no matter what and keep rocking for my Heat #heatlifer #letsgoHeat 🔥🔥🔥🔥Celtics 30, Heat 22 after one. Fouls: Miami 7-3. Heat also had three jumpers blocked in the quarter, which is suboptimal. 22-9 run by the Celtics in the last 6 minutes.And Highsmith ends it with a pointless setup away from a wide open 3 to a blocked 3.

MIAMI HEAT UNDRAFTED PLAYER BASKETBALLThe Miami Heat have maybe the worst home arena atmosphere in professional sports.We look ass get ya shit together @MiamiHEATThey done blocked u bums like fkn 5 times WTFFFF @MiamiHEATYeah this Miami Heat team ASS this year.End of first quarter: Celtics 30, Heat 22. Boston already with eight points off four Miami turnovers.Miami Heat vs Boston Celtics - Link 1 Live Stream
