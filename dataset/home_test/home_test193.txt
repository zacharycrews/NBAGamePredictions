This is not what I was expecting after the recent hot streak üòÉ Wizards defending wellOverall, this is a 22-2 run against Washington. One thing the wizards are doing to kill the Jazz offense is permanently parking whomever is guarding jarred Vanderbilt in the lane. And they haven‚Äôt reacted to jarred making a shot.

The key to tonight‚Äôs game: getting stops and running in transition. So far, Washington has done that, but the perimeter defense continues to be desired.
