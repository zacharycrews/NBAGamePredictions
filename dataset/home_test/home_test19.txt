Dejounte Murray looks to build off a successful season debut when the Atlanta Hawks host top overall pick Paolo Banchero and the Orlando Magic on Friday night....Atlanta Hawks

Trae + Dejounte both 20 pts 10 ast is interesting. 41 shots combined is a bit yikes, but if they get so many assists too... maybe ok? Dejounte assit overs?

7/25 on 3s is worrisome. 25 just not enough volume.

-16 rebounds is BAD, esp vs Houston. 15 oreb allowed?!@DogSurfRoadshow @KirkSeriousFace So you are supposed to b an insider and have connections and all this, on here bashing great podcasts for no reason, yet u can’t watch enough basketball to understand that the Atlanta hawks shouldn’t b in your top 10??  Man lolThe Atlanta Hawks are back in @StateFarmArena tonight looking to go (2-0) on the season as they face the Orlando Magic.

Following his 20 points &amp; 11 assists Hawks debut, @DejounteMurray is on the floor warming up.
