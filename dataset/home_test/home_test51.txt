He is not made for Championship teams, he needs freedom to make mistakes and it not be the end of the world.Great news fam! Washington Wizards sent me an email this morning asking my wife to sing for them this Friday!! Let’s goooooo!!! I’m getting the hang of this being a manager thing lol@Master420Bot @20shrugged @JCrossover Respectfully disagree, Russ was traded to the Wizards from Houston and averaged almost another triple double and had the young guys in Washington playing great just missing the playoffs. But I agree, he needs to be traded away from LeBron.1️⃣entrada #NBA
