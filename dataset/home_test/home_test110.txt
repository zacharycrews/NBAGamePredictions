But forcing that all the time doesn’t maximize his strengths. His handle is serviceable, but not great handle. He can &amp; should be one of the highest volume catch-and-shoot scorers in the league@chicagobulls Great pick up11/1/2022 #xman  @KDTrey5 + #NetsWorld  fire  age (48) @SteveNash on (26) yr mark of (1st) game 11/1/1996.

I’ve been screaming since last year that Zach does not get enough sets ran for him to get open off-ball. We saw more of it in the 4th quarter tonight &amp; good things happened. Gotta stop forcing Zach to be an isolation scorer.@chicagobulls @DeMar_DeRozan Super happy for yuta to actually get minutes. But derozan was sensational tonightFans chicago bulls https://t.co/yfegCBNQB9@chicagobullchat @chicagobulls That’s a non-issue. Zach is going to get hot some games, Demar will get hot others. DeMar is better off the dribble. I like the ball in his hands. Zach needs more screen action off-ball to set up catch &amp; shoot 3s &amp; be a slasher. He’s not someone you want dribbling around.@Raegan_Armani Definitely  is fun I use to attend games once,  every 3 months w when I worked in an arena  free food &amp; drinks  middle row to each game, golden state , Milwaukee Bucks  , Chicago Bulls@Trin82995529 @de_munsta @chicagobulls Yep they said the same thing in January and again at the draft.

We were told 6-8 weeks in January and he missed the rest of the year. Then he got a second secret procedure done after the season and now a third procedure in Sept. He was supposed to be back in 4-6 weeks and now we at week 6 with zero updates. Not good.@chicagobulls @ZachLaVine Zach in beast modeHIGHLIGHTS: Chicago Bulls finish strong against the Nets behind Zach LaVine's 29 points - https://t.co/4QF81EFsDH https://t.co/x0iwcOoUyW@chicagobulls That's the @ZachLaVine I know!LaVine has 20 in 4th, Bulls beat Nets. NEW YORK (AP) — Zach LaVine scored 20 of his 29 points in the fourth quarter, leading the Chicago Bulls to a 108-99 victory over Brooklyn on Tuesday night in the Nets' first game after a coaching change. The Nets https://t.co/brOi5Wltn0You just HAVE to watch for @DalenTerry 😂😂😂😂 best hype man ever #BullsNation  

The @chicagobulls have a gem https://t.co/3v4lB51KUE@ChicagoBob10 @de_munsta @chicagobulls I mean it will happen lmao cause his rehab is going well, it would be different if he doesn’t even touch the court but he will this season, coby is getting traded either way@to_jear Don’t own a deadfellaz, but they have partnered with wrangler, Chicago Bulls, and draftkings. Pretty impressive if you ask me@chicagobulls @ZachLaVine If only Lonzo could get healthy, we’d be a problem. Nice seeing Ayo step up, making the most out of it.@Trin82995529 @de_munsta @chicagobulls Yeah that’s not what I’m saying. Obviously Zo is better when fully healthy but will that ever happen? Given Zo’s contract maybe it’s time to move on. Especially when Ayo is a FA this summer and he’s gonna want long term starter money. Coby is tradable either way.Nets' Kevin Durant on Turnovers: 'Every Night I'm Guarded' by 5 Guy... (Bleacher Report)

Okay buddy lol@chicagobulls @dunkindonuts What a nice dunk@chicagobulls Bulls need a guy like Royce O'Neal tbh . Jae Crowder is him.@twelve1269 @FieldsSzn69 @chicagobulls Well he can't lol, he literally has butterfingers unless he's catching an oop.

When he’s cooking like this the Bulls offense is at its best. Smooth three level scorer who operates on momentum. 

🎥 @chicagobulls https://t.co/x4BfVwuhvj@twelve1269 @FieldsSzn69 @chicagobulls Stupid rule. If you're good enough now you should get run time now.@twelve1269 @FieldsSzn69 @chicagobulls I mean, you kinda can since Dalen has only been in the NBA for about 8 games lmao@CPL60631 @chicagobulls Cope https://t.co/ZLiNePXvxw@twelve1269 @FieldsSzn69 @chicagobulls Putting words in my mouth. I'm starting to think your a Billy Donovan burner account lol ain't no way you're this pressed about this...@smh24yt__ @FieldsSzn69 @chicagobulls We still need more time for Dalen to show he’s worth more minutes than what he’s getting.@smh24yt__ @FieldsSzn69 @chicagobulls You also can’t take these last 8 games as your sample to prove why Dalen needs minutes. This players have already showed us what they can do and that’s why they earned their minutes. Dalen hasn’t shown anything in his small time besides the fact he can foul &amp; play D.@NBAonTNT @ZachLaVine @chicagobulls @BrooklynNets fans be like: https://t.co/IV8XDm3CxL@shawnthomson2 @chicagobulls @MotorolaUS I don’t need him getting like 10-15 minutes every night, but I’d like to see him get some meaningful minutes. And yes you’re right, without Lonzo, the team isn’t close to top tier. With Lonzo and health elsewhere, they can be. But I want to see what Terry has.@chicagobulls Definitely, glad the rest of the league slept on em https://t.co/1cdsamGYjG@chicagobulls Tomorrow is now must win without Zach,or today means nothing.Losing to the Chicago Bulls and coming on twitta to talk shit to fans is wild.@EcoGal1 @MelAboveAll_ @chicagobulls @socios This destroyed droses knees, im ok@SilencedSofia @chicagobulls ABSOLUTELY NOT@smh24yt__ @FieldsSzn69 @chicagobulls Ok so you think a player needs to score to have an impact? DJJ brings a lot more to the table than scoring. Watch the games &amp; you’ll see why Dalen isn’t getting as much minutes. You don’t just sign someone for millions than give all their minutes to a rookie who hasn’t done shit@arturasfanclub @chicagobulls Scientists@AndreDrummond @chicagobulls @NikolaVucevic Needed you to play tonight bro@chicagobulls Just not against LoyolaI gave out 3 best bets in the #NBA on today’s episode of BUCKETS.

Should we just forget about him &amp; his contract because you think Dalen deserves more minutes? Dalen is nice bruh but he’s clearly not nice enough to take minutes away from players who solidified who they are. Something that doesn’t show in just 8 games.@DP0YLAVINE @chicagobulls @ChiSportUpdates There is a player currently on the Chicago Bulls who can play. 

That player is Ayo Dosunmu.@chicagobulls GoatMy Chicago bulls win tonight go bulls https://t.co/66Fgrh4yvv@chicagobulls @DeMar_DeRozan great win. need to be very consistent this year with playing like they did tonight. yet again see how much it means to have zach out there, hopefully he gets to play b2bs soon@chicagobulls I hate to say it but I Ayo vast improvement may make Coby White trade bait for another big or three and D guy. ✨🐂✨[NBA Highlights] Chicago Bulls vs Brooklyn Nets - Full Game Highlights | November 1, 2022 https://t.co/KeieFdTMZk@chicagobulls 2nd round 🤣🤣🤣🤣@arturasfanclub @chicagobulls Bro I hate uchicago bulls https://t.co/6CjrGdcJdW@FieldsSzn69 @smh24yt__ @chicagobulls You just love to argue huh?

While kyrie is 2-12 with 4 points lol@rad_who @chicagobulls We do need some playbook work ngl I mean we quite literally have a “ randomness play” where we just take one of our play and tweak it in the moment of the game and goran runs it well but it’s just odd.@smh24yt__ @FieldsSzn69 @chicagobulls I agree, only problem I have with Dalen is he looks like a scared kid out there. I don’t want him stepping on the court until he realizes just how much he brings to the table. Once he does he’ll be fine but until then I don’t mind him on the bench@chicagobulls win baby! Thank you for the 29pt game performance from my man @ZachLaVine #SeeRed #BullsNation https://t.co/gzktNrHDBp@LeProgressive @FieldsSzn69 @twelve1269 @chicagobulls Right bro tweakingpick up the phones @chicagobulls @warriors https://t.co/JiuS8p9Ivh@chicagobulls @BullsGirl182 Max player shit!@LeProgressive @twelve1269 @teddy_perkinss @chicagobulls He’s a great energy guy, but in no way should he be playing as much as he has, especially shouldn’t be playing more than Pat. He also shouldn’t be blocking our first round pick@chicagobulls ⚫️🔴 let’s go@chicagobullchat @chicagobulls No, the whole starting 5 are good options. Billy doesn’t run enough plays for the offense to run smoothly. We have Vuc a threat in the post. Demar in the mid, Zach wherever he wants. They run the same offensive set over and over@NBA @chicagobulls @BrooklynNets You let this man torch you like that? WOWAfter Steve Nash was dismissed as Nets head coach, Brooklyn lost 108-99 to the Chicago Bulls. Kyrie Irving scored four points. @Krisplashed 

https://t.co/yIz2HPKRGzBig 4th quarter win for the @chicagobulls! Bulls win 108-99 in Brooklyn led by 29 points from Zach LaVine. Dropped 20 pts in the 4th quarter alone! Strike while the irons hot.@FieldsSzn69 @twelve1269 @teddy_perkinss @chicagobulls Ngl you have the worst bulls takes. Javonte is big for the BullsAn eventful day for the Nets ends with a 108-99 loss to the Chicago Bulls. Zach LaVine's 22 points in the fourth quarter was too much for the Nets to handle as they drop to 2-6 on the season.

Yes.  Not askin for a rebuild, jus a retool@chicagobulls @socios These Bulls aren’t a championship team, even with Ball. The Bulls need to play their youth. Offensively they’re weak in the middle and wings. They’re weak defensively in the middle.  They need competition for spots.Tear this shit down again @chicagobullsMan, the Chicago Bulls are just hard to watch. They don't shoot well and they don't play much defense.

Not a great tactic to debunk when almost 1/2 is attacking tweet.
