I figured you would be a NY Knicks fan.Here's my thoughts on the Utah Jazz so far:

They could be the 2021 New York Knicks. Surprise everyone, play with heart, have a breakout star (Randle, Markannen). 

I don't know if that gets you a playoff seed in the west this year but it's gonna be a fun ride while it lasts.[UPDATE] Boston Celtics -4.0 (-4.5) at New York Knicks | Sat 19:40ET #BOSvsNYK #NBA ~ https://t.co/mr0uU0iXG3Not that anyone asked, but my Halloween costume this year was “New York Stevie Knicks”.
