Prior to last game, Okeke had knocked down 2+ threes in his L19/24 starts. Ayton has cleared this mark in his L6 v the Magic.

Even worse, Magic were missing a bunch of guys yesterday and Wiz were missing Beal AND Porzingis tonight (Wood was out for both). Big yikesBack to back losses to @WashWizards and @OrlandoMagicOrlando Magic “City Edition” https://t.co/Kz4mcIUtNjCrazy busy day but now it's time to see what Magic Twitter been talking bout.

WE💥G O T💥ALOT💥P O P P I N GIsaac is too much to ask but @OrlandoMagic  have plenty of rim protection that can guard the wing.  Grabbing a 3pt Shooter isn't as hard as it used to be either.  Those 2 make it interesting at least! https://t.co/4XgeBOGEaF@OrlandoMagic game was a vibe yesterday! Love being at the @AmwayCenter #MagicTogether https://t.co/78fYN0IIg5@Fanatics They need a new designer. That crap is ugly. The @OrlandoMagic could never bring new ideas. They all look the same@HoopMixOnly As GM of the @OrlandoMagic I’d offer 4 first round picks and every player except Fritz and PauloLuka lost that 30+ point games in a row streak to the Orlando Magic &amp; now looks like he forgot how to shoot the basketball. My god11/10/07 – Behind a career-high 8 3-pointers and 39 total pts (7r/6a), the Phoenix #Suns defeated the Magic 106-96, in Grant Hill's (14p/8r/3a - heavily boo'd) 1st trip back to Orlando after six injury-prone seasons (appeared in 200 of 492 games). Howard: 33p/18r. #WeAreTheValley https://t.co/JDXIa1yU1HThe @OrlandoMagic posted their new unis! I like them, but they didn’t include Isaac on picture day.
