Lmao. 🤡@KeithGrant09 @David_adams2 @dannykanell @joelklatt I can tell you why but Im sure you wont wanna hear it but the truth is anyone outside of Clemson hates Dabo. He runs his mouth, he acts like a fool on the sideline, people just don't like him. Plus a lot of ACC people want Miami or FSU back on top. And Ohio St gets heat, trust meAt dinner last night @DadShammdad and I decided that Miami needs to send Kyle Lowery and a 1st to the Jazz for Mike Conley. 

Sexton gets a great mentor, heat fix a glaring need, and Jazz will win less as kyle is washed AF.

Bless your heartStart UD tonight @MiamiHEAT https://t.co/5yTKASz6tV@PlayoffMiami @AltimaCrasher @HeatvsHaters @MiamiHEAT You are correct.While it’s no secret expansion teams usually struggle in their first few seasons, the Heat had clearly been dealt a difficult hand due to their location.

For instance, Miami’s closest divisional opponent was Houston, which was around 1,000 miles away. https://t.co/EaxNfTrYyHIn 1987 the NBA added four expansion teams; the Miami Heat, the Orlando Magic, the Charlotte Hornets, and the Minnesota Timberwolves.

The Heat began their first season in November of 1988, and they did so in the Western Conference. https://t.co/inWPusdkvRBefore the Miami Heat became an Eastern Conference powerhouse, they were the worst team in the West.

Here’s everything you need to know about their disastrous first and only season in the Western Conference and how they clawed their way out of it: https://t.co/ymqiTTtN7fWill Miami Heat be 2-2 or 1-3 today look at my likes section@MiamiHEAT @FTX_Official Again like Saturday@chuntgus @MiamiHEAT Funny how you didn't point to any stats that "prove otherwise."If I die, I want to invite the Miami Heat to my funeral so they can let me down one last time.@CanesWBB @AmyAudibert @MiamiHEAT Way to go Amy! @MiamiHEAT you made an incredible choice.An outstanding hire by @MiamiHEAT ! https://t.co/ZJjUTXnOuc🇺🇸🏀 Toronto Raptors at Miami Heat Live Stream &amp; Tips – Heat To Cover In Back-To-Back NBA Games

This aint like Shaq, Bron &amp; Butler who basically chose the sunny beaches of Miami as their S&amp;T destination.

If Miami was in the north, that "Heat Culture" would get exposed lolThis might be unrelated but why tf are the Raptors playing two straight games against the Heat with BOTH GAMES in Miami???

Typa scheduling is disHere are the financial implications for Caleb Martin, Nikola Jovic and the Miami Heat.

💰Martin: $44,683

💰Jovic: $15,448

In addition, the Heat will receive a tax variance credit of $22,341 (Martin) and $7,724 (Jovic).

The Heat were $162,830 below the luxury tax.@JLew1050 What about the 3 @MiamiHEAT players that came off the bench during the "altercation" @NBA ? Also, how could Koloko avoid "grabbing" Martin when trying to stand up as Martin stood over him with clenched fists? Koloko's T should be rescinded.No Caleb Martin, no Nikola Jovic for Miami on Monday. 

Koloko got fined $15k. Raptors outscored the Heat 50-31 after the ejections. https://t.co/4U3svV0Cmr@MiamiHEAT Martin is a thug. His parents should dig a hole and hide in there!
