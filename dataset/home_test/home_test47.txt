Drawing at 4:30 https://t.co/GKSXpgiGvh https://t.co/zM2ZVWW2mLI don't like the fact that the @HoustonRockets are 0 - 3,
I feel that the @utahjazz are going to go into these next thinking that it's going to be an easy matchup. We still have some things to fix before we can contend with some of the better teams in the league.
