#TakeNote@jazzmomm I don't know. I doubt either of them will ever be part of a championship team but we'll see. They did no better in the playoffs than the @utahjazz teams before with far less talent. Donovon is absolutely atrocious in the clutch, it will be interesting to see if that changes.personally i‚Äôm so torn between the lakers the timber wolves the warriors and the utah jazz@utahjazz Love this!

The Utah Jazz are clutch. Clutch is not to be underestimated. Clutch took the '21 Phoenix Suns to the NBA Finals. Maybe the Jazz are the '21 Suns.
6. Would love to see Agbaji and Fontecchio take Gay and THT's minutes.
3/#utahjazz #team49 Morning After:
1. Will Hardy is a mastermind. Putting Sexton in to close the game over starter Clarkson who was 6 of 9 from 3? Not many coaches do that, but it was absolutely the right move.
2. Sexton's joy warms my heart. His postgame is peak postgame.

He about to get worked by the new Jazz!@utahjazz GAURD GEORGE. Has 24 points. Maybe put someone on him@AbdullahRbc Looks like he is back, @utahjazz can‚Äôt quite pull away in this one.I know Danny Ainge the #1 Utah Jazz hater in the league. He did all this for Wemby or Scoot but they're winningUtah Jazz Mike Conley hit a layup with 4:49 left in the 2nd quarter it was the Jazz first field goal at the rim all night. 
10 of 20 from three keeping Jazz rolling.
20 of 32 shots have been three point shotsThe 3 best ball handlers / distributors on the Utah Jazz are

Mike Conley
Jordan Clarkson
Kelly Olynyk

The Jazz are at their best when at least 2 of those 3 are in the gameI know the season just started but why are the utah jazz so good, shit don‚Äôt even make sense ü§£This @utahjazz team. https://t.co/0ZMcKia8FXPaul George is doing literally whatever he wants against the Utah Jazz tonight.@blankslate2017 @utahjazz Never doubt Danny ainge's ability to weed out toxic@WorldWideWob The level of efficiency the @utahjazz are playing with to start the season has been impressive to say the least‚Ä¶ #TakeNote@MeganMcCuistion Turn on @utahjazz game instead! üòÜ We‚Äôre up 4.@chardurd @JordanClarksons The most rewarding part this this opening chunk of  @utahjazz's season is seeing this side of @JordanClarksons...My least favorite Utah Jazz joke. Combining Gay and Sextons last names. 
The reason? It just continues to reinforce the gay = gross garbage that permeates sports in particular, even worse so in Utah.  We get it, gay people make you uncomfortable. You‚Äôre now embarrassing yourself.Terrance Mann always shows up for Utah JazzJordan Clarkson is on fire tonight! He has been playing so amazing, and is so fun to watch! I am loving this new team of ours!

#TankNotLe match de Paul george #ClipperNation vs #utahjazz @KevinNocera13I really think Rudy Gay could help a top-heavy contender as like an 8th or 9th guy

He just doesn‚Äôt makes sense on this Utah Jazz team@utahjazz I think Lauri has found a home in Utah. He played at Arizona in college so it‚Äôs his part of the country. He just wasn‚Äôt a good fit in Chicago or apparently Cleveland either. His game can flourish out there. He‚Äôs my guy so I just want him to be where he can succeed.Still doing 3 pushups for every Jazz 3 pointer. Whos with me? #utahjazz #takenote #pura3pointer #lesolsonitThis is the best shooting team in Utah Jazz historyJust your typical Utah Jazz game timeline lol

#UTAvsLACUtah Jazz have started off by making 5 of their first 7 shots, with 4 of them being 3s. Clippers have also made 5 of their first 7 shots, but they've attempted zero 3s. Marcus Morris Sr. leads the Clippers with 6 points as the Jazz hold a 16-10 advantage.The Utah Jazz are 4/5 from three to start the game. They've only made one two pointer, everything else has been threes. Some really hot shooting.The Lakers are back at it on Monday against the same Utah Jazz team that ran them off their home floor three days ago. Can they exact revenge in Utah on the end of a back-to-back?  @LakersSBN https://t.co/hhkkObaZwBThis Utah Jazz team can SHOOT

#TakeNoteThe Utah Jazz miss Vanderbilt something serious on the defensive end. Guy has made a big impact already this season .
