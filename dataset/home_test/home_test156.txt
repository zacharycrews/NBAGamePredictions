Everyone was predicting them to be one of the worst teams in the leagueRussell Westbrook is heating up, and the rest of the Lakers team is hungry for revenge. Just like I have said before, it is very difficult to win a game against the same team twice in a row. Either way, the Utah Jazz are just getting better and better.

With Lebron just ruled out and Lonnie Walker + Beverley missing too, the Lakers are lacking a regular starting 5 and I feel the Jazz will have too much for them.

The Utah Jazz will make the playoffs this year. https://t.co/hRFZqx43NEI am a @utahjazz and @matthewmtemple fan now. #TakeNote https://t.co/5b28NYOGNdseriously, what's going on with the Utah Jazz? 🧐5. The Utah Jazz are clutch. Clutch is not to be underestimated. Clutch took the '21 Phoenix Suns to the NBA Finals. Maybe the Jazz are the '21 Suns.
6. Would love to see Agbaji and Fontecchio take Gay and THT's minutes.
3/#utahjazz #team49 Morning After:
1. Will Hardy is a mastermind. Putting Sexton in to close the game over starter Clarkson who was 6 of 9 from 3? Not many coaches do that, but it was absolutely the right move.
2. Sexton's joy warms my heart. His postgame is peak postgame.

Lauri Markkanen’s defense on Paul George.

PG13 was killing the Jazz most of the 1st half. Lauri picked him up and PG13 slowed way down the rest of the game.

There's a reason Utah is the best clutch team in the NBA — and it showed over the final five minutes. The @utahjazz never panicked, ending the game on an 18-6 run to get the 110-102 victory over the @LAClippers on Sunday night

And shout out to the @utahjazz team@utahjazz @sportsiren @lhmauto You guys should be tanking, but I’m surprised 

Sexton has always been a starUtah Jazz still built a better roster despite trading their star player and a legit scorer and Jeanie Buss btw extended a guy who talks like butter on the outside with all the lies to the fans and built a inconsistent bad roster all around. Positively shocking.I didn’t watch the Clippers Jazz game but a couple things

1. The Utah Jazz are really really good… a bunch of good players that will have great trade value

2. John shoots free throws like DeAndre Jordan now… pathetic@utahjazz @sportsiren @lhmauto Amazing young man.@NBA @utahjazz Jazz my favorite team😅PG13 dropped 34 points and still caught hands.

Which of course, is a perfectly logical emotion, considering I’ve had absolutely nothing to do with their success and haven’t even met most of them in person.

Getting to the paint makes a difference!If you take away the logo on the jersey, the names on the back of the jerseys, and the expectations you had coming into the year for the Utah Jazz, is their resume so far that of a contender? If not, it’s frankly extremely close. They’ve just been checking box after box…Utah Jazz = 12-13 Nuggets ?@LacPeachbasket The Utah Jazz somehow are beating everyone - including a bunch of these on the road.  7 road games only 4 home games.@utahjazz First time watching this team 🔥 Legit 🔥Gone streaking! 😤 The Utah Jazz bank on a fourth quarter run to take down the LA Clippers in their own hometown!

Weekly Recap in the AM…Good Night Twitter 🕺🏻The Clippers will have their three-game winning streak snapped by the Utah Jazz. They played well but it was a tough game with incredibly bad calls, and too many missed three-pointers.@NBA Very disappointed with the officiating in tonight’s @LAClippers vs @utahjazz game. Many incorrect callsHey, another win for the @utahjazz  #TakeNote # 🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕the haters@utahjazz @CollinSexton02 Raging BullUnderestimate that Utah Jazz team at your own peril ⛏️⛏️there are good hoppers in there⛹🏾‍♀️⛹🏾‍♀️🔥🔥🔥@utahjazz @SexIandCAVS @CollinSexton02 i agree go cavsThe @utahjazz lead by 6 with under a minute remaining!

Can the @LAClippers get back into it?

#NBATwitterLIVEAlright it’s not funny no more , why are the Utah jazz beating everyone ?My brain can’t comprehend the Utah Jazz being goodThat's nine fourth quarter points from Collin Sexton who has taken this game over when the @utahjazz couldn't find any offense in the second half. 

The Jazz lead the @LAClippers 108-102 with 54 seconds to play.

https://t.co/U52zE6iqQNSexton’s intensity scares me… in a good way? I think? #TakeNote #nba #utahjazzThough the season is still early, the Utah Jazz are defying the odds after trading allstars Donovan Mitchell and Rudy GobertThe Utah Jazz are unbeatable sadlyCollin Sexton is the difference in this game. #UtahJazz #TakeNoteThe Utah Jazz blew up their team and still look better than my Knicks, bro. https://t.co/nHIvWvNcBhTimeout 104 - 98 Utah Jazz👏👏👏Utah Jazz really have a lot of good players man. They can cause a lot of problems for a defense.

They was sleeping on you, thinking it was time to tank @utahjazz@trevor_porath @utahjazz No way, although Don is amazing, his accuracy numbers are horribleI don’t understand the Utah Jazz… They traded their 3 best players, but that coach has them playing free and having them believe in themselves. Did not expect them to be 7-3@trevor_porath @utahjazz Not a chance. But also, total numbers next to #1 total minutes isnt overly impressiveMike Conley x Jordan Clarkson x Jarred Vanderbilt x Kelly Olynyk x Lauri Markkanen

This Utah Jazz starting 5 can compete w anyone this season.

They work perfect together.

He just doesn’t makes sense on this Utah Jazz team@utahjazz I think Lauri has found a home in Utah. He played at Arizona in college so it’s his part of the country. He just wasn’t a good fit in Chicago or apparently Cleveland either. His game can flourish out there. He’s my guy so I just want him to be where he can succeed.Still doing 3 pushups for every Jazz 3 pointer.

Marcus Morris Sr. leads the Clippers with 6 points as the Jazz hold a 16-10 advantage.The Utah Jazz are 4/5 from three to start the game. They've only made one two pointer, everything else has been threes. Some really hot shooting.The Lakers are back at it on Monday against the same Utah Jazz team that ran them off their home floor three days ago. Can they exact revenge in Utah on the end of a back-to-back?  @LakersSBN https://t.co/hhkkObaZwBThis Utah Jazz team can SHOOT
