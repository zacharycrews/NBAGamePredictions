Weren’t some of the Bones minted supposed to be used for marketing, where are all the “marketing” funds being spent exactly? I realize a portion of newly minted Bones were also allocated to OG admins pay, admins pay, development, etc but where is the marketing? https://t.co/EwRznWtSlo@MiamiHEAT It’s always been a mistake to get involved in the world of cryptocurrency in any way . It has been proven time and again . Sports /athletes have tried to promote it as something good for too long not wanting to face the consequences. Now , hopefully, people will see theTyus Jones has just announced on his own instagram that he has signed a 4-year extension with Miami Heat.@CometCalls @WatcherGuru That doesn’t make any sense.

Given the unfortunate events with FTX and @MiamiHEAT terminating the naming rights, it would be really cool if the arena would be called @Bagnersnft arena.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,
