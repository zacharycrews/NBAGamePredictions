https://t.co/7rmaZfz9O2@JimMWeber I worked “in the truck” for three seasons for Hartford Whalers hockey and Boston Celtics basketball (SportsChannel New England) from 91-93.
Before every game the cameramen would play a game of how many hot chicks they could spot in the stands. This is common practice for them.@statmuse Good lord it’s 5 games in, the answer to “is it too early” in October is ALWAYS yes. See Boston Celtics 2021-2022 for an extremely recent example.
