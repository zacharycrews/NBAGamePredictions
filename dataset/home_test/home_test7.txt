It’s 82 games and I feel like we have enough ball handlers so he won’t be missed that much. I do hope we get to see him flourish this season. Good closerSeason 35 starts tonight @MiamiHEAT 🔥🔥🔥

I will be following every game and will be reacting accordingly. However, if this team starts to play bad and bore me, I will likely jump ship and follow another team. Go Heat!Tonight, the Miami Heat, led by Adebayo, Butler, and Herro, will take the Chicago Bulls to the slaughterhouse. Easiest 1-0 start ever!🚨Miami Heat Pregame Show 🚨

Good luck to @MiamiHEAT this season! 🔥 https://t.co/yIaBSb7rzl@MiamiHEAT we can fix him? https://t.co/mooYIf2PgkFINAL THOUGHTS 💭👇🏼

I think The Heat players and coach have too much chemistry to come out and lose at home on opening night to a short handed Bulls team that will struggle to score - Miami will control the tempo which they may increase, but I don’t expect it early. GOODLUCK!🔒Last season, the #MiamiHeat ranked 4th last in possessions per game which means they play at a slower pace (Chicago ranked 16th) 

I expect them to win - therefore I expect them to dictate the pace of the game which will result in #ChicagoBulls limited possessions as well.@avlev124 I am a @MiamiHEAT fan #HEATLifer if that helps@MiamiHEAT The goat is in the building@MiamiHEAT @FTX_Official Ready for a solid regular season and an early playoff exit?

Check it out before the season opens up tonight! @BleavNetwork @BleavSportsThe Miami Heat play basketball today, but Man Utd attempt to play football today https://t.co/2pLWj2wjWCMiami Heat. We’ll be 4-6 this year in the East. Riley still stubborn and Heat culture is tough so is hard to entice free agents. Bam has to step his game up. Biker a no.2 option but has to be the 1.

He will be hurt all season . Heat need to pick up somebodyThe Miami Heat play basketball tonight https://t.co/WchOVGBgFSThe @MiamiHEAT Play Basketball Tonight 🔥‼️Chicago Bulls ranks 30th opp. corner 3 % (41.8) and Miami Heat ranks 4th corner 3 % (41.1). So the Bulls have to stop or close out the corner 3 rather than swarm at the paint.Miami Heat ranks 28th turnovers (14.6) and 28th pace (96.53). So it's important to get in the passing lane and use the double-team in the half-court defense. Turnovers lead to the fast-break points.👀 🔴 It’s gameday… for real real. @chicagobulls are back tonight against @MiamiHEAT! #BullsNation #HeatCulture #NBATipOff #NBA #NBATwitter@MiamiHEAT home opener tonight!

Very disappointed with the support.@uncle_greyy They will beat Miami Heat and Chicago Bulls not forgetting Philadelphia 76xersI haven’t read up on it enough - but I will say this - golden state needs DG - they don’t have anyone else that can bring that spark - GREEN brings something others can’t - he’s still the gel to that team.

Miami-Dade could see the sharpest increase in the nation of dangerously hot days over the next 30 years. The findings mirror previous studies projecting extreme heat in South Florida, including Miami-Dade’s heat vulnerability report. @opportunitymiaMiami: I didn’t like the Heat off-season at all…lose PJ Tucker and don’t replace him. Who plays the 4? Maybe Jae Crowder? Only logical route for improvement there…Jimmy Butler won’t be playoff Jimmy the entire season…Lowry’s old ass is even older.
