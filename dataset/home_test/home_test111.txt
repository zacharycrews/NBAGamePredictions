I blame the fans too. The FO probably makes Lue keep them in a lot too just cuz they both can get hot on the 3. Reggie is inconsistent af and plays little to no D and Mook the same.@HoustonRockets What’s our obsession with messing up a perfectly normal hotdog lol@HoopsPadawan @OwnedByCian @LAClippers @HoustonRockets @BallySportWest @AM570LASports @TuLigaRadio He won't, his love for Reggie is blinding and self inflicting. He doesn't hold them accountable, still play iso, chuck up 3s, no back up big, small ball line up is not working,@DendeIsMe @billoquacious @HoustonRockets LETS GOOOO 🔥🔥@anayvli @billoquacious @HoustonRockets Thank you!!@DendeIsMe @billoquacious @HoustonRockets AHHH good luck dende &amp; billy🤎🤎!!I think many can understand that the Houston #Rockets need to win tonight at home against the Clippers in more ways then one.

https://t.co/iT5IT3UkUE@BiasedHouston OK, that's fair. But at that level isn't Houston Rockets basketball using their super athletic backcourt to create advantages for the team and building off that? 

 Now, saying that does not mean they're always successful at doing that (or even that they consistently apply it).@marioelie1 @LAClippers @HoustonRockets @CalvinMurphyHOF @KevinEsch1 @ATTSportsNetSW Question if Paul George is going off again tonight would you trap him and get the ball out of his hands?@ATTSportsNetSW @SportsVanessa @memorialhermann @HoustonRockets Astros are on tonight#Rockets vs Clippers TONIGHT on AT&amp;T SportsNet

CWood said this before he left. We can both be the face of the franchise. Green has one thing on his mind. It will cause a clash. #Rockets@FitzyGFY I get that the @celtics have zero leverage, but I don’t understand why they would let #ImeUdoka go to a conference rival with no compensation? 
This is not the @HoustonRockets or @SacramentoKings, but the @BrooklynNets?

Read and react is what we run with Silas, but it doesn't work with this roster. My pick for a good coach is actually Brett Brown. He keeps all his players accountable and develops.The Houston Rockets P.J. Tucker had 69 points 24 rebounds.#Rockets @HoustonRockets 
This is my take on coaching. Silas is a good personality for these players. However, his ideology best suits a more developed team with experience. That doesn't mean he's terrible, but we need a coach who specializes in development.@BradeauxNBA Y’all are some fake Astros fans man my god good riddance have y’all forgot he clutched game 7?
