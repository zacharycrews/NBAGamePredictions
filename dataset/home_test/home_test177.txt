Ask me, what community? @killabearsnft https://t.co/4DhQlTOhX2@rudewood5 @NBA_NewYork Yea the Bulls were deadly throughout the entire 90s, but John Starks was a huge reason the Knicks even made playoffs or got a close as they did back then too though.

In the finals, we have an interesting battle. Pelicans three better starters, while I got two better starters. 2v5 is a hard challenge.

Unfortunately the New York area will ALWAYS be Knicks nation.Here’s a wild idea that might actually work: the next president of the New York Knicks should be… Jeff Van Gundy.

- He knows what we need on this team and I’m sure he won’t be afraid to do what it takes to make it a reality plus he has an great basketball mind and has NY ties.@KimKardashian Without trying to be weird, unoriginal, or cliche we should go to the basketball game on December 3rd, in New York. The Knicks play the Mavericks. Then we could go ice skating afterwards and see the Christmas tree 🎄 It'll be a good game. Are you in? @kardashianshulu@NBA_NewYork This is a bad look.  I hope Leon makes some changes, also this looks bad on Thibs as well. #KnicksRonnie Fieg of KITH has been named the first ever Creative Director of the New York Knicks 🏀 https://t.co/vIVDviOJ5U@TheNBACentral @sam_amick Oh my god guys did you know that the Knicks tried to get Donovan Mitchell?? Former Utah Jazz player Donovan Mitchell might have been a New York Knick! He’s not on the Knicks but he could have! He plays for the Cavs but the Knicks tried to trade for him! DID YOU KNOW THAT????@NBA_NewYork I have a hard time seeing him talking about this Knicks here. No way Thibs letting dudes get away with that lol@NBA_NewYork That toxic crap shouldn’t be in the Knicks locker room.. bunch of grown men behaving like boys looking for contrived motivations… nah man, tell me now so I don’t have to put one ounce of hope into this heartbreaking franchise anymore #Knicks @IQ_GodSon @obitoppin1 @J30_RANDLEBet NBA 🏀🇺🇲

They have good wings and a true center. A guy who can switch off between scoring and passing as equally well as Shai can benefit a team like the Knicks.
