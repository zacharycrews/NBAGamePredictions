He's doing a great job, the team is better with him as head coachThere is only one "best bet" for #Knicks-#Nets tonight on ESPN: Brooklyn fans will be outnumbered. As for Kyrie, my take is different, and is in this column, along with interesting wagering info related to tonight's game: https://t.co/2tUzEG6rwsNick Cannon: Brooklyn Net's 'buck breaking' six-step course for Kyrie Irving redemption is 'dehumanizing'

There's always something in the way of our goals.The Brooklyn Nets have named Jacque Vaughn as their head coach, the team announced. https://t.co/n08wK9Tasu@BrooklynNets This is a PR decision 💯@StopAntisemites @amazon @JeffBezos @amazon_policy @AppleBooks @BrooklynNets @KyrieIrving Jews and supporters need to speak out more@BrooklynNets KD as soon as a decent trade opportunity pops up https://t.co/16JMIRgzjc@BrooklynNets This franchise is done 🚮@BrooklynNets no I don't accept thisToday is a good day to remind @KDTrey5 ain’t nothing cool about being a Brooklyn Net, especially this season.Brooklyn Nets to remove interim label from Jacque Vaughn, officially make him head coach https://t.co/2o2Cr6i8sH https://t.co/bCfouSZFuQ@ItBegins2012 @BrooklynNets The way I understand it KD and Kyrie wanted Atkinson fired and asked to hire Nash. Then KD threw him under the bus. I may be wrong but that’s what I remember hearing.@BrooklynNets Ime got done dirty. 

The job was his and they took it away due to media pressure.@BrooklynNets I love how everyone thinks this is doomsday. Don't judge a book by it's cover or by it's past. The recent 3 games have been a fresh eye opener and JV is doing things Nash would never do.  As much as I'd like Ime for track record, this is working out pretty well so far.The Brooklyn Nets have made Jacque Vaughn their head coach, promoting Steve Nash’s replacement instead of hiring suspended Boston coach Ime Udoka. Vaughn has gone 2-2 as acting coach since https://t.co/2UW4XQgPR5@hypermetsfan @BrooklynNets Atkinson wasn’t good either. And Sean marks picked the head coachBrooklyn Nets pass on Ime Udoka and name interim Jacque Vaughn as full-time head coach https://t.co/DdbBEjjicM via @BostonGlobe@ItBegins2012 @BrooklynNets Just curious. Who picked Steve Nash as coach?  Isn’t he the reason why Atkinson was fired?Do that and you'll be good. If it's close, do not play "The Statue" Royce. Everybody else is playing their heart out to keep their roster spot. Go with the dogs (KD, Ky if available (or Patty), Nic, Ben and Cam). That's your best line-up. GO! @KDTrey5 @BrooklynNets @joetsai1999@lovelime29 @BrooklynNets @NBA He promoted antisemitism to his millions of followers.

@LockedOnNets @DougNorrie @BrooklynNets@ItBegins2012 @BrooklynNets Kyrie may never play again. He’s too dopey to realize when he did. He is finished. As for Durant…what has he done for Brooklyn?  I never wanted those 2 bozos on this team. Now that we have them we will be mired in mediocracy.The PG and SG that's in when Jalen is in should pick him up from the logo and hit him with constant double teams. Don't let him get going. Troll him with trash talk, draw the charge and foul him. Keep his rhythm off and never let him get warm. @KDTrey5 @BrooklynNets @joetsai1999The @BrooklynNets are a disgrace.

I'm talking about who you see Nick Cannon with in the video😎3 reasons why Brooklyn Nets opted out of Ime Udoka as head coach https://t.co/nvOBARQI9X #NBA #BasketballThe Nets pivoted from Ime Udoka to Jacque Vaughn as their next head coach amid backlash and reported doubts of their ability to contend.

Why the hiring is a likely indicator of big changes on the horizon in Brooklyn. https://t.co/OBGGlLCTbXTonight is the battle for NYC! "No Easy Buckets" in the arc.. that's lion feeding zone. KD and Julius will battle. I got KD winning that. Ben and Nic need to lock RJ up since Yuta is out. I wouldn't trust The Statue Royce with that assignment. @KDTrey5 @BrooklynNets @joetsai1999@KyrieIrving , man has a right to his opinion, I might disagree with it, but it's his right to have. The list the @BrooklynNets have made up is crap meant to humiliate, that's all. I'm white, I'm older, and can tell you from experience that isn't the way to reach someone.@collado04 @JonnyNBlack @BrooklynNets We've seen him coach 1 year and that team is looking just as good without him.

He’s very knowledgeable &amp; his players like and respect him. It’s just a shame that his job will be more babysitting than it will be coaching.

@NBA@NBA @nyknicks @BrooklynNets @Lakers @LAClippers Time difference is poop 💩 for us in the UK 🇬🇧They were spotted at a Brooklyn Nets basketball game in April of this year

It would be recalled that earlier this year, Melinda told CBS Mornings Gayle King that she was dating again, 'dipping her toe' back into the world of romance and definitely' open to finding love again@macexmets @EManningHOF @alex93899882 @BrooklynNets Why would you spend millions on a coach that likely ain’t winning you a chip who you don’t even know what happened in their case, when it’ll likely cost you even lower attendance/ratings?My honest theory on the Brooklyn Nets: 

Kevin Durant plays better WITHOUT Kyrie Irving because he knows Kyrie has a high touch-to-shot ratio. So, when Kyrie is out there, KD feels more obligated to "get his" when the ball is in his hands. Shares more w/role players.

Interesting challenge.@BrooklynNets I lowkey feel bad for y’all at this pointI thought the Phoenix Suns was the most chaotic runned franchise today... until the Brooklyn Nets took over that reign... Problems come not only from the owner, but from almost everyone else in the FO and several players due to ego.🚨BREAKING NEWS🚨

That's what he is guilty of. TSAI of totalitarian China which has a horrendous human rights record wants to punish him.where’s Jay Z’s influence with the Brooklyn Nets, while the “Untouchables” are literally buck breaking Kyrie Irving right now???@PartridgeLady @SInow @ShannonSharpe @undisputed @KyrieIrving @DerrickNAACP @kanyewest @BrooklynNets @TheRevAl @KingJames @Nike @MikeConti929 Yeah. I see what you mean. I'm not alright with them either. I am with you in hoping for a balanced media. Right now, it's just way too biased.@BrooklynNets Nets don't seem to know their _____ from a _____ in the ground. Hire Jerry West to fix your inertia and paralysis.

Or the fact that he hasn't been able to get back to the Finals since leaving the team that never needed him to win? Or the fact that he just got swept by the Celtics lol? Or the fact when he couldn't get his way in Brooklyn, he wanted to be traded to a contender?🤔I'm not sure why, but I have a feeling Kyrie is going to announce his retirement in the next 24-hours. Zero evidence, it's just too quiet, and the @BrooklynNets volcano must be smoking again by now, ready for another eruption@nba / Brooklyn Nets  mad they gotta pay Kyrie Irving back pay for them he missed for not getting that shot 🤣😂🤣 stay woke I mean vaccinated well y’all know what I mean 😂🤣😂@Kingofthegist @BrooklynNets @joetsai1999 @KDTrey5 @DukeMBB You mean how LeBron's last championship in 2020 only he and AD were all stars on the Lakers? That counts as a Superteam to you? Remember when immediately after that KD went out of his way to recruit Harden, Aldridge and Griffith to form another Superteam after just leavingDon Buchwald's Net Worth

He’s already acknowledged it! It’s going to far on him with all the stuff he asked to do. What about Amazon?  What about these 2 White Radio guys promoting the Civil War, &amp; Gone with the Wind? @mikeconti929@marvingarbeh @KDTrey5 @YESNetwork @BrooklynNets The DRAMA continues, wish they would get PJ Tucker tho.@PartridgeLady @SInow @ShannonSharpe @undisputed @KyrieIrving @DerrickNAACP @kanyewest @BrooklynNets @TheRevAl @KingJames @Nike Yeah. Although I don't agree with Kyrie's views, I do agree with you that he was used to cover up the Brett Favre issue. No one talks about Brett. But Kyrie, he's still talk of the town!@RealJayWilliams @shaunking Seeing Adam Silver @NBA promoting a known genocide perpetrator @PaulKagame who serves the West, who’s killed 6M folks in #Congo tells me Silver, @joetsai1999, @SeanMarksNetsGM, @BrooklynNets are buck breaking @KyrieIrving. They clearly ain’t SENSITIVE to genocide of 6M blacks. https://t.co/RddlVkpALkThe Brooklyn Nets laid out a six-step plan for Kyrie Irving to return to the team after he was suspended for being unapologetic regarding a tweet of a link to an Amazon film that shared antisemitic disinformation. TV # # # # # # # # # #
