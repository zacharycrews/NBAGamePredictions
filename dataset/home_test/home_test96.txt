There‚Äôs no way Delon Wright (in his first season with Washington) being out with an injury was the end all be all for the Wizards defense .@Tips4Street I was even surprised o, even Washington wizards couldn‚Äôt score over 100 points.

https://t.co/Cgw26a9t8i@mrvincecarter15 is my favorite basketball player ever, and I was supposed to go to his last game ever in Washington vs the Wizards but it just didn‚Äôt work out and that will for be one of my regrets.The #Celtics‚Äô 112-94 win against the Washington #Wizards at TD Garden on Sunday was reminiscent of the second half of last season, when Boston relied on its defense, poured in timely 3-pointers, and needed little time to turn close games into romps. https://t.co/wCGJzL3ArK#NBA Final Score

Boston made 21 of its 47 3-point attempts, and from Washington's perspective, far too many of those looks were open shots or shots contested too late.

Pre-season game?
Why such a dirty game?
Why isn't Washington playing?Make it make sense. Beal been off all night, he makes his first FG and the coach subs him. Let him get in rhythm... #washingtonwizards #nbaprops https://t.co/MPm0BplLdBNothing will fix your season quite like a Sunday afternoon matchup against the Washington WizardsBeal breaks out of an 0/11 start. He's killed Washington here with his teammates mostly keeping the #Wizards within striking distance.@KDTrey5 When you coming to Washington to help out the Wizards??If I were the GM of the Washington Wizards, I would trade for Sharife Cooper with all due respect.14 ORs for Washington now.

This is helped by the Wizards shooting 34%, but the Celtics just can't control the glass.

Robert Williams will help, but he's not a dominant individual rebounder. The team-wide effort has to be better. https://t.co/g92mJXxvU9NBA Live Stream HD #DubNation¬†¬† #WarriorsGround #DCAboveAll¬†¬† #NEBHInjuryReport #BleedGreen¬†¬†

Celtics jumped ahead, 34-15, through 1, then the Wizards outscored them, 28-19, in 2Q. Celtics got a bit too comfortable, and the Wizards made them pay.

Brown 21, Tatum 18, Porzingis 13. Beal still scoreless. Washington shooting just 36.5 percent.Halftime: Celtics up 58-47 on the Wizards. Washington went on a 20-7 run to end the half.
