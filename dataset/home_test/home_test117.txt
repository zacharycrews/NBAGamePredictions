#NBA 

Warriors -9 (-112) vs Magic
2 units

This is the end of the Warriors’ 4-game road trip after they lost the previous 3. Orlando will be without 2 or 3 guards in their backcourt and GSW won’t lose all 4 games on this trip, definitely not against this Magic lineupNot much going on today.

I like GSW -9. Orlando isn't good, Warriors are struggling but should use this game to get right. I feel a blowout

Could you please cease and desist with this flagrant disregard for the player's health? Why wait for 3 years for injury rehab, when 4 is better. Thanks.eAthletes🎆|#NBA2K22🎆🏀|🎦twitch

#NBA https://t.co/Ho2jFdT9Z2@OrlandoMagic Follow up. Found his Twitter. @Reesecustomz did shoes for @Lane_Kiffin@OrlandoMagic These are his ig handles. He’s the best for the job. Hands down. Just did a pair for @Lane_Kiffin @OleMiss     

@j_reese19 or his art handle is @solecandy_customzTwo questions for Warriors Twitter.

What should we expect from Paolo Banchero and the Orlando Magic? and

What should the Warriors do to win against the Orlando Magic?I hope we get a heads up prior to Markelle coming back, cause I'm trying to be front and center. #TheReturn

Be sure to give it a listen and chime in the next open court space we have!! #MagicTogether  #MagicCity https://t.co/ojtcdYtSoYLooks like Kevin Durant's season is over, suffering a head injury during last night's game against the Orlando Magic.I made school honor roll and they gave out one free ticket to a Orlando magic game that’s cool@usarmy @SecretService there once was a puff, there once was one more, after the first puff puff stuffed the pipe with more.

Puff will burn you down doesn’t care what you think about crown.@OrlandoMagic @Ticketmaster @BolBol Perfect time to swing back into momentum. We need our roster to come back healthy during this period to feel the energy of playing at home. Expecting at least 5 wins for the next 7. If done, we are still in the fight. If not, season is overThursday's basketball action will start when the Orlando Magic host the Golden State Warriors for the 2022-2023 NBA Regular Season.

Download SportAI NOW for the best fantasy analytics 🔥 https://t.co/FP6mGZVJFBSources are saying the Sacramento Kings are trading Mikal Bridges to the Orlando Magic for C.J. McCollum and Bradley Beal.Orlando Magic have so much great young talent. They should be contending for a playoff spot this season. After what Cleveland did with  young talent. It's no excuse unless it's coaching.In Orlando’s WW #758, Dark Fates mocked Jason for his life of "disgrace". Rebirth Jason was (1) trained by Hercules, (2) awarded a magic suit by the Greek gods, (3) joined ARGUS, (4) teamed up with JUSTICE LEAGUE and (3) saved Earth! No disgrace, here. Think this is New 52 Jason? https://t.co/d8p1bF5NwS@pittman_easton @OrlandoMagic he is thats how lottery works lmao[UPDATE] Golden State Warriors -8.0 (-8.5) at Orlando Magic | Thu 19:10ET #GSWvsORL #NBA ~ https://t.co/R5SB8rlHYT@OrlandoMagic 4 more art my insta is
