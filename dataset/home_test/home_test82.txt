THIS YEAR they are both 1 and 4.@Knigh20Knight @BleacherReport @BrooklynNets Sticking to facts that Sixers won trade based on games played.

Not two old busted superstars that break down every playoffs now. Trade them both for assets while you can.

The era is over. They fucksd us when they demanded Harden tradeI am sick of this anti-vax, flat earther, anti-semite.  How can this player be tolerated in #Brooklyn? What are the #Nets doing about this?

 https://t.co/YgNgxEBNJV@JacManuell That’s nonsense. Sure Ben has to be better and I for one can see his game coming back slowly but surely. He’s shown flashes of all of it. He just has to put it together. But the Nets lost not because of Ben but because Dallas made shots in crunch time and Brooklyn didn’t.Dallas Mavericks vs Brooklyn Nets – Full Game Highlights | October 27, 2022 | 2022-23 NBA Season https://t.co/8bI6UZlZ6hStephen A.: There is NO EXCUSE Ben Simmons can’t be an elite defender | NBA Countdown #Brooklyn #Nets #NBA Video: https://t.co/UG1Fj2F9RT@JfromBk @BrooklynNets Lmao y'all think is 2k or some shit.
