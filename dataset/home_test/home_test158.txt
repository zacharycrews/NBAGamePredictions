Mavs Win at the Free-Throw Line: Is the Orlando Magic Game a Trap? https://t.co/6vDlg9sir7Mavs 2Q -2 (-115)
Dallas has been a 2Q wagon. They are 8-1 ATS in the 2Q. In the last 5 games, DAL ranks 1st in defense and rebound % in the 2Q. Paolo Banchero is out tonight for Orlando, so the Magic will use a big lineup, and DAL should win from the perimeter.is back home, they should be comfortable and ready to perform. I love that I get to fade the Utah Jazz on their first East Coast trip.

The Dallas game is this simple, Paolo Banchero is not playing for the Orlando Magic, that means you take the Mavericks. 

Big Slate. Let's Ridedear Heavenly Father,

I know I ask for a lot, but today I ask that the Dallas Mavericks would blow the Orlando Magic so far out of the water that Jaden Hardy plays at least 10 minutes

All Orange County government offices closed down at 3:00 pm today!@SvmHCS @HeatNationCom I love our culture I love the ball movement and hard nose style of play but at some point you take a look at our roster and realize the Orlando magic might have more talent than us… that’s a problemVIDEO: Jonathan Isaac is getting closer to his return

Dallas -8.5 Handicap 

Odds: 2.00 (SKYBET)

Stake: £10.00

Dallas look too strong for the Magic who will be without Banchero who has been scoring the bulk of the points for them. 

#NBA #nbaprops #NBATwitterLiveThe @OrlandoMagic front office is the worst. By far. All they care about is “creating a family environment.” They don’t wanna win. Since 2013 this team does not value winning. I wouldn’t even be shocked if they don’t do anything l seasonOh yeah that’s why, because their the Orlando MagicLuka and the @dallasmavs getting an early start vs @OrlandoMagic due to Tropical Storm Nicole. @tygavin13 is looking to get the night started on the right track with Luka Doncic over 33.5 points (-120) and #Magic Team Total over 103.5 (-125). Will you #FadeorFollow? https://t.co/OCjWbLRYFFThe #Magic are playing a low total game vs the #Mavs tonight having scored 127 points on Monday in a loss to the #Rockets.

I work nights and have to go to bed and will be asleep during your game. Thanks in advance.Just a reminder, in case it was missed with the NBA off for Election Day:

Tonight's Mavericks-Magic game in Orlando has been pushed up from a 7:00 PM ET start to a 5:30 PM ET start.The #MagicTogether was established in 1989, as an expansion franchise, featuring eight outstanding players. Then the Orlando Magic competed in the National Basketball Association (NBA) as a member of the league's Eastern Conference Southeast Division. #BTSSportsGuru #NBA@OrlandoMagic @dallasmavs @AmwayCenter @BallySportsFL @BallyMagic @969thegame Is the rain gonna be bad?? Is it safe to show up?Then - It's unfortunate that the Orlando Magic won the lottery with no clear number 1 pick.
