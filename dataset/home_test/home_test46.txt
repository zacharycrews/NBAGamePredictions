https://t.co/JYmUVgzxJ4The outcome of this is that despite getting the “new management” paint job, the modern @chicagobulls aren’t that much different than the pre-Boylen GarPax era, they are just being more subtle when they tell the fans “be grateful and kick rocks.”Another nice test for this Celtics team early on taking on the Chicago Bulls in Chicago. This team has clicked very well early on still getting things figured out on defense, offensively doing great things looking forward to the game tonight !CLEVELAND CAVALIERS 128-96
