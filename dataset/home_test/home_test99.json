    "574": "@FrankRi31247868 @nathanmarzion @Bucks @packers Correct? But I also don\u2019t consider a basketball team, which losing individual players has a far greater effect than football, taking a finals team to 7 without their second best is hardly disappointing. But sure. They were.",
    "575": "@FrankRi31247868 @nathanmarzion @Bucks @packers Say the Bucks finish with 4 rings after giannis, tying the packers for their all time championships. You can go ahead and argue at that point that the packers are still a more successful franchise because of playoff births or whatever.",

No shit, If the Packers win the next 3 Super Bowls, and we can conquer mars, it will be a pretty good 3 years. It would be legit.",

Plenty of bucks playoffs those decades. No one cares. Because they didn\u2019t win it all. Just like no one should care about the packers 2000\u2019s \u201csuccess\u201d. All meaningless.",
    "579": "@FrankRi31247868 @nathanmarzion @Bucks @packers No one cares about how many times the packers made the playoffs, or an NFC championship game.

    "580": "@FrankRi31247868 @nathanmarzion @Bucks @packers Jesus dude, my actual argument is what I said. The bucks could finish with 4 or more rings after giannis, which would be the same, or more, as Green Bay. Making them, in terms of anyone\u2019s legitimate measurement of end goal success, just as, or more successful than the packers.",
