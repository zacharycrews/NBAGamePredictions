Maybe KAT can stop picking up so many goddamn fouls now that he doesn't have to play center, lol. And perhaps we'll see Anthony Edwards taking another big leap.

OVER 48.5 Wins. Rudy Gobert impacts regular season winning &amp; they have an epic reg season

Best: Edwards is a superstar, KAT &amp; Gobert play well in the playoffs, &amp; make the finals

The more I think about it, the less I like the Gobert trade. Similarly, as the years pass the less valuable the polarizing big man will be. Minnesota waged a lot with that trade. For their sake, I hope it yields results quickly. https://t.co/eqy8SiHDZQWhat Does an ‘A Grade’ Season Look Like for the Minnesota Timberwolves? https://t.co/n18n3TNoIi via @canishoopus
