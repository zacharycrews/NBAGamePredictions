I'm already sick of watching the Phoenix Suns.kevin durant is WASHED he will never win anything again

as a DIE HARD nets fan i think we need to trade him to the phoenix suns for jae crowder and maybe a pick before he loses all his value@wowguy08235386 @NBAPaint1 Lakers got eliminated in the 2021 NBA Playoffs unable to make WIDE OPEN 3-POINTERS against Phoenix Suns 4 defenders clogging the paint. 😄😄😄
Westbrook is no solution for that, you trade 257---3-pointers to Washington in Kuzma &amp; KCP. Silliness https://t.co/xlWAbYA6RQWhat’s the gorilla mascot has to do with the Phoenix sun nba team (and the owner got suspended for the n word n messing with female workers) it’s crazy what these people get away with@wowguy08235386 @NBAPaint1 During the 2021 NBA Playoffs when the Phoenix Suns clogged the paint with 4 defenders there was no PLAYOFF DENNIS to shoot 44% for 3-pointers like Rondo did vs. Houston. 
Lakers deserve this punishment for disrespecting NBA Champions.@KDTrey5 please request a trade again and come to Phoenix Suns. https://t.co/X1IOIfZzmr$6.50 - Boston Celtics

Latest markets below.The #Suns are an 11.5-point favorite over the #Rockets for #Sunday's #NBA game in Phoenix. https://t.co/wzbmHnJiO6This is why Kevin Durant shoulda went to the Phoenix Suns@HutzSR @topshot_updates @NBATopShot LoL @ "casual" - Mikal is good on D and being a role player. Watch some Suns games and you'll see who is good on their team and worth being the reward. Phoenix Suns.🤣🤣😭 RT @AuntieSlayer: Look, it’s time to face facts. Kevin Durant is the problem in Brooklyn. He is just simply not good enough. The obvious solution is to send him to the Phoenix suns for Jae CrowderAfter tonight’s loss to the Pacers, the Nets fall to 1-5. Their worst start since 2015. 

Kevin Durant is averaging 32 points per game. 

Meanwhile, the team he requested a trade to, the Phoenix Suns, are 4-1. Good for the 2 seed in the NBA so far. 

Uh oh. 👀 https://t.co/PJrZgcFriHLook, it’s time to face facts. Kevin Durant is the problem in Brooklyn. He is just simply not good enough. The obvious solution is to send him to the Phoenix suns for Jae Crowder@Black_Action Did anyone hear about him potentially becoming a *minority owner* in the NBA franchise Phoenix Suns?😳🤦🏿‍♂️

Same ole Barack, a mascot for white capital and never missing an opportunity to capitalize from our pain, smdh.The Phoenix #Suns are rising on the list of the #NBA's most valuable franchises. https://t.co/yXWL6WoHQO
