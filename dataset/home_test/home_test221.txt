#SacramentoProud https://t.co/AhhbVv3DqIHow bad were @BrooklynNets last night against @SacramentoKings ?

Ben Simmons was the most aggressive Nets offensive player in the second half.

Note: All of Simmons’ aggression came after Kings were up by 30@SacramentoKings @TerenceDavisJr Huerter isn't better than T.davis or M.monk @Sg &amp; i think Huerter is better than H.barns but Huerter is smaller than H.barns for Huerter@Sf, so why not trade Huerter to New York or Florida or East coast teams for 2 Small Forwards &amp; bring back deMarcus cousins@center as 3rd sub.If the NBA season ended today, the Sacramento Kings would finish with the second best eFG% in NBA history.

Fox and Sabonis are true star duo and Kevin Heurter is shooting 52% from three.
