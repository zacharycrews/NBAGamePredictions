Miami comes out early and hard, looking like they’re going to do it. After halftime the injuries become too much, legs wear down, Boston hits a 23-5 run and the Heat will be out of gas for the comeback. 

That’s my prediction.

Or mad cause ur “super star” that went 4-14 in most games is actually bad and u just can’t admit that?@CashNasty Lucky they have to either play the heat or Celtics but I really want the toe heat to go so Kyle can get another and miami can get theirs after being Robbed from the bubble as they were hurt@BaldyNFL @JasonLaCanfora @celtics @MiamiHEAT Why is it so foggy?The way the Miami Heat are run, is so damn cool. Pat Riley really has a phenomenal culture with former players stepping into franchise leadership roles after their playing career is over. One of the few professional organizations that shows major loyalty.This team let go of the rope when they should've fought the hardest.
Winning now in Miami against them wanting to shut everyone who doubted them up, herro back, after that game by Butler and the refs?
It saddens me to say it but my money is on the heat.

The Celtics might get blown out. They moved on mentally from the Heat before game 6. HUGE mistake.@jghd77 @MichelobULTRA @MiamiHEAT This isn’t an airport, no need to announce your departure.Miami Heat limited Jayson Tatum to just 1 Field-Goal Attempt and 4 turnovers in the 4th quarter of Game 6 in the Eastern Conference Finals. Here's how the Miami Heat nearly shutout Tatum in the 4th quarter https://t.co/XuuoFn3EPT@MiamiHEAT escort this man out of the arena right now https://t.co/32znVMClEVI have this weird, nervous feeling the #MiamiHeat really believe they can win it tonight. They aren't as deep, or as talented, and should have been eliminated already cause they are hurt. And the Celtics can't put them away. Anything can happen in game 7sKinda embarrassing that @stephenasmith still talk about how Jayson Tatum &amp; Brown are like some modern day version of MJ &amp; Pippen still after repeatedly seeing both coming up short in this series vs @MiamiHEAT

Miami comes out early and hard, looking like they’re going to do it. After halftime the injuries become too much, legs wear down, Boston hits a 23-5 run and the Heat will be out of gas for the comeback. 

That’s my prediction.@nuthinbutheat @MiamiHEAT I appreciate it homie, just bringing the good vibes with my sons for game 7!! #LFG #HEATCulture@MiamiHEAT i started stroking it so fast 😭😭Because it's doesn't make any sense if the Miami Heat players is missing shots they was making in game 1 and 2 and 3 and 4 and 5,6 .

- Predicted to be the team meeting GS in Finals 

- #1 defense 

- Having the best player in the series 

- Doubts about Miami’s HC offenseI’m sticking with my pre-playoff prediction… THE MIAMI HEAT ARE GOING THE FINALS! 🔥&gt;☘️ https://t.co/7Nx500rg8zYou know what to do, @MiamiHEAT. https://t.co/WwGdAAtICgWhat is the point of winning game 6 @ Boston if you’re just going to lose game 7 on your home court???

It just doesn’t make sense to me. I don’t understand why most people think the Celtics win this game… 

Erik Spoelstra is the best coach in the league. 

Miami Heat ML +125 https://t.co/BKk2vGPMwx@MiamiHEAT Yeah, he'll just brick a lot of shots.@Lane_ @MiamiHEAT White wishes his hair line was that goodI got @MiamiHEAT winning tonight fasho@Underdog__NBA if Miami wins tonight and another series of Heat Injury reports https://t.co/1QoJi0SpkGTyler herro is my fav player in Miami heat after Jimmy but I am not sure that he will change anything in the game he was not good enough in this playoffs I wish he can change that today let’s go heat #HEATCulture@MiamiHEAT BURN THE BOATS!!!It's win or go home today in Miami! #NBAPlayoffs

They looked overwhelmed. Wouldn’t be surprised if the Heat won by 15 tonight. #NBAPlayoffs #Celtics #HEATCultureIn order for the #MiamiHeat to win #Game7, they'll have to (at least) shoot &gt; 51 eFG% (unlikely), attempt 18 FT's (fairly unlikely), and force at least 17 turnovers against the #BostonCeltics.

Jimmy has taken Bosh's Heat spot, but Miami would've been Wade/Zo/Bron/Bosh before that.

Warriors aren't myPeople saying they want Boston to beat Miami because they are the only chance to beat warriors. That makes no sense because if Heat beat them it shows they are a more efficient and superior team@Hockfan445 @MiamiHEAT ratiooooooTodays a good day to go to the NBA Finals @MiamiHEAT@CityOfChampion2 @MiamiHEAT @CocoGauff Athletes trade jerseys as a show of respect.

Report to Norfolk @MatthewSgroi1Need @MiamiHEAT to win tonight…@MiamiHEAT L incoming i’m afraid@MiamiHEAT It’s a one game series, every great player dreams of the win or go home scenario.  The heat have been doubted and crapped upon since the all star break.  They can’t do it, they ain’t that good, they are not up to their competition.. is all we heard all along.  Yet who was #1 EC?@NBA Miami Heat next question.The @celtics are a more talented team than the @MiamiHEAT. But that doesn’t mean they are the better team. I believe in Spo and this this team’s ability to execute a game plan to win at home and advance tonight.

I hope Herro plays, but either way, I’m taking the Heat in game 7.@JackedAcctnt @MiamiHEAT I just wanna know how I looked at that read all the replies and wrote a reply back offering to pay somebodyYou really think @MiamiHEAT gone lose 3 games at home in a single series? #HeatIn7 #HEATCulture https://t.co/2QH5KruQ6rGame 7

#BleedGreen #HEATCulture https://t.co/6ANrGvVp9y@nolimitlefko @shookness10 @johnhollinger Miami doesn't attack, hence no foul. 
Not atypical whatsoever. Look at NBA stats not ur video game stats. Ur NBA2K season has nothing to do with actual basketball. The NBA admits to mistakes, only Heat ball lickers or delusional NBA execs think game 6 was ok. 25-5 tells y NBA=WWEProud of y'all boys @MiamiHEAT, unfortunately Adam Silver made a decision https://t.co/jI2Bgnu32GAll my cousins are hyped and ready for todays game.

I still got Miami Heat winning the NBA Finals. If they beat Celtics, than we could see Miami Heat facing Warriors. This game will be intense for the Heat.

IT’S GAMEDAY IN MIAMI, HEAT NATION STAND UP 🔥

#HEATCulture https://t.co/9tlVa9P5UlIt’s crazy because I SAID Heat in 7. I believed that Miami at home would be the best possible ending to this story. And we got it. Through all the adversity we GOT IT. Let’s do this MiamiNow, it's time for you to win @MiamiHEAT https://t.co/t3W1qAowdl@MiamiHEAT So proud of Jimmy but where is bam ?I'll keep this receipt for later.

But it’s in MIA.Let go Miami Heattoday is the day to guarantee the spot in the final.

@MiamiHEAT https://t.co/Ri3eW1Wq3U@Money23Green is to much of a smart defensive minded player to think playoff games are over with 3 wins. He sees pros and cons and believe the @MiamiHEAT lack of health and offensive production would be an easier match up. He’s aggressive but not dumb 🌳Oh man please win tonight @MiamiHEAT https://t.co/ID09EfVIF2@PeterHooley12 We really need The Miami Heat to go to the finals. They have lost the last 2 home games. I can't see them losing 3 in a row at home. Boston beat Milwaukee by going on the road and then coming home to defeat them in 7. This will happen in this series.Miami Heat or Boston Celtics 👀While some people are rooting for the Miami Heat and others are rooting for Scott Foster, I'll be rooting for the Boston Celtics and the rule of law!!Payton Pritchard plays his final Playoff Game against the Miami Heat to move onto the NBA Finals in 11 hours.Just put money on the Miami Heat. You’re welcome in advance Cs fans.Yeah… this looking like another Jimmy masterclass and a blowout for Miami to solidly that they are the best team in the East and rightfully so. The only reason why Boston got games 4-5 was because the Heat were INJURED@charles_miami @issaburrna Shane is part of Heat front office. He'll be there.I bet my life savings on y'all. Please don't have them Russians at my door.

#NBA75 #NBAPlayoffs #NBATwitter https://t.co/QwLeJnoDDj@SprouseCarson @RealSkipBayless Yea but the warriors have an overall better offense and they are 2nd in Defense . Let the Celtics worry about the Heat first that will beat them tomorrow in Miami!

Look into the context of the Green comment and u see that he says he thinks they're gonna play the @celtics. But either way, Green won't just be breaking a code, but Miami/Boston dreams as well. https://t.co/qTPLvL03t8@MiamiHEAT we MOVE. https://t.co/9iN9Hc17GdWE BACK. Just moved out to Miami.

Bron left Miami in 2014 and the Heat made its next finals appearance in 2020. It still took them 6 years to rebuild. Teams fall apart when their franchise player leaves. Bulls still rebuilding since MJ left.The Miami Heat signed Aric Holman to a 10-day contract this year for ~$50K, and he never set foot on the court.

$25K for a tactic that possibly won them a pivotal #NBAPlayoffs game?

Yeah...
Yeah....
YEAH...
IT IS ON... NOW IS THE TIME... #7And that's about when it was time for Miami to break through ...

LeBron dunk. Miami by one
Bosh 3. Miami by four.

Finally, it was more than a one-possession game -- and the Heat kept control the rest of the way.

By any measure, a classic Game 7. 

https://t.co/Ni7SunBTzcMiami’s Big 3 scored the final 31 Heat points. The great @chrisbosh, playing hurt, hit the corner 3 that broke Boston with 7:17 left.
But it took an epic heavyweight fight to get there.

The Celtics were up 59-51 in the third. An 8-0 Heat run tied it. And then ...

#HeatIn7 https://t.co/tkrtXO1rgs@YSMF_stfu @Driice__ @NBA @MiamiHEAT I you said the Heat found Jimmy Butler’s talent  that would just be completely wrong because he was already good before hand. You could use it interchangeably though for a player like Max Strus interchangeably.Ime Udoka says Boston Celtics need better start vs Miami Heat, can’t ‘give them early life’ in Game 7 https://t.co/1Z1pMdYgukIme Udoka says Boston Celtics need better start vs Miami Heat, can’t ‘give them early life’ in Game 7 https://t.co/P4b3SJSAdNThe Miami Heat? Wow, who would have thought https://t.co/Wqe0YJvSaZThe Heat hit 43% of their 3s in their Game 6 victory.

Miami is now 31-2 this season when it makes at least 40% of its 3s.

The Heat are 33-33 in all other games.

When the 3s fall, Miami is basically invincible. When they don't, it's literally a coin flip.@HVTWpodcast @MiamiHEAT Nah. They’ve always denied me even before I began tweeting this. The hate to a fanpage is real@YSMF_stfu @Driice__ @NBA @MiamiHEAT I couldn’t care less if my team was better at finding talent. Considering the team I’m a fan of is actually really good at finding talent as well. Also why exactly should I grow up?
