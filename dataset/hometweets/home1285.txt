Miami has injury concerns, but with a more well-rounded roster, the 1 seed is favored to go up 2-0 in the series.

Butler has covered this steals number in 6 straight games, Miami comes into tonight averaging 17.2% opponent turnover per possession over their last 3. The heat lost the first half in game 1, expecting the team to come out with more urgency. https://t.co/iljZ8bzX1m@NothinButSkillz @MiamiHEAT Outfit pic!? I'll be watching for ya bro!The @MiamiHEAT are heavy favorites as they host the @sixers for Game 2🍿

I believe that Miami’s defense will prove to be too much to handle for Harden and the 76ers! The game will be over at half time🔥🔥

Who do you think takes Game 2?

Heat 1H -4.5 

Miami comes out playing solid defense and hits their shots. They cover the first half spread. Putting a unit on this. IF Miami finds itself down at half, we reevaluate and take a live position to make the unit make and win some coin. 🤑Miami enters as 8.5-point favorites in Game 2, and I believe they can easily cover for the second consecutive game.

Today's Picks

Heat Sixers Under 207.5 - All Miami playoff games have gone under. Game one finished at 198.

Deandre Ayton over 18.5 pts - in 7 playoff games Ayton has gone over 6 times.

Obviously he's gonna average more but talent wise it's stupid to say Lukas light-years above@jpthreesus @Zac58552665 @raf_tyler @MiamiHEAT Bro Trae just got destroyed by us proving just how effective he is when good playoff teams guard him. All I'm saying is if Herro was a number one option in a small franchise he'd have those numbers. Not the same when you 13th and your not a first or even second option as a rookieEmbiid will miss at least Game 2 in Miami, but the 76ers will look to beat the Heat tonight without the MVP candidate.

-Joel Embiid (orbital fracture/concussion) is OUT

HEAT:
-Kyle Lowry (left hamstring strain) is OUT
-Bevy of Miami players are questionable but likely to play: Herro, Martin, Strus, Tucker, VincentHeat/76ers Notes:

Heat shot (9-36) 25% from 3 point range. Duncan Robinson didn't play 1 second. Butler had 15 pts on 5-16 shooting &amp; Miami still won Game 1 by 14. Bam (25 pts/12 rebs) should dominate the paint again. Things could get ugly, early for the 76ers.

Philly shot 6/34 from deep last game. Miami didn’t do much better at 9/36, and we still almost reached 200 points. I’m hoping for a close game with some late fouls to push us over.

if the Raptors pushed the 6ers to 6, Miami has more support scoring + vets than can show up

Pays $134 in profit

Say Miami wins game 2.

I bet Philly moneyline on game 3 @ an example price of +170.

I now need to spend ≈$59 @ a 170% return to cover my initial $100 risk

I’ll break even if Philly wins game 3 or return 75% w/ a Heat win@jpthreesus @Zac58552665 @raf_tyler @MiamiHEAT Bro chill it's from early in the season. Luka's points are outdated but only by 6. The point is that Tyler IS in the same convo. Just a matter of the other two being the only all star on their team so they gotta carry a lot harder@Zac58552665 @raf_tyler @MiamiHEAT What are these stats even from? Luka has averaged that few point since his rookie year. And he's never averaged under 31 in the playoffs. Soooo, bs graphic huh?@GeorgeRussell63 @MiamiHEAT Respect and keep fighting. Your consistency will be the key.@GmoOnTheMic @cohen_HR_Law @NBA @MiamiHEAT Are you assuming I’m rooting against the heat? I’m not.. or that I’m a phill fan? Definitely not. Idk what your in about@KentuckyMBB @raf_tyler @MiamiHEAT @NBA This is embarrassing but congrats Tyler@sleepy_head_23 Agreed. No guarantee they would take 2 in Miami with Joel. Heat were the 1 seed and favored anyway so a split without the big guy would be great@FanSince09 If u mean it looked like the lights were literally out, and the Heat couldn't see the basket at all,... then yes, I agree with u, because Miami shot horribly. Sometimes rest can mean rust; especially when u have an entire week off.#DuncanRobinson scores 27 points leading the #MiamiHeat to victory in the #NBAPlayoffs &amp; for that he gets #benched? Concerned citizens want to know. WTF!  Is Coach #ErikSpoelstra being mind controlled by an #Extraterrestrial or a #Demon? Play Duncan Robinson now! https://t.co/R8vVqcqjf2If you think the Miami Heat have a good chance to win Game 2 against the 76ers, look for the “Miami to lead 3-0 after 3 games” bet in your sportsbook

Fanduel has it @ +134

If the Heat win Game 2, hedge via 76ers moneyline prior to Game 3 (I estimate it will be ≈ +170 to +225)@realwilliam59 @MiamiHEAT U can’t be talking dude@DonPabloDada @MiamiHEAT @HeatvsHaters 4 Days later.ur still crying..🤣🤣🤣I shared NBA picks + props for Philadelphia 76ers vs Miami Heat game 2 here ⬇️🤝 Enjoy your night! https://t.co/t4LqkHB86dDwayne Wade Miami Heat Signed A #autographed https://t.co/8FWgFHHYrc@Happy2BlockU @MiamiHEAT @celtics Thanks and YYYAAAAASSSSSS!!!!! https://t.co/pzpitfxeeB@piotrekzprod @JimmyButler @MiamiHEAT Looks like an NBA 2K23 cover.@MiamiHEAT @raf_tyler Congrats to our TYLER HERRO!@BamericaSZN @MiamiHEAT @raf_tyler @Kia You heard me@NBA @raf_tyler @MiamiHEAT Deserved@GeorgeRussell63 @MiamiHEAT George has the makings of a superstar lolPhiladelphia 76ers vs Miami Heat May 4, 2022 Game Summary | https://t.co/7QFFdbcrz5🌱 Edgewater Luxury Truck Stolen + Miami Heat Progress - Patch https://t.co/b6UmM8V6a7 https://t.co/9MLQE0DEln https://t.co/tEt1UjXWDM2 Pick Parlay that hit Monday night…Phoenix Suns and Miami Heat https://t.co/euhDWwVKT3Miami Heat - Philadelphia 76ers
