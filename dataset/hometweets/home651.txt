Double teaming Trae would be a disaster if every one would consistently hit on a nightly basis.@leedex666 @Stillncrj1 @dracodzns @Atlantasports20 @FCHWPO @ATLHawks Now you are right, but game after game trae has done this and different players every night don’t hit the open looks man. Then we get ling rebounds and the score is ran up through transition buckets. Then the battle becomes uphills and he has to create an offense.We are LIVE at our MLK Day Pregame Panel: Building Generational Wealth presented by @Chase!

Bogi, Gallo, and JC are he only tradable contracts that match. JC doesn’t make sense and Gallo’s buyout is needed to get below the tax next year.@BigDaddySamurai @ATLHawks @Chase @Bucks @StateFarmArena @NBAonTNT @929TheGame They should wear those every time they play on MLK day from now on.@dracodzns @ATLHawks @okcthunder @shaiglalex fireee@dracodzns @ATLHawks @okcthunder @shaiglalex Wouldn't be good for the team.

Gallo can at least help with the salary difference. But we’d likely have to give up way too much and I’ve know fans get panicked. But, just wait and see what we do….

I wanted pels to sign Collins in the off season. Love his game@KhelifiYanis3 @dracodzns @PelicansNBA @ATLHawks Lmao you think that’s going to land you the pelicans best player who they have locked down for years and he wants to be there and organization is admitting now that it’s his team? Don’t think that will happen.Oh yea I ain’t forget.

@nyknicks &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; @ATLHawks 

#KnicksTape@dracodzns @PelicansNBA @ATLHawks That hawks team going to ECF@JonnyRoccIT @PelicansNBA @ATLHawks Got another swap dropping soon with another potential candidate@dracodzns @PelicansNBA @ATLHawks He can play…i just never liked his personality. Doesn’t seem like a good Locker Room guy. Same with Ben Simmons. Smh Our Options ain’t too good RNBasketball not that serious. Atlanta Hawks fans do better forreal https://t.co/eliUlWfc9eTomorrow is #MLKDay and a National day of service. The NBA has a full slate of games lined up

Trae, Brown, Knox, Bum, Bum

And have no picks. Celtics gonna demand our entire roster and draft capital.@MixerNitro @PelicansNBA @ATLHawks basically everything because their front office is egotistical@dracodzns @PelicansNBA @ATLHawks Ohhhhhh lmao my bad my guy. Just had been tired of us losing so much from bad defense.

Brown would be great but what do we have to give the Celtics?@MixerNitro @PelicansNBA @ATLHawks i was implying that we could get both with jaylen brown lol@dracodzns @PelicansNBA @ATLHawks Bruh y’all need to stop wishing on a star they’re not trading Ingram Zion maybe but Ingram nope😜@MixerNitro @PelicansNBA @ATLHawks great defense and a second scorer?? https://t.co/dCzzKXcmkQ@dracodzns @PelicansNBA @ATLHawks I would love to get Ingram if we had great defense and needed a second scorer.@KhelifiYanis3 @dracodzns @PelicansNBA @ATLHawks what is this app@dracodzns @PelicansNBA @ATLHawks i been said he is what we needed. imo he is the perfect fit@ATLHawks and @umichbball You are responsible for this and I'll never look at you the same again...

Maybe a big company like the @NBA or @ATLHawks dont understand that but damn… it’s beyond frustrating as a mother and wife seeing them disappointedSo frustrated with this. I ordered a @ATLHawks jersey ( #johncollins #20) for my step son for Christmas. We were going to a game the day after and they were so excited to have their jerseys on.
Never showed up. Still hasn’t. @NBA@KhelifiYanis3 @dracodzns @PelicansNBA @ATLHawks Huerter has a poison pill but I'd do that deal yesterday. Maybe add hawks pick next year or top ten protections this year. But this would only be I'm assuming if zion wants out.After Trae, I can't make any promises. I'm not Travis Schlenk. These guys know it too. If the Toronto Raptors could keep Pascal Siakam, the Atlanta Hawks could keep Cam Reddish. Didn't happen. A few of those names could also be traded. https://t.co/TgOt32rQWz https://t.co/pE5azeSTRZ@dracodzns @icetraeforever2 @PelicansNBA @ATLHawks When you do basketball swaps the best way to do it imo is to take the whole jersey and put it on the other player, when it comes to football swaps adding the elements to the jersey and using hue/sat or a color gradient is the best way to change color.@dracodzns @PelicansNBA @ATLHawks I hope https://t.co/2hNtGcdz2Q🏀 Milwaukee Bucks (@Bucks) #FearTheDeer
