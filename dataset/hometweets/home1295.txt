Sixers/Heat: I believe Embiid has his break out game of the series and Philly steals one in Miami. (Yes he’s angry about the MVP). 3-2 Philly 

Mavs/Suns:I think this will end on a Luka game winner, Mavs 3-2.

Miami lost 2 straight and are back at home for Game 5 series tied 2-2.

Ultimate sense of urgency/bounce back spot. Erik Spoelstra will make adjustments.

Sixers have yet to advance past R2 in the Embiid era and haven’t been over that hump in 21 years.

Both teams better want it regardless of “pressure” narrative, tbh. https://t.co/lJ1Lk87eB2The worst news the @MiamiHEAT could’ve gotten yesterday was Jokic winning MVP. I’m expecting Embiid to come out pissed off and play like a savage. Hopefully the Heat is prepared for it. #HEATCulture#NBA 🏀

Wiinnnnnnn boys 👦 👦 👦@MiamiHEAT Understandable… needs the rest 🥲The Philadelphia 76ers got Joel Embiid back, the Miami Heat will be without Kyle Lowry for Game 5. It’s probably time to completely reassess this series.

Here are NBA Playoff Pick 'Ems from @trulyitbemax | @SNBets 

https://t.co/p6jM7HrySO@MiamiHEAT Can’t defend well on that hamstring or get to the rim efficiently oof@MiamiHEAT Heat in 6!Miami Heat in 7 🔒🔒🔒 https://t.co/2Lhrk4oILAThe rebuttal for the Lowry situation in Miami that he's injured simply supports the point. Entering this season, the Heat's durability was the biggest concern.

https://t.co/ImYSLNVs8p@BillB7581 @TonyPasquarella @BinksBtw @LesBowen That's not what is going on. According the NBA's own data, the Miami Heat shot 6/29 on open 3s (next defender 6 feet away or further). That's 21% on wide open 3s. In the regular season Miami shot 40.8% on those shots. This is all shot variance.Before I make my player bets on @FDSportsbook for @sixers vs @MiamiHEAT game, does anybody know if @JHarden13 was in a Miami nightclub last night?

This is the Miami Heat's problem. 

You need players to raise their games in the postseason. 

Only Jimmy Butler (50-57%) has.

If SPO uses Duncan at any point in this series, that will make you, and him, wrong!Miami Heat/Florida Panthers? I'm not even sure that counts. Probably not. 

https://t.co/zt1gFhCyjFAlthough Joel Embiid won’t win MVP this year, he’s proving his immense two-way impact on the Sixers against the Miami Heat.

My latest at @ForbesSports: https://t.co/XmSshPS2X6We're taking it back to the beginning, HBD to our first ever draft pick @RonySeikaly! 🎂

@MiamiHEAT // @Publix https://t.co/Jk5s71dE8OMiami Heat v Philadelphia 76ers 🏀
Jimmy Butler looks to take advantage of the absence of the 76ers main man, Joel Embiid and take Miami Heat to a 2-0 lead.

#heatculture@FlaPanthers and @MiamiHEAT series both tied at (2-2). Gotta get it done.@HeatNationCom Admit it heat fans we’re in some serious trouble. I don’t see how we can turn it around. We haven’t got shooters. And Miami has no idea how to guard embiid.Tomorrow night when and whenever the heat beat the 76ers J.J. Redick better apologize @HeatNationCom  which I really know the heat is really gonna win at home Miami heat nation gonna make a lot of noise https://t.co/zboFAFy6jL@ESRburner I’m a Miami Heat fan indeed@Alf_Arteaga Sixers will live with Heat players shooting on the move. it’s not a perfect strategy, but it’s harder than corner threes. yes, Miami shooters will shoot better. Jimmy &amp; Bam also won’t shoot 68% every night. but if you think Embiid hasn’t made a big diff that’s fine lol@RohanNadkarni I think the Suns 2-2 feels different than Miami’s 2-2 absolutely. No suns fan is worried, And Heat fans sweating a bit for sure.If Philly wins the series the MVP for Philly will be Spoelstra. Not playing Robinson when Miami is 14-65 21.5% from 3 the last 2 games is BS.  #55 spreads the floor to create shots for everyone and he can hit 3s at an elite %.

It’ll be an embarrassment for the talent on our team to lose 3 in a roll@IraHeatBeat I don’t understand why they don’t use the depth to run the sixers out of the gym.

Nice try tho bud.@MiamiHEAT Cmon man Embiid is playing with a orbital fracture and torn ligament in his thumb. We need to step it up@ionized4091 That’s cool I wish Miami did these we don’t even have game day program at Heat Covid took that away and I haven’t been to a marlins game yet this year@AshMunroWGroup @KyleNeubeck @MiamiHEAT @LockedOnHeat @sixers That’s a given, you can’t let embiid have a one on one with anyone in this league, if that happens he’s going to put up monster numbers every night@tristan35717881 @MiamiHEAT One play is not gonna change the game bud.Does anybody else think that it's WILD that the calmest series right now is THE MIAMI HEAT vs THE PHILADELPHIA 76ers and the KINGS didn't make the disastrous choice?

I was saying, with Embiid back and clogging the paint they're giving us open looks at the 3.. No one is hitting.  Plus they been trapping Herro every chance they get that means they're leaving someone open.What happens if an NBA player gets banned from a state. Like imagine Hawks vs Heat but the state of Georgia says we do not welcome Jimmy Butler. Do they play all games in Miami? Does he just have to sit out games 3 and 4? Realistically what does Adam Silver do.@LeoFB1907 @MiamiHEAT golden state is respectfully #3@KingJames  What would you say in the post game press conference after that one?? Were you with the @MiamiHEAT  @cavs or @Lakers or high school when this happened???   I hope you learned a valuable lesson that day.   @CP3  @carmeloanthony @DwyaneWade what is the final verdict??? https://t.co/5oo80rXASm https://t.co/QeZ0G0VkZgThe Florida Panthers are equally as bad on a power play as the Miami Heat are from 3 #TimeToHunt@Tr3Prom @Copped_em_early @MiamiHEAT why he aint been getting no burn? defense?what happens first, a florida panthers powerplay goal or a miami heat 3 pointer?@NBAKrell Similar to situation with FVV… I think the heat are better off not playing Lowry while he’s 50-75%…

8-Memphis@YoungNBA Erik Spoelstra led the Miami Heat to the #1 seed with zero All NBA players, 1 All star reserve, and his four best players missed a combined 85 games due to injuries, and the team has 4 undrafted players in their regular rotation. This was his best coaching year yet
The disrespect@MiamiHEAT The whole damn team cant play@shevin_141 @EliotShorrParks Well I watched the game. Miami can't defend the sixers with Embiid out there and they can't hit threes. Oh and BTW Embiid gonna be Embiid in game five because of this wack ass slight. I kinda feel bad for the heat. Embiid is cool. That  PER couldn't save Jokic tho.He home  🤣🤷🏿‍♂️@john1083478108 @TrolledByJimmy @MiamiHEAT @PIayoffHerro @HoopsWitHerro LmaoSpo robbed of Coach of the Year #MiamiHeat@JrueBurnerAcct @sixers @MiamiHEAT sixers bucks match up would be good tbh@MiamiHEAT Just fucking win tmr on I will kmsYeahhhh I am @MiamiHEAT https://t.co/YF5QCkUKkHAnd now we have 3 guys who can have 15 carries a game… try stopping a fresh RB in the 4th in 90 degree Miami heat in the fall https://t.co/szuNaymk2UYo @PatMcAfeeShow @nickmaraldo #Nickyskates

No we can’t take this!@dout_16 @miamiheatles55 @MiamiHEAT “worth a shot” lmao like y’all down 3-0. it’s a best of 3 with 2 games at home. make little adjustments and the heat will be fine. this is why y’all aren’t coaches@MiamiHEAT He needs to score.. assist will come naturally..@MiamiHEAT So that means Duncan is playing? Woohoo!@HardyRadio Miami Heat. An incredibly arrogant organization.@MiamiHEAT Need some merch soon !@Brittalexis25 Miami heat and humidity… ground and pound it.

Heat won both games w/Embiid out. Lost both games an injured Embiid played. Nuggets are 11-17 when Jokic is out. He's 2x MVP and would trade them both for a ring. Embiid gets triple teamed and better defender but Jokic is MVP. Fans care more than Joel &amp; Jokic do@wuffalowillss @NBA @MiamiHEAT @JimmyButler Butler literally get contact.@20minuteBoka @MiamiHEAT Fair point.“The New RZA” single off of my next EP drops this Friday 👐🏽🍾
