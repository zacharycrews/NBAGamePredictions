Cole has played really well. A lot better than anyone expected. It is hard this early in a rebuild to figure out who is a keeper and what stuff is real. Ultimately, no rebuild works unless you find that star to build around. Maybe that is Cole, maybe it isn‚Äôt.@OMagicDaily @jonathanigoat @TheMightyA2 @MikeAScotto @hoopshype @usatodaynba @usatodaysports @OrlandoMagic @The_ColeAnthony @Magic_PR @br_orlandomagic @Iam1Cent @GregAnthony50 @KnicksNation He did. Great point. I never meant any direspect. The Knicks had 2 ok seasons in the last 23 years. Orlando had a great run with Dwight and Co. not on Twitter to clash. Just making the point that Cole would be a great PG for us. And we passed on him.@jonathanigoat @TheMightyA2 @MikeAScotto @hoopshype @usatodaynba @usatodaysports @OrlandoMagic @The_ColeAnthony @Magic_PR @OMagicDaily @br_orlandomagic @Iam1Cent @GregAnthony50 @KnicksNation I‚Äôm not talking shit.
