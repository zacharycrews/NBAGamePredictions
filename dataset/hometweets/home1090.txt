@tiffstreats | #MFFL https://t.co/iBZWlarTJlHappy birthday to My coach @RealJasonKidd for the @dallasmavs@Apexx_Gamer As a Dallas Maverick fan, I loved having Shawn Marion on the team.  I also made my son close his eyes when we watched and he was shooting because I didn’t want my son to pick up bad shooting form from Shawn…haha.  He had the worst shooting form ever!!  But loved the results!NBA 🇺🇸 :

If the @dallasmavs beat the @HoustonRockets tonight and the @MiamiHEAT beat the @warriors, the Mavs would be 45-28 and G. St. would fall to 47-26.

https://t.co/wxW9Tv03Ng@dallasmavs I’m super jealous@dallasmavs  in Charlotte, only Luca plays alone. Rest of team members didn't play hard. It is not fair.@natearc38604738 @luka7doncic The Dallas Mavericks are my hobby.With the playoffs set to start in less than a month, the @dallasmavs know they have more than held their own against the best teams the NBA has to offer.
https://t.co/NCkj9RUgdi https://t.co/zSm0VRNEud@Leo30Messi10 @JackMoney14 @SeeSawRrr @josh111520 @getnickwright The 1995 Rockets only won 47 games and won the title. The 2007 Dallas Mavericks won 67 games and lost in the playoff first round. This proves that regular season wins are far less indicative of a team's strength than their record of wins in the postseason.@C4mpyy Jason Terry. 2011 Dallas Mavericks.@MavsPR @dallasmavs I’m so excited to go with my 18 yr old son..praying he doesn’t read/hear that Luka is out 🤦🏻.
