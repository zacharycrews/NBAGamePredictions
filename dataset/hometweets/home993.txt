Harden and Embiid should not rest against the Disney characters magic team in Orlando Sunday! Orlando might need extra police for that game to protect the sixers fans booing markelle fultz down there lol.Check out my latest piece on the @sixers falling to the @BrooklynNets and what they need to do as they prepare for the @OrlandoMagic on Sunday night. #NBA #76ers #Nets #Magic #Phillysports #Trusttheprocess #HereTheyCome https://t.co/GIAzJjFejP@NoHustleSports Open to trading for Orlando Magic, Raiders, Pokemon holos or potentially whatever else you may have available to trade. https://t.co/uj3hQWCkDQ@TerrenceRoss The type of fans the Orlando Magic deserves.We will therefore have to react in two days at @OrlandoMagic because tonight we were of an incredible level of nullity especially from my guy @JHarden13 defensively and offensively we were simply destroyed by a good team !! #SixersNation 😉😀👊💪👍🏀 https://t.co/XAxoSciHra@OrlandoMagic @The_ColeAnthony @jalensuggs @franzboogie @NBAAllStar fb you ain’t drakeAlso @OrlandoMagic I’m sorry it had to be you next :( poor guys https://t.co/BdXbveRWCg@LakelandMagic @devin_cannady3 @nbagleague @PrincetonMBB @OrlandoMagic Sign him @OrlandoMagicGood news: the next game is against the Orlando MagicWatch the Sixers blow out the Orlando Magic next game... Smh lol@360Hyp3rDunk @OrlandoMagic @MountainDew @NBAHistory @Ballislife Better then pierce not garnett@AmySandSand @Jason_Garcia @Disney Yep, the Disney Park would be absolutely flourishing in New York during the months when it's 0 - 50 degrees. The Magic Kingdom (1 of 4 Disney parks in Orlando) is 40 square miles, so a "Sun Dome" is not an option.He’ll pile up these incredible stats against teams like the orlando magic and such then soon as you turn on the lights he’s nowhere to be found.. he’ll try to come off ass confident and nonchalant but he really shittin the bed https://t.co/WutMDUc7tmHarden would ghost against big teams, then score 50pts against Detroit pistons and Orlando magic. Very overrated player LolReady for the next game against the Orlando MagicNew listing!

 Most of the rides  at Magic Kingdom and Hollywood Studios I can find here in California.  We also have the San Diego zoo and safari park about an hour from Disneyland.Sixers are the Orlando Magic without them free throws 🥱At some point I need KD on like the Orlando magic just doing a 2006 Kobe impression, taking 40 shots in a gameMagic Taken Down by Hot-Shooting Hawks https://t.co/TmHmtzd5Do via @OrlandoMagic@LakotaGoku @YouCntGuardMe_ @kobehighlight Where was Lebron when Kobe was in the finals? Oh wait...losing to Rashard Lewis and the Orlando MagicIf white chocolate is talking about an entire career of laker greats then it might make more sense.
