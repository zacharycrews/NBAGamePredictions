The fact that we are at last years play offs, where LD takes ball for 21 seconds per attack, is sad. Today he was shooting good. Tommorow? Next 5 games?A little look at the Mavs great defense:

The Mavericks have won 10 of their last 11 games, holding their opponent to under 100 points in 8 of those games.

Dallas has also limited their opponents to under 50.0% shooting in 21 consecutive games.

Late-game defense has been key for the Mavs' recent fourth quarter success with a staggering 90.4 defensive rating (1st) during this stretch.@galszs @AndresMffl @statmuse @luka7doncic @dallasmavs Luka is also averaging more points, assists, rebounds, steals, and blocks.

THE DALLAS MAVERICKS ARE 9-1 IN THE YEAR OF 2022 🔥 https://t.co/ETFY2g8D5XThe Dallas Mavericks are 10-1 in their previous 11 games. They have produced a 90.4 defensive rating (1st) in fourth quarters during this stretch.

Dragic is a mentor and friend to Mavericks superstar Luka Doncic.
