But because of the talent and season luka is the only guy in the league avg 26/9/9 IN THE WHOLE LEAGUE. Even jokic &amp; giannis aren't avg that.@sishaaver @jcollins20_ @ATLHawks It goes back to Trae and the recent offensive surge goes back to guys like Delon and Lou stepping up off the bench whenever Trae is resting so that this offense is able to maintain similar potency the whole gameConsensus Line Move:

#NBA #bet #programmer #stocks@KevinKeneely1 @jcollins20_ @ATLHawks Sure.  Not saying it yet.  But you see some very crude things to build on.  His improved ft shooting percentage is extremely positive to see.  You can see a lot more offensive confidence than even last year and he's hardly played.@sishaaver @jcollins20_ @ATLHawks Here is OO‚Äôs shot chart compared to John‚Äôs this season https://t.co/wjZtYASSIH@unknownburner1 @rayfordyoung @NBA @TheTraeYoung @JaMorant @ATLHawks @memgrizz Luka avg 26/9/9 and ja does 26/5/6 tell me who's having a better season?

Tells me almost nothing other than I could draw a fungible conclusion.  Really kind of gets back to Trae.  I've always maintained Trae and a bunch of jerseys will have a good offense unless you're just giving him complete non shooters and no space.@thetruthinsport @rayfordyoung @NBA @TheTraeYoung @JaMorant @ATLHawks @memgrizz Suns have a better record and Booker stats are identical to ja so what's the point here? luka is on a different level than ja and that's not even a question.@sishaaver @jcollins20_ @ATLHawks OO would have to develop a jump shot first. OO has never made a shot outside of the paint and he‚Äôs only attempted one shot outside of the paint this season aloneAtlanta hawks vs everybody #atlantahawks lets goooo @ATLHawks@KevinKeneely1 @jcollins20_ @ATLHawks Frankly I can see OO being better on the 15 foot pop jumper off the PnR than John is in two years.@KevinKeneely1 @jcollins20_ @ATLHawks Agree see my follow up tweet. Though I think part of what Travis is thinking is that OO could potentially shoot enough to be a four.  Maybe not from three,  but his touch is nice out to 15 feet.@KevinKeneely1 @ATL_The_MVP @jcollins20_ @ATLHawks I'd like to see this trend over the next 10 games.  OO played five games and is just developing his offense.@sishaaver @jcollins20_ @ATLHawks They play different positions so it would be more like what is the offensive efficiency with Gallo instead of John and then the offensive efficiency of OO instead of Capela@sishaaver @ATL_The_MVP @jcollins20_ @ATLHawks OO is less of a shot creator than John.

Protect the rim and board.  Spread the floor on offense and wait your turn.  And support Trae, don't undermine him.@KevinKeneely1 @jcollins20_ @ATLHawks and it's got be lower than Gallo@KevinKeneely1 @jcollins20_ @ATLHawks What's the efficiency with OO instead of John.@KevinKeneely1 @ATL_The_MVP @jcollins20_ @ATLHawks And every time he starts talking about his role makes it more likely he's getting traded.  He needs to stop whining and figure out how to help the team in other ways especially defensively.  He's already gotten paid.@ATLHawks @StateFarm I take it Jake was out sick@sishaaver @jcollins20_ @ATLHawks The offensive efficiency is that good because of John, not the other way around. If he wasn‚Äôt on this team and apart of this offense it wouldn‚Äôt be as good. Giving John more touches would only make their offense even betterYesterday we stopped by Bessie Branham with our friends from @StateFarm to create vision boards with the kids! 

We are dedicated to helping our local youth dream big ü§© https://t.co/U3CkgKWiu4@KevinKeneely1 @ATL_The_MVP @jcollins20_ @ATLHawks No it's not.  It's a small size and if John could actually generate more shots he would.  He's not a creator and lives off other guys stuff.  He's a fine player but he needs to adjust his game to the team. I'd like to see him play more like OO frankly.  He needs to more physical@KevinKeneely1 @jcollins20_ @ATLHawks Again why should we be running one additional shot for John when our offensive efficiency is number one in the league already.  I get it.  Let's not trade John, but don't tell me John made a huge difference the first 35 games of the year b/c he didn't.  He needs to fit inI‚Äôm a @MiamiHEAT fan but @ATLHawks I love this!

#sportsbetting #betting #sportspicks #gamblingtwitter #gambling@CHISportsFann @Ohh_Hai_Mark @TheTraeYoung @ATLHawks I personally don‚Äôt think team standings shouldn‚Äôt impact a player‚Äôs chance of making/starting an All-Star game. I think it should strictly be based off their impact. Yes, the Hawks are 3 games under .500 but Trae‚Äôs stats show that if he wasn‚Äôt there they‚Äôd be 10+ games under .500@Ohh_Hai_Mark @KevinKeneely1 @TheTraeYoung @ATLHawks That‚Äôs exactly my point. It‚Äôs inconsistent. I‚Äôm not saying he doesn‚Äôt deserve to be an all star, but starting is a tough sell. Especially when good players previously have been left off entirely because the team sucks. Just my two cents@ATL_The_MVP @sishaaver @jcollins20_ @ATLHawks The Hawks offense is at their best actually whenever John is taking shots. The offense has received a boost these last few games because of the bench. Delon and Lou each have offensive ratings of 140+ since January 14. Their playmaking and scoring off the bench has been huge@sishaaver @KevinKeneely1 @jcollins20_ @ATLHawks That would be true, if John shot 32% from 3.@sishaaver @jcollins20_ @ATLHawks Trae &amp; this team are at their best whenever he‚Äôs got guys like Huerter/Bogi out there that can also make plays for others. The wings also provide much better off-ball offense and defense that helps open up better looks on offense and allow the Hawks to be smoother in transitionüíØConsensus Line Move:
2022-01-28 Boston Celtics at Atlanta Hawks from 218.50 to 219.50

#NBA #CryptoHoops #dataanalyst #businessowner@OleTimeHardball Such an amazing athlete.  Drafted by @Padres @Vikings @ATLHawks and, old-timers will remember, the Carolina Cougars of the ABA!According to a 2021 survey, the Atlanta Hawks have the sixth-most attractive fanbase in NBA. 

Falcons, Braves named most attractive NFL, MLB. 

No surprise there.

https://t.co/uiS7EXh3cZ@KevinKeneely1 @ATL_The_MVP @jcollins20_ @ATLHawks and we'd be losing seventy games.  Are you kidding.  Our offense is number one in the league last five games.  In no world should John be taking shots from Trae, Hunter or any of our other options.  John's best role is to become a hustle guy and enforcer.Congratulations Trae Young‚ÄºÔ∏è

Plus, Trae doesn‚Äôt have a DeRozan/Lavine playing next to him to make things easier. 

Trae all the wayCongratulations to @atlhawks star @TheTraeYoung on being named a 2022 #NBAAllStar starter! 

I spoke with Hawks star Trae Young about the reports of his interest to play in the 3point contest during NBA All-Star weekend.

We now know he will be playing in the big game! https://t.co/j7nQxKF4cA@RedVelvetMelon @armills122 @NBAonTNT @TheTraeYoung @ATLHawks We‚Äôll see@HawksOnBally @Traeyoung @TheTraeYoung @ATLHawks @BobRathbunTV @DWilkins21 @laurenjbara @TreavorScales @Kelly_Crull @mrvincecarter15 @ReneeMontgomery @moniquebillings WTF THE @The haters need to look at some stat sheets.
