Garland is fantastic about running the offense, but we only had one guy who could go get a bucket. We aren’t better without sexton. That’s a terrible take. There’s been multiple games where we desperately needed him@MotorCityHoops @kirkgoldsberry @cavs @Timberwolves @memgrizz @celtics @BrooklynNets @nyknicks @Lakers @trailblazers @Raptors @chicagobulls @detroitbadboys @DetroitKoolAid Definitely!

It let Garland be Garland. Which leaves the Cavs in an interesting position – Sexton's an RFA this summer (I think). Also, they now also have LeVert.@KPRiley10 @kirkgoldsberry @cavs @Timberwolves @memgrizz @celtics @BrooklynNets @nyknicks @Lakers @trailblazers @Raptors @chicagobulls No it's an example of a team careing more about the postseason and allowing there stars to rest to avoid previous injuries that had previously stopped themI think the #Texans should lean into “bully ball”.

You got an agenda vs Ja. Anyways… He doesn’t shoot too much for a PG, that’s just what the game has evolved into. Trae and Luka take a lot of shots too and look how far the Hawks made it last year. It’s not an issue.@Big_MacJr @CamthomasTakes @JohnsonSanyah @GrizzliesPR @memgrizz @BrooklynNets @JaMorant Yes KD meant it wtf… if he didn’t , he wouldn’t have said it.
