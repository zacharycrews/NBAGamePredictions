[FD(66.2) DK(65.5)]@BrooklynNets The Nets finally play a good team and get exposed for the trash team they are. By the way, the Raptors are the best team in the NBA. They don’t need good playmakers and a good head coach to win games. Enjoy watching the Toronto Raptors dominate the NBA finals this year.#BrooklynNets - #TorontoRaptors 97:133
