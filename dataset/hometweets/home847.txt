Great pod!@3Clicksinvest Glad he got in a situation where everything aligned for him. Fingers crossed that he makes a finals appearance a la 1998 Tiger year Jordan.

Kanter doesn't strike me as someone who can have a similar role as a center. He'll probably rebound more than Bjelica but he's a more traditional C and I'm not sure of the fit.@Boness305 @NBA @Lakers @warriors did u forget about the playoffs being included or no? they only made a big deal for the 3pt record without the playoffs counting. as for any other record.@DogSurfRoadshow @dieter @LockedOnDubs @KlayThompson @warriors @Lakers I also don’t think Wiseman has 0 value… Wouldn’t the Spurs have done something like Poetl and Lonnie Walker for Wiseman, Bjeli, and pick 29@ABiS0Laaa @d_bookied @NBA @Lakers @warriors 🧘 is alright@DogSurfRoadshow @LockedOnDubs @dieter @KlayThompson @warriors @Lakers Claxton and M Rob could have been traded straight up for say DLee. 1st would be sweetener.
