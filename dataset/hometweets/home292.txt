remember? =PThe Atlanta Hawks won seven games in a row. All seven games have been blowouts.

In their last two games they're in the 98th percentile in points per possession (133.7 and 133.3).

Also.. Trae is 1 free throw away from a 50-40-90 shooting split in their 7 game winning streak. 🏳️@nyknicks fans are excited for tonight's revenge match against @TheTraeYoung @ATLHawks but are the players?

I’m a big Hunter fan btw, bur maybe they really are better without him. Thoughts? https://t.co/x7mhQslMupTrae Young in 27 minutes last night:

✅ 31 PTS
✅ 10 AST
✅ 12-16 FG

Only three players since the ABA-NBA merger have recorded a 30p/10a game in less playing time.

The @ATLHawks have won seven straight games by 10 or more points, the longest such streak in franchise history. https://t.co/3fb5xraHHHAtlanta Hawks look unstoppable at this point of the season. Seven straight wins, two straight wins on the road and still counting.

They enjoy to play the game and have fun as a team.

Hi @ATLHawks @TheTraeYoung you figures are improving in the score, but the followers of your best worldwide my friend @Alberto_W21 no.
So pls. Open his Twitter profile and press “Follow” he deserves it.
Go ahead@AltonBailey9 @NBA @ATLHawks @cam He just needs to finish better at the Rim, and the Hawks need to stop isolating him to the corner.  He’s better with the ball in his hands.  He also needs to be more aggressive in the paint.

Jersey sales have nothing to do with the meh home crowd or low opinion of scouts, coaches, opposing players, and analysts around the NBA@dunk99who @ATLHawks Nate cool but capela too inconsistent. He's been playing well but u know he gone revert back to bullshit soon@TheSaintsSuck @RobespierreMil2 @Crimson_D_23 @NBA @ATLHawks Oh I know, I’m just having some fun.

This isn't the 90s. Besides children, Who wears jerseys nowadays anyway? If you put Lamelo or Ja in this town, you'd see the difference immediately@RobespierreMil2 @Crimson_D_23 @NBA @ATLHawks Considering he’s 8th in jersey sales in the NBA I think he’s pretty popular 😂 https://t.co/XE8pcEEbL2Latest: Preliminary imaging revealed Memphis Grizzlies star Ja Morant suffered a left knee sprain in the first quarter of Friday night's 132-100 home loss to the Atlanta Hawks, according to the Memphis Grizzlies. https://t.co/Cg33uNXahz@SLAMonline @ATLHawks #IceTrae took almost the toughest shot he could take at the end of a quarter. He could easily have driven to the basket for the automatic teardrop. Instead he goes for the step-back 30 footer. 
What a competitor.@AustinPlanet @Crimson_D_23 @NBA @ATLHawks It doesn't happen in places like Memphis, Chicago, Boston, Philly Miami, Dallas or Milwaukee etc. Simply put, Trae Young doesn't move the needle in Atlanta. Stop making excuses for his lack of popularity.@RobespierreMil2 @Crimson_D_23 @NBA @ATLHawks I’m pretty sure Steph, LeBron, KD get a bigger reaction than the star of every team they play lol@AustinPlanet @Crimson_D_23 @NBA @ATLHawks No, the Hawks made the Conference Finals last year. NOBODY should be able to come into that building and get a bigger reception than Trae, but it happens all of the time. That doesn't happen to Jimmy Butler, Ja Morant, Embiid, or even Lamelo at home.🏀NBA🏀 #NBA
