There’s really only 1 difference. One team was ranked 15th in defense and the other is ranked 27th. Defense wins championships folks, that’s just a Fact.@MikeBellATL @DukesandBell929 @eastlakegc @ATLHawks @AtlantaFalcons @MLB Damn you boys have it rough@ATL_Survivor @MikeBellATL @ATLHawks @TheTraeYoung @jcollins20_ Let’s not forget the Hawks we’re out for a month in December and had to play with guys on 10 day contracts due to Covid.

Their scorer knew. And I promise someone on that bench was keeping stats and knew the numbers didn't add up. They took the points anyway.@gehrigknapp_4 @OfficialGHSA @ATLHawks @BSNSPORTS_GA @WilsonBasktball @NFHSNetwork @GoFanHS The scorer and coaches at Drew also are culpable. The scorer knew there was an issue. 

And I promise you Drew had someone on staff keeping stats that also knew the score was wrong. They knew it and went along with it.@jhhenslee @d_jackson_10 @OfficialGHSA @BSNSPORTS_GA @NFHSNetwork @GPBsports @ATLHawks @WilsonBasktball @GoFanHS Right????@NTNabawi @OfficialGHSA @BSNSPORTS_GA @NFHSNetwork @GPBsports @ATLHawks @WilsonBasktball @GoFanHS Drew probably got gifted points again and went along with it@NTNabawi @OfficialGHSA @BSNSPORTS_GA @NFHSNetwork @GPBsports @ATLHawks @WilsonBasktball @GoFanHS @DrewEaglesBBall And I can't express my disgust enough that they were in this game in the first place.@OfficialGHSA @BSNSPORTS_GA @NFHSNetwork @GPBsports @ATLHawks @WilsonBasktball @GoFanHS If you have these in the semis, the points scored by each player don't equal the number the team is shown to have. And we have a whole different scenario. But y'all don't care about integrity. It's pathetic.@ModernWoodmen65 @VlogsMali @OfficialGHSA @BSNSPORTS_GA @WilsonBasktball @NFHSNetwork @GPBsports @ATLHawks @GoFanHS Yes they did. Their scorer knew they had been given two extra points and could have insisted to the ref that the official book be corrected. Instead, they went along with it and refused to do the right thing. By changing their book, they left SC's scorer high &amp; dry.@cedtaylor1911 @SavageSpartan95 @OfficialGHSA @BSNSPORTS_GA @WilsonBasktball @NFHSNetwork @GPBsports @ATLHawks @GoFanHS @SocialCircleBSB Not according to the rules of basketball@Bernie27331501 @caramayfield2 @OfficialGHSA @BSNSPORTS_GA @WilsonBasktball @NFHSNetwork @GPBsports @ATLHawks @GoFanHS Their scorer knew the official book was wrong and didn't have the integrity to make sure it got changed. In fact, they did the opposite and knowingly went along with it.ALERT: New high roller bet posted!

On One hand Hawks fans keep seeing Sharife Cooper go for 30 points over &amp; over again

On the other hand we keep seeing Hawks lose important games

In the whole series he passed up multiple dunk opportunities &amp; never scored in the 4th quarter.
