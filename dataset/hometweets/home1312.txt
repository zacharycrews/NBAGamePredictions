Warriors are back in Dallas to try and close out this series, will they bring out the brooms for a sweep? Or will Dallas hold them off for another game in the bay area?

55% of the money on Dallas even though only 42% of the bets are on Dallas. +13% in the splits is very good sign. Also have sharp action on Dallas, backs against the wall down 3-0, and GS having lost the last few closeout games.

Then, the Cowboys bought him in 1995.@CraftyCCoyote @FactsServedCold @gmalin7994 @dallasmavs @Chime Read the first part of what you just commented onüòÇ. He should of never mentioned 94.

#NBATwitter #MFFLIf you were curious, my research turned this up: the Mavericks are actually tied with the Warriors for the fewest points ever scored in a quarter since 1954. On April 6, 1997, Dallas scored only two points. Golden State accomplished the two-point quarter on Feb. 8, 2004.@KuttBet ‚Ä¢The 2016 Cleveland Cavaliers ‚Äî Lebron James

On April 6, 1997, Dallas scored only two points.

And 12-win NFL seasons definitely put you in good position.This week Josh Green and the @dallasmavs began their Western Conference finals series with the @warriors. While Josh Giddey and Matisse Thybulle were named in the All-Rookie and All-Defensive teams to cap off our Aussies in the #NBA.
