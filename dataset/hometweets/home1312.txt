He can apply pressure as a slasher in both the full and half court. His quickness helps him rotate on the defensive end. The Mavs have to match the Warriors on both ends at the start this game.

The NBA has 16 teams in East &amp; West Conf, totaling 32. If Mavs season ends tonite, they will be ranked 4th among the world's best 32 basketball teams. Who'd a thunk that when the season began. GO MAVS, keep fightin.@NBAonTNT @dallasmavs @warriors Will there be minute of silence to today's shooting of 14 kids and 1 teacher?MY #Mavericks @ #Warriors SAME GAME PARLAY!

Warriors are back in Dallas to try and close out this series, will they bring out the brooms for a sweep? Or will Dallas hold them off for another game in the bay area? 

Smash Like ❤ if you need a play for this game!! https://t.co/ftcLXokftAMavericks -1; .75units to win .68

55% of the money on Dallas even though only 42% of the bets are on Dallas. +13% in the splits is very good sign. Also have sharp action on Dallas, backs against the wall down 3-0, and GS having lost the last few closeout games.

🏀🏀🏀 Dallas Mavericks, Money line -110 🏀🏀🏀Just because they said no one has been able to survive from a 3-0 win doesnt mean you should just go to sleep on it... There would be a first time for that, what if you are the first team to do that... It wouldnt take soft plays to achieve that... Strong defense @dallasmavs lego@dallasmavs @AACenter This game should be suspended@dtxscarlett @dallasmavs @AACenter They probably will. It takes time to do something like that so it’s short notice. I live in Denver and went to the Nuggets playoff game on May 7 when the STEM shooting happened. The Nuggets put together a beautiful tribute that night. Made me tear up during the pregameFor sure a bummer how bad he played last time out, but he has had a significant impact in our run so I can’t bash him too much. I think he’ll give us one more solid game tonight, and we can at least avoid the sweep.

Many have taken out the broomsticks and have written off the Dallas Mavericks. With Luka's rep on the line, can he conjure up enough magic to take one game, or will he still be haunted by Wiggins posterizing him? #nba #GSWvsMAVS #lukadoncic #StephenCurryI believe in you @dallasmavs

#Warriors #Mavericks #NBATwitterThe Mavericks have won the Shot Quality battle 3-0 this series, yet they’re down 0-3. 

Biggest difference this series: Shot making. Dallas has died by the three. Sometimes is that simple. It’s a make or miss league, and the Mavs have missed a ton of shots.

It would be even higher if the Dubs can put a little more effort in by stopping those 2ND chance points that Dallas gets@GregFieldsWX I see that you are keeping it real the Dallas Mavericks cannot come back from that deficit I just hope they don't get swept no brooms in the American AirlinesGAME 4-- WHAT DO YOU THINK? How confident are you that the @dallasmavs can do what no NBA team has done before; overcome a 3 game deficit to make it to the NBA Finals?@iBrolyGreen @AnthraxProject @Swaggernaut64 @MAGA_MATTHEW @YuhLilMike @dallasmavs @mcuban Before I answer, what’s your strategy? Do nothing? Be happy with getting swept out and clearly being an inferior team? Continue running a team that has zero forwards or centers that can score? 3-point specialists who can only hit wide-open shots with no pressure is not scoring.@muse1116 @luka7doncic @dallasmavs @mcuban Do you have a shirt when you get swept by the Warriors ?Any time the Dallas Mavericks are mentioned it should include the line "active human traffickers" https://t.co/UHXL4WSZP1Eight people have been arrested in Oklahoma City for allegedly trafficking a 15-year-old Texas girl, who was abducted at a Dallas Mavericks game last month when she left her father to go and use the bathroom.

Anyone missing ?My Dallas Mavericks got me like… https://t.co/6JaQ5sHbzTMaybe it's true that us, as a Dallas Mavericks fans, need to wait one more year before we can reach the NBA Finals.

Keep maintain our expectation and don't turn toxic like those GS fans.@dallasmavs Hey it's over, we all know it. To have come this far was definitely unexpected by most &amp; a enjoyable time. This squad brought some good times to the city (not The City as in San Francisco). Hopefully the Mavs can be back &amp; better next season. #MFFL@dallasmavs already used my jersey to wipe my dogs ass@dallasmavs Clear dog whistle.

Then, the Cowboys bought him in 1995.@CraftyCCoyote @FactsServedCold @gmalin7994 @dallasmavs @Chime Read the first part of what you just commented on😂. He should of never mentioned 94. All I was doing was making fun of him for saying cowboys won in 94Deandre Ayton's agent: 'We're disappointed. We wanted a max contract' I would not give Aytons no max deal he needs to be traded or released he quit on the Sun's when they played the seven game against Dallas Mavericks he's not worth that kind of money let him go@ShibnobiStrong @RyanSAdams @Shib_nobi @dallasmavs @dak @NFL @NBA @ebenet @JesseKove @MartinKove I am blocked on telegram.

The Warriors own your pathetic franchise! Cool Luka put up 40 but just like @deadlymixx said “ would he be happier to drop 40 or win the game”! You’re to scared to face reality that your team is a joke. So if I were you I would get off Twitter cause you lost!@LakeShowYo @dallasmavs I think this would be interesting but in the end Westbrook is too ball dominant to work in the system.

#NBATwitter #MFFLIf you were curious, my research turned this up: the Mavericks are actually tied with the Warriors for the fewest points ever scored in a quarter since 1954. On April 6, 1997, Dallas scored only two points. Golden State accomplished the two-point quarter on Feb. 8, 2004.@KuttBet •The 2016 Cleveland Cavaliers — Lebron James
•The 2014 San Antonio Spurs — Tony Parker
•The 2011 Dallas Mavericks — Dirk

Missed a few. Oops 11 in total@JayScottSmith According to my research: the Mavericks are actually tied with the Warriors for the fewest points ever scored in a quarter since 1954. On April 6, 1997, Dallas scored only two points. Golden State accomplished the two-point quarter on Feb. 8, 2004.@dallasmavs @BrittanyLynne @PatrickMahomes Y’all are a beautiful couple!!Pat.I started collecting your shoes and it’s become a fun hobby.I’m so siked for your next color wave to come out.Looks like maybe your wearing a sneak peek!Your an inspiration to my family.

And 12-win NFL seasons definitely put you in good position.This week Josh Green and the @dallasmavs began their Western Conference finals series with the @warriors. While Josh Giddey and Matisse Thybulle were named in the All-Rookie and All-Defensive teams to cap off our Aussies in the #NBA.
