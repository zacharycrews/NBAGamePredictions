Basketball. NBANBA - Memphis Grizzlies' Ja Morant suffered left knee sprain in loss, team says https://t.co/1oZnfHrlCAAs a @memgrizz fan it hurts to lose @JaMorant for any amount of time. But I could only imagine how much it’s hurting him to be away from the floor. The dude loves the game, loves Memphis, and loves his teammates so much and you saw it game in and game out. Prayers up 12.@JaMorant @memgrizz One of these? https://t.co/0TyD9XdqPvMemphis is giving away FREE Memphis Grizzlies basketball tickets to people who get the jab!!

https://t.co/ZJuZnDOusL via @DeepnightpressEu realmente gosto do Memphis Grizzlies@GrizzliesPR @memgrizz @SacramentoKings Melton, Bane, Dillon, Kyle, Jaren. Kyle plays point forward and I want Melton defending point guards. I have no doubt Taylor Jenkins is going to screw up the lineups and rotation.

OUT
Sam Merrill - LT Ankle Sprain
Ja Morant - LT Knee Sprain✨When Memphis Grizzlies star Ja Morant went down without contact on Friday night and couldn't put weight on his left leg, the worst was feared. An initial MRI showed Morant avoided serious injury &amp; has a sprained left knee.
