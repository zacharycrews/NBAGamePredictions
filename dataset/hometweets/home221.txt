Yeah, don't trust this shit. https://t.co/xkwN6u7OBNOne of Boban’s best games as a Maverick came in the Bubble against the Suns where he had 18 points and 20 rebounds. Historically, Phoenix has killed the Mavs with smaller lineups and shooting. Two ways to counter that

1.) Also go small
2.) Boban@RooshWilliams Look how fluid the Phoenix Suns offense looks with CP3.....its not rushed he putting guys in position to score...I don't care what nobody says KPJ aint the answer at the PG position you move him to the 2 and slide green at the 3..Augustine the only true PG they got that I see@garret_hose7 do the Phoenix Suns not exist anymoreNowPlaying Sun Drifting the Phoenix Coast and the Man Eating Probability - Wave Temples https://t.co/X4qtYyw4B7 16:31I ain't the phoenix suns but m tryna get my D.ayton by youCALLING ALL ARIZONA @TESLA OWNERS AND ENTHUSIASTS
