With that selection, #RBNY takes Matthew Nocita from the United States Naval Academy.Complicated trade here to see RBNY get up to No. 7.

Chicago Fire took a timeout before their selection, and now the New York Red Bulls have taken a timeout as well.
Today I learned that is an option...
#SuperDraftNikola Vucevic said that when the Chicago Bulls traded for him "it sent a message throughout the league that Chicago is serious about winning now and it attracted other players."

Vucevic called Billy Donovan a great coach.

Warriors are great no doubt. But they don‚Äôt play defense the way the Chicago Bulls did.

Every video and interview I see of him makes me like him more. I know Chicago has a good thing going right now, but Giannis is so likable, I want him in a Bulls uniform one day.Play like Jordan, 
party like Rodman.

 Also, he'd be much easier to get for a mostly-set Chicago team than his fellow Piston Grant or Sac's Harrison Barnes@cfcguy10 @chicagobulls One loss.  We move on.  Zach and Demar have earned their right to take shots.  Those shots are still all good looks.  Even Vooch‚Äôs shots.  It was an off night all around for the team.  Shots didn‚Äôt fall.
