If he takes a buyout from the Rockets, does he pay Texas state taxes on the buyout? Then play elsewhere and save a lot of $$$ on taxes? May make sense to take a lower % of remaining deal.@HoustonRockets @hornets @ATTSportsNetSW @SportsTalk790 GIVE J WALL MINUTES@HoustonRockets @hornets @ATTSportsNetSW @SportsTalk790 LETS GET THIS WI'm sure Houston would love to waive Wall...provided he gives back a sizable chunk of money in a buyout.

He's not going to do that, nor should he feel it necessary.

His confidence in his 3pt shot is a really good sign. He can play a little bully ball as well.

Putting on for the city 👏🏾If these previous games haven’t shown you Jokic is the mvp idk what will. We’re on a 4 game losing streak without him and have been blown out in 3/4 of them.
