Down by 20 at home at halftime.  Kawhi doesn't get hurt there is an argument the Spurs beat the Warriors that series@thehalestone At the end of the day, most "stars" don't want to be in San Antonio. I like Jak, but I agree, the roster needs improvement clearly. We can hope that things go well in the off season but I have much less faith then most optimistic Spurs fans. I also don't trust that front office.Consensus Line Move:

Derrick White is attainable though.San Antonio Spurs: Rebuilding the Arizona Wildcats https://t.co/1tJX6YaaS3@DeanRyder9 @Suns San Antonio shot NBA record percentages from 3 in the finals, golden state was the most stacked team in history. And he had to play the 2007 spurs whom were stacked with boobie Gibson as his best teammate. The only finals you can really blame him for is 2011.@DeanRyder9 @Suns Those spurs and warriors teams he faced were arguably the two best offenses of all time in terms of efficiency. He‚Äôs 1-0 against Miami, 1-0 against OKC. He only has a losing record in the finals to golden state and San Antonio which those teams likely would‚Äôve beaten anybody
