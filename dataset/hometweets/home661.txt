They're actually 3rd in the NBA in offense (113.5 PPG), but 29th in defense (allowing 115). Down from 17th last season.

Collins Cut. https://t.co/AwSJzS2TMh via @YouTube@DakotaHappas @ATLHawks @celtics @BCCoachStevens @SwingJuice With Collins wanting out of Atlanta as it is, I think his is a smart move. I do think you need to throw in at least 1 first Rd Pick, maybe 2 given how young  Collins is. Im not 100% sure theyd take the trade though, even with the 2 lottery picksLast week, the Atlanta Hawks traded forward Cam Reddish to the New York Knicks.

The former lottery pick has plenty of potential — will he breakout in the Big Apple?
