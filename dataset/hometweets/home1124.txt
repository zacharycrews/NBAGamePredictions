Bet slip link: https://t.co/Lf2QLaF580 https://t.co/DVAHBNmfz3@hhpthebook @nyknicks Randle holds onto the ball far too much. He tries to dribble through 2-3 players. He drives into trouble. He turns the ball over. He needs to pass and cut, take short jumpers, and hit the boards. He must share the dirty work with Mitchell Robinson.

It's not being "real", you're literally wrong lol.Former @AlabamaMBB forward Braxton Key entered Sunday's game with 6 career @NBA points.

#WorldOfSport 
#NBA@DarrellColema20 @hhpthebook @nyknicks Yes, but the idea is to improve the team from bad to a contender and that is a lateral move at best and if Obi doesn’t improve his game they’ll be worse. As frustrating as Randall is to watch he draws a lot of defensive attention@Pparisi515 @rxmeister55 @hhpthebook @nyknicks Obi's impact in the game is better than Randle's impact. Not everything is points and assist. We won easily in the games Randle was out (And to good Playoffs teams). We barely won to the worst team Pistons with Randle (And lost 2 times against magic this year with Randle).@rxmeister55 @hhpthebook @nyknicks Facts, this why I’m thankful nobody on Knicks twitter runs the team#NBA

You said Obi would be a target and that’s not true 
This fan base defended Knox and Frank for years just cause they were home grown 
Obi (who’s actually good at basketball) would never get criticized like Randle 
For one he’s home grown and two 
He’s not a selfish player@hhpthebook @nyknicks Yes agreed but i think Mitchell Robinson will be too expensive to sign.

And I have a feeling he might want out too, although of course none of us know for sure. I just don’t want to move him just for the sake of moving him, he’s a really really good player, the return should be good too.@La_RedStar @nyknicks Sorry@nyknicks @TheGarden @BetMGM I think we gonna win@hhpthebook @nyknicks Randle was a disappointment this season. With Derrick Rose on the court it seems like everyone else plays better. Randle needed Rose for him to play good@hhpthebook @nyknicks Point, I would switch IQ with Deuce...because I think IQ as the hammer coming in with the second unit would give us continuity.  But this could also wait a year as Deuce has to get more confident scoring.  Also Grimes should be in the mix and Jericho as the backup for Mitch.he is BIG he plays on the New York  knicks@hhpthebook @nyknicks I was at the Garden last night for the Rangers.

Especially a player that gives his all like Obi

But it was the early Knicks of the 1990s that brought me to the Knicks. Not only therefore a great book!@De_Italiano @hhpthebook @nyknicks yeah kinda my thinking. i worry about Grimes having to by default guard bigger wings off the bench.

After a 23 point comeback by New Orleans the  Panthers ended up selling this lay!Quickley could be the best player on the team?  He should be the Starting PG!!! Why play Burks there?  Makes no sense. The team is out of the Playoffs.

Tyty is the highest rated PG and he is projected outside the lotto after being terrible in the tournament. Plus he played SG most of the year. That chandlers from Tenn might be higher now at pick 15I'm happy with RJ Barrett's (@RjBarrett6) @NBA performance. He is a factor on the @nyknicks. It was immediately evident to me that he was in an NBA caliber player. I saw the moment he was drafted...@nyknicks typical Knicks getting pointless wins.  The Knicks win when it means nothing.  So all they are doing is ruining there chance to get a good PG in the draft. Why couldn’t this team win when it meant anything?? Why is Julius Randle still playing? One big Riddle!

aka New York Pacers

They never learn@drew73m @JalenRose He's been with the New York Knicks since the start of the season. He was getting good minutes to start the year, but I think he's been benched as of late.@nyknicks 3 IN A  ROW....NEW SHOW IS UP....https://t.co/DAf8ptbM3S@user694200299 @JeffersonMalga @nyknicks Sacramento is the spot to be nowadays! Muhrts really got the city buzzing and the chicks here think MGC is hot 👀 #LeManager@hhpthebook @nyknicks @MSGNetworks @23savage____ Definitely taking a chance and will likely and up with a center that’s older and not as good. Pay Mitch and get rid of Randle!!@hhpthebook @nyknicks @MSGNetworks @23savage____ Sometimes  we don't  agree on this I doWhilst they are in the middle of the Eastern Conference Semifinals, there are rumblings that @JeffersonMalga has become uneasy with his current situation. Speculation is that he will request a trade once the @nyknicks end their season.@triniboy1016 @nyknicks @J30_RANDLE @RjBarrett6 @IQ_GodSon @AlecBurks10 They’ll only get so far as their talent level permits. So all the experience in the world will only take them so far.

Let's go @nyknicks.@BrooklynNets can actually help @nyknicks out by winning the rest of their games. They got a few games we can cheer them on in, especially that @ATLHawks game they have coming up.   #NBA #NBATwitter #LetsGoKnicks #NYKNew York Knicks are bad baby big fan big fan https://t.co/rGzwqoIWKh@nyknicks Whoop de do. As soon as Iso Randle comes back, Thibs will shove him down our throats again. #FireThibsDR. MARK RESPLER, 66, died of COVID on March 27, 2020. 

He was a urologist in Boro Park, New York, and insisted on having a multilingual staff that spoke Yiddish, Hebrew, Creole, and Russian to better serve his patients. He loved the Knicks, Yankees, and Giants. https://t.co/uFsCgt9CgO@nyknicks someone said NY didn't need to get rid of the coach.  the hell they don't that weak eyed goofball sucks as a coach and if it wasn't for Toppin, who this idiot doesn't give a chance, they would be way out@_noires11 @unclefoolio Not gonna happen. He don’t like to play defense either. MF be giving up on the floor. He’s not built for New York. I think he’d be better off on another team and Knicks would be better off without him. He had a great bubble year though.@SBondyNYDN is a clown. The @nyknicks should not allow you to cover anymore games. Go nut hug KD the rest of the season. Lame ass@AfterDarkMarcel @nyknicks @DetroitPistons @Mountaingal456 @KnicksSavage @KnicksNetwork @knicksfancam @skywalker42811 @forevershinin @nbamlb @JamieLK85 @jen_NY25 @AaliyahNevaeh7 @UbelCheryl @smonk318 @GoMets01 Thanks for the tag!
