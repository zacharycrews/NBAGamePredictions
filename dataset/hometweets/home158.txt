But they are playing at a pretty slow pace (25th in NBA) + rank 19th in transition frequency.Howard in Orlando was much different situation, he had did all he could for that magic team and never had a superstar talent there getting them to the finals, and he wasn’t the best free throw shooter but lowkey still had improvements….Howard wasn’t afraid of the big moments https://t.co/XpFHX1MFm5@DavidBaumannORL @OrlandoMagic To make it even weirder:

In the Magic's 11 games, that starting 5 unit has only played together in the 4th quarter in 2 games for a grand total of 9 minutes. https://t.co/20hGYfItazNBA Game Props 11/10/21

-Miles Bridges of the Charlotte Hornets will score over 20.5 points

-Wendell Carter Jr. of the Orlando Magic will have 13 or more total rebounds against the Brooklyn Nets

-Christian Wood of the Houston Rockets will have over 10.5 total rebounds

-Part 1November 10, 1994: New York's Patrick Ewing hits the game-winner against Orlando with 2.4 seconds to go.

Ewing had 24 points in 26 minutes for the Knicks (3-0). Shaquille O'Neal had 41 points &amp; 17 rebounds to lead the Magic (2-2).

Knicks 101, Magic 99.

Give him good pt and everything still, it’s just that Markell makes the people he’s playing with better. The starters have been fine but the bench has been awful.

- Williams out hurts the Magic production.  No one on roster can match his points.

But as Ross, Harris &amp; Okeke revert to their norm to improve bench; it's more than likely that the starters will regress.

For ex: 4 of 5 starters are hovering around or ≥40% from 3PT range...maybe it's real, but more than likely it's not.@CuseKnicksFan @statmuse @OrlandoMagic @Magic_PR @The_ColeAnthony @jalensuggs @wendellcarter34 @franzboogie Our bench has been bad@statmuse @OrlandoMagic @Magic_PR @The_ColeAnthony @jalensuggs @wendellcarter34 @franzboogie Then why are they 3-8?@Smartinez_00 @OrlandoMagic @statmuse @The_ColeAnthony @jalensuggs @franzboogie @wendellcarter34 @Magic_PR they're only 3-8, definitely not a bandwagoner if you hop on now 🚂🚂 https://t.co/8wQ5kvDjap@___joetaylor @srepy @OrlandoMagic @statmuse @The_ColeAnthony @jalensuggs @franzboogie @wendellcarter34 @Magic_PR No. That will destroy them, they just need to stay together and time.When bae says “Orlando Magics” and you have to block them afterwards

In 11 games, that starting 5 has only played 9 minutes in 4Q's.

Numbers support this as well, as Orlando is bottom 10 in rebounds given up AND assists given up.

Wendell — 14 PPG, 11 RPG, 51/40%

The ORLANDO MAGIC have the highest net rating (+18.1) when... Bamba, WCJ, Cole, Wagner and Suggs share the floor. 

Magic rebuild is off to a good start.The only team we’ve beaten so far is the Orlando Magic and that’s only because Franz Wagner is their best player. We ain’t beating the Rockets.🏀 @OrlandoMagic vs @BrooklynNets Preview 🏀

Yall are the Orlando Magic without himThis dude…..@OrlandoMagic @The_ColeAnthony https://t.co/BG1g198H7I@ilikethisteam11 @lastonetoarrive @DavidBaumannORL @OrlandoMagic It's not an issue anyway since when you look at the rotations, that particular lineup never plays garbage time minutes. Almost all their minutes are to start the 1st and 3rd. The only time they played the end of the game was when it was close and we won.Big rocket launch tonight down at Cape Canaveral. 9:03pm is the magic moment, weather conditions look decent with current launch chances at 80%.

That lineup doesn't play together in garbage time. Almost all of the minutes it has played are to start the 1st and 3rd quarters. So against starters.@Lghtngfan @OrlandoMagic @The_ColeAnthony @RjHampton14 I thought it was the first one.  It looks like he didn’t have any forward momentum and is just kinda hovering lolNahhhhh can those Orlando Magic Nelk boys jerseys be bought??????Orlando Magics 🧿 https://t.co/Eq8x261CbqCheck out 1990/91 NBA Hoops Sam Vincent RC SGC 9  w/ Michael Jordan #OrlandoMagic https://t.co/KrGiVfHhrp via @eBayAnalyzing Wednesday’s Brooklyn Nets at Orlando Magic odds and lines, with NBA expert picks, predictions and best bets.  https://t.co/CTfYAWw4KvWith the way the Pistons are going rn, it’s looking like we’re on the path way to our version of the Magic moment. 2 back to back number 1 picks like the Orlando Magic in the Shaq and Penny years and if we do that, let’s grab Paolo lolToday's NBA Picks: 7:10 PM ET - Brooklyn Nets vs. Orlando Magic - 1 PICK AVAILABLE: https://t.co/znHEyGlgIG #nba@HeartHustleORL Facts dude. That 09 team was the reason i became a magic fan. Glad he got his ring and im really hoping for him to retire in an Orlando magic uniform@LukeJalil @DavidBaumannORL @OrlandoMagic That’s also a reasonable contributor of the net rating of the starting 5. They’re still solid, but it’s boosted by garbage time minutes against opposition benches when other starting 5s would be sittingOrlando Magic according to casuals:

Cole Anthony - Funny interview guy
Mo Bamba - I got hooooooes haha love that song

&amp; I respect the Curry pick! Probably the most exciting player to ever grace a court@Thr33TTD NBA team? Orlando Magic and Golden State Warriors. Favorite player? Steph Curry@DavidBaumannORL @OrlandoMagic The team has always had an issue with third quarter scoring, it’s weird😞 we have had huge leads going into halftime, and then lose momentum in the thirdOrlando Magic https://t.co/CTBBJJp7T1Keeping his skills sharp when he is Orlando magic https://t.co/LRU1SsTfDPI don’t need to see anymore. Just get Emoni Bates in the weight room so he‘s ready to be an Orlando Magic@Hawksrevengeszn Gonna be 4-10 with a HUGE game against the Orlando Magic next Monday in Atlanta.If we win the next 2 games that would mean all our wins would've come against teams w/ winning records w/o 2 of our best players

Let me calm down though cause I feel the hypeness rising

@LauraSandrell @julieatidwell @RyanBJackson1 @EricLHughes @MPEStigers https://t.co/Wq0bNeIszB@DavidBaumannORL @OrlandoMagic Young athletic team. They don't get tired and don't take plays off because they want/need the experience. Pain in the ass to defend against a team like that in the 4th, especially if you're already up a ton.NEW: Franz Wagner follows in older brother’s footsteps, from learning basketball to the @OrlandoMagic.
