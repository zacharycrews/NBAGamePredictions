Lakers have only 14 chips in L.A. They won 3 in Mineapolis. So tehcnically and practically, the Lakers are only being owned by the Boston Celtics, who didn't move from city to city like cowards.Crazy gambling nugget, per @peterdewey2:

The Atlanta Hawks are 0-31 against the spread in losses this season.

Hawks are 7-point dogs tonight against the Boston Celtics at @FOXBet. https://t.co/RzZ1R6hYo1Can't wait to watch the Atlanta Hawks and Boston Celtics go at it tonight! Trae Young will have 30 points easy. #IUSportsCommBoston Celtics Starters:

Boston Celtics - Atlanta Hawks

Jayson Tatum O26.5 Points @ 1.85 ($100)

Primetime game at the TD Garden, facing an average defense like the Atlanta Hawks. Tatum will have the volume of shots to go over, so trusting him to hit them.

INDIANA PACERS, Final.The Boston Celtics have signed forward Matt Ryan to a two-way contract, the team announced today.  https://t.co/MFTFHDsmUISPURS at GRIZZLIES | FULL GAME HIGHLIGHTS | February 28, 2022 #Boston #Celtics #NBA Video: https://t.co/tOB63EIBVYHawks (29-31) at Celtics (36-27) Game #64 3/1/22 https://t.co/MRTqX5WFNS #celticsstrong #nba #bostonceltics@clare_shet00 Another double-digit rebound night. None were bigger than those in the final 2:30 of the game. Rebounding is position, desire and intelligence. Boston Celtics legend Bill Russell once said, “I got most of my rebounds before the shot ever hit the rim.” That’s you!https://t.co/bDzJ2Nnobt

Matt Ryan now with the 
Boston Celtics! https://t.co/c3pHSTwZmk@ColinCowherd  why did you talk about the Lakers so much when they are not even in The playoffs, they’re in the play in game , but there are lots of teams in the NBA including the Boston Celtics who have been the hottest team in the NBA and you never talk about them, You suck@wbz I believe it was Sudden Cardiac Arrest (Death). It is common amongst athletes, unfortunately. Reggie Lewis, that played for the Boston Celtics died at 27 from SCA/SCD. It is a tragedy that a child would die so unexpectedly. I pray for peace to those he left behind.Boston  Celtics will never win a championship unless they SIGN ISAIAH THOMAS.  IS CURSE . Celtics used him and he got hurt. The evil that men do leaves after them. They will never reach 2nd round in playoffs.  Sign Issiah THOMAS.@yifullofsin Like all those people who became Boston celtics fans in October and think anus freedumb is a hall of famer? 🏀2012 LEBRON JAMES - MIAMI HEAT @ BOSTON CELTICS FULL unused NBA TICKET SHEET #Lebron #LebronJames #MiamiHeat #NBA #NbaTwitter #TheHobby #SportsCards https://t.co/ISoJSwUAGhThank you Ronni luv my custom made hoodie. #celticsnation #BostonCeltics #BostonCelticsFan
