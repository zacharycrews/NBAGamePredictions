But you can’t ignore that one of the reasons he is frustrated is because he is having his worst statistical season since 2011/2012If James Harden is here after deadline, I have full confidence in the Nets to retain him. Nets will park a huge billboard in front of his Brooklyn apartment building.The narrative is that if @BrooklynNets lose it’s on @KyrieIrving because of his vaccination status 🤔 And how it going to cause a strain on @KDTrey5 &amp; @KyrieIrving relationship.

https://t.co/T81RZtH7OJThis should be obvious, but it seems like it's getting completely overlooked: The Nets could trade James Harden to a team that isn't Philly.

Now Harden is leaving (rumored, but I think true). Pisses me off.  @BrooklynNets@OG_Vxn @Tyren4President @CPenIV @emanuelgodina @LeBronFactory Oh ok now explain The Brooklyn Nets 🤔 which major star was there first. 

I get this is hard for you guys but show me when any player came out and said to the media “playing w/ Kyrie is a toxic atmosphere &amp; players don’t want to go there.”@JackTatar @BrooklynNets @samhinkie would have gotten the deal done. 😉@RuFan130 @BrooklynNets I really think it’s looking like we have Kyrie/Maxey/Curry/KD/Simmons Feb 26th at MilwaukeeIf the @BrooklynNets make this trade🤦🏾‍♂️ but if they do? They need to get @sdotcurry and a 1st rounder. Nobody in their right mind thinking @JHarden13 is leaving $70 mill on the table🤷🏾‍♂️ Either traded Thursday or sign with Nets off season.

Just don't leave the Nets. Have faith. That's all I'll say 🥲Nets won’t have KD, Kyrie or Harden against the Celtics tonight. A Boston win would drop Brooklyn to the 8th seed.

I feel like anyone who takes on Westbrook or Simmons is taking a risk, but Harden is not nearly the same level of risk, I guess that's what I'm thinking.@tomhandy1 Harden and a second rounder for Simmons and Seth Curry. @sixers @BrooklynNets@BrooklynNets Either I don't understand English or somebody's lying😒 https://t.co/0HHhuUpYdDresting harden so he can pass his physical thanks @BrooklynNetsI kind of want to watch the Celtics-Nets game tonight more than I want to watch the Sixers.  No Harden, no Kyrie, no Durant, in Brooklyn, all Boston fans in the stands, 9th straight loss.  It’s gonna be glorious.@BrooklynNetcast I hope it's a win, because it's hard to see this bad moment of the Brooklyn nets@NBA @celtics @BrooklynNets @Bucks @Lakers CelticsLast 3 games Brooklyn Nets given up 4th most rebounds per game also 4th worse field goal percentage

I definitely think Harden will be a Sixer only way I see that not happening is if the Nets make a run this year and he decides that he wants to stay committed and win in BrooklynI wish @Dame_Lillard would go to the @BrooklynNets .

#BleedGreen https://t.co/ypPUyE5BHQ@BrooklynNets @TISSOT Nets are wasting kds last few years@SportsRadioWIP Yes but takes away leverage for Brooklyn to be assured harden can’t leave them for nothing. Now harden could sign with the blazers and the nets get nothing in return. That’s very helpful in pursuing the harden deal by Thursday.@OmarAbedWrites @Lakers @BrooklynNets I think more so because Harden &amp; much of the surrounding pieces puts Philadelphia in win-now mode versus Westbrook coming over forces you to retool the offense. 

It’s also primarily because Russ-Embiid just wouldn’t be a good fit, so it would be more to move Ben out.Get tickets now and go see Brooklyn Nets vs. Boston Celtics at Barclays Center in Brooklyn tonight at 7:30PM.

I agree with you. I’m saying I’m not in favor of giving famous athletes an exception.

I am in favor of the mandate, but am open to arguments that there are now diminishing or even negative returns.

It's obviously Tatum@BrooklynNets @HSpecialSurgery This is insane.

I think there’s still merit to this argument.Also, #NetsWorld It's Game Day

U get the younger, (about 8yrs), less expensive &amp; already signed player. Sixers get someone who can help Joel the next 2/3yrs at an unbelievably high salary. If Irving would play every day, Ben's is better in your starting 5.@fabianperspectv @Dagaustin2000 @PodThorn @kkdreamss @remixfaz3 @BrooklynNets @SteveNash No, Nash not the biggest problem by a mile. Kyrie and his mental stability is.

Thought Jrue for Din and picks was the move but Bucks beat us to it. Feel Marks got boxed in by the cap and limited targets in free agency this summer, which led to some roster issues.@BrooklynNets Brooklyn Universe

#BleedGreen@PodThorn @Dagaustin2000 @kkdreamss @remixfaz3 @BrooklynNets @SteveNash Right, but I was making these critiques of Nash last season too. I’m not discounting any of this. I’m saying it’s made an imperfect at best hire into a huge liability.

But I think you kind of mic dropped with that last line there 🤣@Tabak10 @PodThorn @kkdreamss @remixfaz3 @BrooklynNets @SteveNash We complain abt rotations but how can there b set rotation &amp;roles when guys r constantly in &amp;out of the lineup,it’s been really tough in that regard so far but he beautifully managed it last season when Kai was playing &amp; they had more shooting.JH needs 2 stop bitchin if he’s hereConsensus Line Move:

So I’m not buying that. Team plays listless unless Bembrybor rookies are on court.@Dagaustin2000 @kkdreamss @PodThorn @remixfaz3 @BrooklynNets @SteveNash Yeah for sure. We were talking about it in Spaces last night. One reason before the Sap signing I was skeptical about re-signing both Bruce and Blake and adding Bembry and JJ. 

Just a lot of incomplete players fighting for the limited spots.@Tabak10 @PodThorn @kkdreamss @remixfaz3 @BrooklynNets @SteveNash It’s a seriously flawed roster when Kai isn’t out there playing,his bball brilliance masks other team deficiencies when he’s out there w/ Harden &amp; KD. Is Nash the best X &amp; O’s guy, hell no but that’s really not what is needed here,u need a guy who garners respect &amp; can mange egos@kkdreamss @Dagaustin2000 @PodThorn @remixfaz3 @BrooklynNets @SteveNash No worries bro.

They would have been a lot more accepted by the city if it was the NEW YORK Nets. 

Oh well, fuck that team. #knicksup@PodThorn @kkdreamss @Dagaustin2000 @remixfaz3 @BrooklynNets @SteveNash Dishonest? It’s a lot easier with a character limit to cite a win loss record than discuss nuance. You can debate me without having to try to undermine my integrity to win your argument.

You’re better than that.@BrooklynNets @SteveNash Yall hating on nash when it should be on sean marks and the harden trade disaster.  Who trades allen, levert and prince and then couldnt sign dinwiddie for harden? https://t.co/hvkSUJygFW@Dagaustin2000 @PodThorn @kkdreamss @remixfaz3 @BrooklynNets @SteveNash The coach himself has said repeatedly he’s struggling 2 get the roster 2 implement the staff’s schemes. How many times can he say we just need to run more actions? Lol

If you are not able to judge the roster and coaching both in relation to one another and indepentedly we can 🛑@Tabak10 @Dagaustin2000 @PodThorn @remixfaz3 @BrooklynNets @SteveNash My bad if it came off rude i was just giving my opinion 🤷🏽‍♂️New tumblr post: "### NBA2K22 Toronto Raptors vs Brooklyn Nets MyLeague PS4 GAMES..." https://t.co/0pml9tO3iM ifttt, youtube@kkdreamss @Dagaustin2000 @PodThorn @remixfaz3 @BrooklynNets @SteveNash It wasn’t a comment about their roster.

Thats all i have to say.@BrooklynNets y’all better get drummond, curry and Simmons for harden bc y’all still gone be weak in the paint@Dagaustin2000 @PodThorn @kkdreamss @remixfaz3 @BrooklynNets @SteveNash They had a lot. Maybe not to the extent Nets have.

None of that excuses the teams consistently starting games with no energy. None of that explains the lack of offensive identity (the clashing with Harden partially does).

He’s still learning, but I don’t like his instincts.Looks like Harden stays in Brooklyn.....

They have way more depth@Dagaustin2000 @PodThorn @kkdreamss @remixfaz3 @BrooklynNets @SteveNash Sure, I apoplectic when they let Spence go for nothing even though I knew Tsai would.

Relying on role players how super teams work. We know Marks over compensated for size and rebounding in the summer. We know the injuries. That doesn’t negate that there may be issues elsewhere.@Tabak10 @PodThorn @kkdreamss @remixfaz3 @BrooklynNets @SteveNash Miami’s hasn’t had the kind of injuries/bad luck that Brooklyn has. Harden had to play his way into shape b/c he was rehabbing &amp; couldn’t get his usual summer workouts in on the court, KD got hurt, and Kyrie has played only around 10 games all season plus they haven’t had Harris@DerekBodnerNBA Right shoulder sprain = Newest Brooklyn Net?@Tabak10 @PodThorn @kkdreamss @remixfaz3 @BrooklynNets @SteveNash This roster was built w/ having the Big 3 around most of the time, which might have been a big flaw in of itself. The biggest reason I wanted Spencer brought back aside from being a great Net was injury insurance 4 JH &amp; Kai after what happened in the playoffs &amp; when he goes awol@Dagaustin2000 @PodThorn @kkdreamss @remixfaz3 @BrooklynNets @SteveNash Sure, everybody understands this but  Nets aren’t the only team in the league where this is true. Have consistently had at least time star on the court. 

Look at Miami, they have a great coach keeps the culture intact through injuries. If the roster so bad why not play Millsap?@Tabak10 @PodThorn @kkdreamss @remixfaz3 @BrooklynNets @SteveNash *over-rely@Tabak10 @PodThorn @kkdreamss @remixfaz3 @BrooklynNets @SteveNash Even having to over-relying on rookie  contributions b/c guys like Harris have been out &amp; a guy like Patty who was supposed to be our 6th man has had to take on a massive offensive load in his absence, creating a huge hole off the bench. So many issues rn can’t put it all on Nash@PodThorn @kkdreamss @remixfaz3 @BrooklynNets @SteveNash It’s clear that the in and out status of Kyrie and Harden is wreaking havoc on the Nets style and approach. But you can’t make that observation and then give Nash no blame.@Tabak10 @PodThorn @kkdreamss @remixfaz3 @BrooklynNets @SteveNash Problem is they have suffered so many injuries &amp; w/ guys in &amp; out of the lineup 4 diff reasons they have had 2 rely on bottom of the roster guys like JC &amp; James Johnson far too much this season.2 high end role players frm last season (BG &amp; BB) taking a nosedive also hasn’t helped@PodThorn @kkdreamss @remixfaz3 @BrooklynNets @SteveNash That’s not emperical evidence buddy. Those are decontextualized stats. 

The roster is fucked right now. Sam was on this last night and it’s right. But Nash’s poor performance has compounded the issue.Despite currently being the 7 seed in the Eastern Conference… 

The Brooklyn Nets have the best conference winning percentage in the East 

They are also the ONLY team in the East to not lose double digit games within the conference 

(20-9 against Eastern Conference opponents)@PodThorn @kkdreamss @remixfaz3 @BrooklynNets @SteveNash Mans has an elite staff (mostly Marks  guys) and struggles to implement the game plan. He talks about that fact frequently in his comments to the media. Team is still searching for an identity.

I’m not discounting the roster flux but these aspects can be assessed individually.@PodThorn @BrooklynNets @SteveNash Lol then why on earth are you saying something so outrageous?@PodThorn @kkdreamss @remixfaz3 @BrooklynNets @SteveNash Yves, love you man. But never tell me who I’ve been influenced by when you don’t know me.

Empirical evidence? Citing the roster health? Not how it works. I’ve been on Nash’s lack of command/ability to command the roster like his oredesceasor since Dec 20.Who is most likely to still be a Brooklyn Net come Friday? https://t.co/ipyAjRncOV"He plays for the Brooklyn Nets, and there's nothing I can do about that.

#TradingCards #ForSale #eBay https://t.co/zU1xe4cB1VNets need someone like Thanasis or Bazemore, a guy that can hype up the team with 800 claps a game. 

Sign me up I'll even tweet at the same time too @BrooklynNetsSo is Steve Nash a failure at HC of the @BrooklynNets ? Gifted two former league MVPs and Kyrie Irvin and he has zero control of the team. Was Nash given a job too soon?Love seeing Blake Griffin perform well

The best version of the Brooklyn Nets includes him

IF James Harden remains on the Brooklyn Nets through the Trade Deadline; I’ll be rooting for the Cleveland Cavaliers with former Nets (Jarrett Allen and Caris LeVert) if they match up against the Nets in the Playoffs@BrooklynNets We should change your name to the “Brooklyn Divas” since that seems to be all you have on your team…a bunch of over priced cry baby’sEveryone has been following the #Nets drama with James Harden, but what other names could GM Sean Marks be looking at before the #NBATradeDeadline? @RealCodyMallory examines some who could be a fit for Brooklyn

Obviously the top players all make each other better, and he's in that category" - Joel Embiid on Philly radio.@RepublicansWhy @DarthAnonymous2 @ranglebangle @RamfamPodcaster @bgrisakDTR @DangeRussWilson I am talking about long term. The Rams are the Brooklyn Nets of the NFL. If those generational players go to IR, how good is that team in a tough NFC West ?@BrooklynNets @SteveNash Hell nah, he’s the worst coachShaquille O'Neal Slams Kyrie Irving, Tells Him To Leave The Brooklyn Nets: “We Have A Chance To Win And If You Ain't On The Program, Go Somewhere Else, Period." https://t.co/E68r848qLbCheck out this listing I just added to my #Poshmark closet: New Vintage Brooklyn Nets button up STARTER jacket. https://t.co/Dzw2AdzOE4 #shopmycloset @poshmarkappThe beard 🤔 #nba #allstar #basketball #jamesharden #brooklynnets #76ers https://t.co/gbnnEVlTvF@BrooklynNets @SteveNash Worse coach in the NBA 🎊🎊🎊🎊🎊🎊@BrooklynNets @SteveNash I don’t wantThere are two teams you don’t want Ben Simmons going to. That’s the Warriors and the Nets. If Morey trades Simmons to Brooklyn, he’s an idiot. The Sixers would never get by a trio of KD-Kyrie-Simmons.@BrooklynNets @SteveNash It looks disgusting. Nash doesn't have the ability to coach at all. at best, he is a good consultant or shooting coach, and the management of the company is more like a joke, destroying Durant and destroying the team together with Nash.Brooklyn is interested in Jerami Grant, as noted earlier. That’s the type of aggressive move that could maybe sway James Harden to stay.

At this point, Tsai &amp; the Nets should leave no stone unturned. Go big, use the TPEs, invest whatever to try &amp; convince Harden to stay.i hope that my best friend's grandpappy's brooklyn nets start doing better soon76ers Center Joel Embiid Was Asked about playing with Brooklyn Nets James Harden #Netsworld https://t.co/J1nIjOEh1HBrooklyn Nets @ Denver Nuggets Film Thread (02/07/2022)

But with that logic why were nets even considered a contender with a rookie coach? Literally never coached a professional game at any level. Starting 2 rookies wouldn't be that bad if we had KD Kyrie and Harden at 100% both in health and talent. But I digressNets have 'poked around' at trading for Pistons' Jerami Grant: Repo...

 #Brooklyn_Nets@kahronspearman Media loves to pile on Harden for whatever reason. When he was with @HoustonRockets it was he was too iso, now dishing like a madman when needed for @BrooklynNets it’s his scoring is down!My source, @stykes10 reporting the Philadelphia #76ers are acquiring star guard James Harden in a trade with the Brooklyn #Nets in a package centered around Ben Simmons. 

Deal expected to be officially announced in the coming hours.@BrooklynNets Its to bad Kyrie, Harden and Durant take turns playing basketball..  Starting to wonder if they even like playing with each other?How the fuck are Brooklyn nets favorites with this shitty team and a Kyrie that can't play home games
You know why?

Because the Brooklyn Nets are coming@PodThorn @OGNETS1 @BrooklynNets @SteveNash Rookies are not an issue if they have a decent coach. Toronto has a great rookie that is a starter. Last year Melo Ball made Hornets a team to look at. Mobley is playing well for the Cavs. And those teams have lesser players around then than Harden, KD and Kyrie. It's the coach@TickPick Hi as you know the game between the Washington Wizard and the Brooklyn Nets has been postponed because of the plague.  I got new tickets but on this date I have plane tickets out of town.
