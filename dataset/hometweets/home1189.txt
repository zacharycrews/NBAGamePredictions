The Mavs are -8.5 in Detroit tonight, and everyone is backing the pistons. Not me! I’m over it. This number is too high and begging the public to take the points.

Give me Dallas -8.5Dallas Mavericks at Detroit Pistons odds, picks and predictions https://t.co/Lrxk5eXG7NSo if Boston loses Thursday and the Bucks rest-lose Friday at Detroit, and Sixers go 2-0, Sixers will have to decide on the Pistons game. Win and they would be the 2-seed and *potentially* face Nets. Lose and they’d be 4 (and could face Nets in Round 2). https://t.co/L1t2kamRJYShout out to the @DetroitPistons for letting us get some practice in before tomorrow's Tip Off Tournament. #ForThe313

Scottie has an offensive rating that ranks in the top tier (Jazz or Suns)

Mobley has a below average offensive rating, similar to a team like the Pistons or Rockets.

But Cade has an offensive rating that is 10 points below the NBA worst Orlando Magic. https://t.co/J3tgHIoHv0Detroit Pistons trainer leads, makes NBA history - Women Leading in male dominated industries  https://t.co/j5FmL9o1ud@JDsSportsTweets @woodwardsports @AdhamBeydoun Two issues though:

He had a good season with more “talent” than pistons and they’re stuck at home for the playoffs like us. So what would be different in Detroit?

Pelicans are in playoff hunt w/o Zion yet your argument is we need Zion to get out of gutter..lol

Furthermore your bright idea is to trade away #Pistons franchise piece that loves Detroit for a player who refuses to play.

Your entire logic is pretty naiveThe Detroit Pistons!!@NBATV @DetroitPistons @CadeCunningham_ @IsiahThomas Cade! thanks for balling for my fantasy team this season!As I’m up grading, one of my students wrote his argument on why football is a better sport than basketball.. One of his points.. The Bad Boys of the @DetroitPistons were one of his talking points. Even after all these years, people talk about the “malice at the Palace.” WithYOUR CITY. YOUR HOUSE. Rep the Tigers and your other favorite local teams! https://t.co/ggjo6HgUyG

I'm SURE Isiah Thomas believes the Pistons would have won the title in 1988 if he hadn't gotten hurt.

https://t.co/B4BQBEgKiVCan’t wait for @LCArena_Detroit to sound like this again next year. 

@DetroitPistons @CadeCunningham_ @SaddiqBey https://t.co/yRodAeDbFT@Super70sSports Boy the Detroit Pistons were just such dirty players... https://t.co/8LX7g0xeuJ@the_mayo_muslim @DetroitPistons @celtics Lol plz make it stopJokic having a good game but losing to the spurs and I guarantee nobody will say a fucking word about it like they did w embiid and the pistons. This will affect his mvp case null, as it shouldn’t, yet sixers loss to detroit “killed” embiidsI promised my nephew that I would take him to the next @DetroitPistons home playoff game, thinking I’d have another 3-4 years before I had to buy the tickets.

With the way @CadeCunningham_ is playing lately, I feel like I better start saving for next season. See you in 2023 LCA!@jhsthethird @FletcherWDSU There is no way you just called SADDIQ BEY a franchise cornerstone.. Every Detroit sports team has been poverty for years, at this point y'all should take whatever u can get to get out the gutter😭 Zion is better than anyone who has worn a Pistons uniform in the past 10 years 🤣@brraaanndon The Sacramento Kings and Detroit Pistons have managed wins against top teamsIt would REALLY not be a bad thing if Detroit lost its last three games. #Pistons https://t.co/TcNC1xPxMjWell @KingJames your #AprilFoolsDay2022 wasn't a Joke after All!!
This is 2nd time you Openly Condemned yourself, 1st time was eastern finales against @DetroitPistons an U said b4 game 6 You wasn't posed to be here an u Loss right after that SmHNBA Basketball Game Betting Picks Simulator: 4/6/2022 7:00 PM ET - Dallas Mavericks vs. Detroit Pistons - YOU CAN RUN THE GAME SIMULATION FOR FREE HERE: https://t.co/WrmAlM3d5x #nba #sportsbetting #freepicks #cappertekDon’t forget these guys #Pistons @DetroitPistons they had some battles. https://t.co/ov7NiKZyCX https://t.co/4x1e2vzW4R@benmaller Don't believe me? Just ask the 2004-05 @DetroitPistons!Detroit News seeking a reporter to cover Detroit Pistons https://t.co/MXfaXSMSmmNever forget the time Lebron James posted 48 pts as a 22 yr old in a GM 5 against the 2006-2007 Pistons in Detroit. The star was born.@iPacersblog On one hand, yes

On the other, I have Philly u50.5 wins on the season with Toronto, Detroit, and us again

Go Raptors and Pistons I guessHell yeah WE HAD THEM JOINTS FOR AT LEAST 3 SEASONS NOW @DetroitPistons NO MORE GREY https://t.co/4eC6rPMYAr https://t.co/qIxwuyJqnL@donaldvmitch @DET2335 @cal_detroit Both of y'all are right. But can someone explain why it's the Pistons that are linked to him? Just the random local journalist who asked for Bey?@Pistons__Talk @YahooSports I’d be happy with any of the top 5 players being a Detroit Piston next season. I think this rebuild is going to happen a lot faster than everyone thought. Another impactful rookie and a good free agent signing could put this team in the playoffs next season.OKC wins.

@DetroitPistons, don’t you dare win another game this season..@okcthunder good dub, @DetroitPistons appreciate you 🫵🏽🙏🏽@DET2335 @cal_detroit Clearly Zion not a leader, too bad the Pistons don’t got 1 of those guys that they just took with the number 1 pick. He’s not the first player to be injury riddled to start his career. The reward is worth the risk when the reward is potentially having two top 15 players.@DetroitPistons @Dreamville_33 @CadeCunningham_ @MB3FIVE @JeramiGrant @FWJackson15 Keep winning pointless games and get a lower draft pick. 👍@thadon1971 @tigers @DetroitPistons I know!!@HiveCards @UniqueFinds09 Looking for Detroit (Lions, Tigers, Red Wings, Pistons), Michigan State (in pro or college colors all sports) and Carolina Hurricanes@RyanFieldABC The Detroit D is awesome. Cursive Detroit? That is so lame and boring.  It’s like the pistons   There’s nothing cool about their jersey at all https://t.co/ntdB11EYUA@ChrisFedor @cavs 3-7 last 10. 3 wins vs. shitty @DetroitPistons @OrlandoMagic @nyknicks 
5 losses to playoff teams, 2 losses to shitty @Lakers @OrlandoMagic

I’m picking him up from school at lunch time so we can leave early. He’s trying to miss the whole school day lol.@MoneyBagsMel20 @tigers @DetroitPistons Oh yeah!! Hope y'all have a great time ⚾🏀@thadon1971 I didn’t realize @tigers opening day was Friday. Me and Adrian are headed to Detroit to see @DetroitPistons play. Detroit’s going to be busy!@cal_detroit I don’t think so either, but I definitely don’t think the Pistons should be the ones saying no@BallySportsDET @DetroitPistons @DetroitRedWings @tigers You need to be on Youtube TV asap@FletcherWDSU If the pistons traded bey or killian for him I would be so ticked. Bey especially. He’s a Detroit guy now, and he needs to be a guy they build a team around. Him and Cade are the cornerstones.It’s such a fun time for Detroit sports fans. Tigers brought up Tork and Greene, Pistons have Cade, Bey, Livers, and Bagley to helm the new age, and the Lions gave 4 1st rounders the next 2 years to build their team into something great. I’m excited. #DetroitVsEveryonehttps://t.co/KLhjYARSG0 

The Detroit Pistons stunned the league last Thursday nighthttps://t.co/pnzJKOuXdQ 
The Detroit Pistons gave the Brooklyn Nets a run for their moneyStill my favorite NBA trivia:
On Jan. 4, 1963 future NBA Hall of Fame forward Bailey Howell of the Detroit Pistons shoots 0-14 from the floor vs the St. Louis Hawks.
Jan. 3, 1965, Howell, now with the Baltimore Bullets, shoots 14-14 vs. SF Warriors.@DavidVujanic Some may call staying up to watch the Detroit Pistons crazy but we, us.. my friend, call us innovators@daniellabruce_ I'm happy for you Daniella, and keep up the great work you are doing with the @DetroitRedWings and I have faith in Steve to turn the franchise around and same with Troy Weaver with the @DetroitPistons https://t.co/3tBH4VtFpFcrying you bozos thought you could out tank us??? @trailblazers @DetroitPistons https://t.co/yweQBqYoGv@DetroitPistons Can I get a print of it?Congratulations to chubby_starfish4549 who moved up 1 spot to take #9 on the Detroit Pistons team leaderboard.

The Pistons definitely seem to act like their rebuild’s over - which should scare their fans if this is what it looks like moving forward.That Center in Cleveland, Moses Brown, he's looking very interesting.  @DetroitPistons he's a free agent too.
