Mobley has a below average offensive rating, similar to a team like the Pistons or Rockets.

Pelicans are in playoff hunt w/o Zion yet your argument is we need Zion to get out of gutter..lol

Furthermore your bright idea is to trade away #Pistons franchise piece that loves Detroit for a player who refuses to play.

Your entire logic is pretty naiveThe Detroit Pistons!!@NBATV @DetroitPistons @CadeCunningham_ @IsiahThomas Cade! thanks for balling for my fantasy team this season!As I‚Äôm up grading, one of my students wrote his argument on why football is a better sport than basketball..

This will affect his mvp case null, as it shouldn‚Äôt, yet sixers loss to detroit ‚Äúkilled‚Äù embiidsI promised my nephew that I would take him to the next @DetroitPistons home playoff game, thinking I‚Äôd have another 3-4 years before I had to buy the tickets.

With the way @CadeCunningham_ is playing lately, I feel like I better start saving for next season. See you in 2023 LCA!@jhsthethird @FletcherWDSU There is no way you just called SADDIQ BEY a franchise cornerstone.. Every Detroit sports team has been poverty for years, at this point y'all should take whatever u can get to get out the gutterüò≠ Zion is better than anyone who has worn a Pistons uniform in the past 10 years ü§£@brraaanndon The Sacramento Kings and Detroit Pistons have managed wins against top teamsIt would REALLY not be a bad thing if Detroit lost its last three games. #Pistons https://t.co/TcNC1xPxMjWell @KingJames your #AprilFoolsDay2022 wasn't a Joke after All!!

Just ask the 2004-05 @DetroitPistons!Detroit News seeking a reporter to cover Detroit Pistons https://t.co/MXfaXSMSmmNever forget the time Lebron James posted 48 pts as a 22 yr old in a GM 5 against the 2006-2007 Pistons in Detroit. The star was born.@iPacersblog On one hand, yes

On the other, I have Philly u50.5 wins on the season with Toronto, Detroit, and us again

Go Raptors and Pistons I guessHell yeah WE HAD THEM JOINTS FOR AT LEAST 3 SEASONS NOW @DetroitPistons NO MORE GREY https://t.co/4eC6rPMYAr https://t.co/qIxwuyJqnL@donaldvmitch @DET2335 @cal_detroit Both of y'all are right. But can someone explain why it's the Pistons that are linked to him? Just the random local journalist who asked for Bey?@Pistons__Talk @YahooSports I‚Äôd be happy with any of the top 5 players being a Detroit Piston next season. I think this rebuild is going to happen a lot faster than everyone thought. Another impactful rookie and a good free agent signing could put this team in the playoffs next season.OKC wins.

@DetroitPistons, don‚Äôt you dare win another game this season..@okcthunder good dub, @DetroitPistons appreciate you ü´µüèΩüôèüèΩ@DET2335 @cal_detroit Clearly Zion not a leader, too bad the Pistons don‚Äôt got 1 of those guys that they just took with the number 1 pick. He‚Äôs not the first player to be injury riddled to start his career. The reward is worth the risk when the reward is potentially having two top 15 players.@DetroitPistons @Dreamville_33 @CadeCunningham_ @MB3FIVE @JeramiGrant @FWJackson15 Keep winning pointless games and get a lower draft pick. üëç@thadon1971 @tigers @DetroitPistons I know!!@HiveCards @UniqueFinds09 Looking for Detroit (Lions, Tigers, Red Wings, Pistons), Michigan State (in pro or college colors all sports) and Carolina Hurricanes@RyanFieldABC The Detroit D is awesome.

Bey especially. He‚Äôs a Detroit guy now, and he needs to be a guy they build a team around. Him and Cade are the cornerstones.It‚Äôs such a fun time for Detroit sports fans. Tigers brought up Tork and Greene, Pistons have Cade, Bey, Livers, and Bagley to helm the new age, and the Lions gave 4 1st rounders the next 2 years to build their team into something great. I‚Äôm excited. #DetroitVsEveryonehttps://t.co/KLhjYARSG0
