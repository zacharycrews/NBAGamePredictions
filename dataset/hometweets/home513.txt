And that Sacramento clock is definitely broken. Seriously, how many times did the game grt stopped to adjust the time? @BrandonRahbar@statmuse @TyHaliburton22 @SacramentoKings Who is this?@statmuse @TyHaliburton22 @SacramentoKings Better than fox@statmuse @TyHaliburton22 @SacramentoKings the goat@SacramentoKings what a choke of a 4th quarter. So many bad fouls.@chriiiiishh @ben_fleckner @SacramentoKings Ive been reading that fox wants out of SacIt was against OKC, but my Haliburton agenda will not stop. HAND HIM THE KEYS @SacramentoKings https://t.co/BjYIyNSpbz@ben_fleckner @SacramentoKings haliburton's insane but hopefully fox returns to normalThe Kings are 3-0 in games I attend. JUSSSS SAAAAAYIN @SacramentoKings@SacramentoKings NBA Refs are the most rigged in all sports.Trio of this match should never whistle a single match again.They tried to help okc to make it tied.I’m watching basketball for over years now and most of the fouls they whistled were on joke level.These refs are not clean in my eyes@SacramentoKings get De’Aaron to notice please@krishcoughran 100% agree. The Sacramento kings drained fox’s mentality and love for Sacramento simply bc they did nothing to build around him. The sooner Vivek gets his opinion out of All our moves we try to make the sooner we can move in the right direction.Man this @SacramentoKings team had a 14 point lead with less than 2 minutes left and OKC STILL made it close …but with this team a W is W I suppose🤖 #SofiAlert

No. Absolutely not. But as the old saying goes: "A win is a win." This team needs every win it can get, and tonight is no different.

Another great performance for Tyrese Haliburton. Big night for Damian Jones. Bounce-back for Buddy.Winning always feels better.
