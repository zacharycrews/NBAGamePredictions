Jazz with Mitchell, Conley, Bojan lost to Pistons.

You still have to win the games and the Raptors have 6 in a row.

Also, BOS home fans are quiet. Moot levels to SB Arena piped sound.OVERNIGHT NBA PLAY

The Suns have comparable length across the board and the bigs to dominate the glass. Ayton should have a big game. Toronto’s 2nd unit should also get torn apart tomorrow.

Timeline today:

Yay, schools are opening! Can I go to a Raptors game too?@Tremblay_5227 @IvanArbour @MGOBlue_25 @OHLinsiders Are they that spoiled in London? Whatever happened to taking the Kawhi Leonard approach? Kawhi didn't want to come to Toronto when he was traded there - but he showed up, played his heart out like a professional should and took the Raptors to a championship.@TeacherMr_G @Eric__Smith @lakewilcoxps @Raptors One of the classiest people in media in this country. Someone who understands kindness is free and uses his platform to make an impact on people.@303Nick @scotiabank @Raptors @ScotiabankArena Rub it in?
