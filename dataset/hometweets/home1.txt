(1) Golden State Warriors (West) 
(2) Philadelphia 76ers (East)2 - Golden State Warriors (51.5 o/u)

Returning Wiseman, year two of Moody/Kaminga, &amp; a healthier Klay rounding back into form negates the loses of GP Jr, Porter, etc. Divencenzo is a lowkey good signing. What is their to say other than I just like one team a bit more?

OVER 51.5Got the @Bucks to play the @warriors or @LAClippers if they stay healthy and hungry for the NBA Finals with the @BrooklynNets as a wildcard in the East and the @memgrizz in the west as 2nd favorites.

"If you playboy the edge, you're gonna go over the edge... its not a matter of if, it's a matter of when you cross that line.." #NBAonTNT 
@warriors @NBAonTNT@princellasmith @NBAonTNT @Money23Green @warriors You just said exactly what everyone is thinking. Draymond should have been suspended, so we didn’t have to talk about him on ring night, to show kids there’s consequences to your actions. But instead, it’s just damage control for both parties. Pretty disappointing.@warriors @Bucks @BrooklynNets @MiamiHEAT @celtics @Lakers (lebron Ad healthy no westbrick)It would be so cool if Kehlani performed her Golden State Warriors Anthem “Champion” tonight to honor the MVP @StephenCurry30 !!

The Golden State Warriors will win the NBA Championship for the 2022-2023 season.🏀🎯 @warriors @NBA@warriors Ring #5 pending… 👀@NBAonTNT @Money23Green @warriors Just watched the entire things, &amp; it's basically an effort to rehabilitate Draymond Green's image. I'm not feeling it at all. Don't forget that not only is opening night also ring night for the Draymond's team, the Warriors, but he is on TNT's payroll as a commentator. #NBAonTNT@warriors ready to watch the goat 🫡@warriors i love you steph.@NBAonTNT just gave @warriors @Money23Green his own @30for30 on the Jordan Poole punch.

Davis is averageing 24.8 P and 12.1 R in 24 games against the Golden State Warriors . I belive that a healthy Davis would get a DD against a Golden State team at that size any day of the week

If they won 🏆: it’s because they spent huge 💰 💴 on the roster. Everyone can win with that much money spent on them. 

Otherwise: They wasted money on a garbage team

That is all.@DogSurfRoadshow @LockedOnDubs @warriors @Rick24Barry For the legend: You never made &lt;90% of your FTs in the NBA (technically 89.9%). Why do you think todays players who struggle so much at the line(i.e. Simmons &amp; others) don't adopt your FT shot? Pride? Embarrassment? Unaware of your dominance at the line &amp; your style of FT shot?🤷🏾‍♂️What communications platform do your 2022 NBA Champions use to talk winning strategies? Well it's the same organization who happens to also be favoured to win in 2023.

and I'm sure you guessed it ... Golden State use RingCentral! 

Go Warriors!!!
