There’s no such thing as being hot@JoeyTheMisfit @Lizard_King147 @Raptors @ScottBarnes561 Nah, if you really watched it in the fourth quarter the other teammates were being ball hoggers by barely passing the ball at all while they were bricking shots especially with OG and yeah Wizards did but they were also being selfish by not passing.@Raptors Firsttt@ogchabzo @HR_6IX @buc8889 @yaboyipso @Raptors @ScottBarnes561 I know, I’m just illustrating my point@PsAndQss @ogchabzo @yaboyipso @HR_6IX @Raptors @ScottBarnes561 Bruhhhh im saying for that one game yes he was. Overall? Fuck no its easily pascal fred and og. The exception is when a player has a hot hand, U LET THEM SHOOT no matter who it is. Dont let him take the last shot but he gotta keep it rolling@PsAndQss @buc8889 @ogchabzo @yaboyipso @Raptors @ScottBarnes561 U don’t understand how good games work.@ogchabzo @HR_6IX @buc8889 @yaboyipso @Raptors @ScottBarnes561 He made a few tough shots.

Couldn’t have predicted it. The ends don’t justify the means or disprove the means@Raptors He got fined for that dam@yaboyipso @JoeyTheMisfit @Lizard_King147 @Raptors @ScottBarnes561 First of all I'm a kid that you're saying and yeah they did but in the whole fourth quarter they were being ball hoggers and were bricking shots while barely even passed the ball. That's why Barnes could not do much.@PsAndQss @buc8889 @ogchabzo @yaboyipso @Raptors @ScottBarnes561 That is literally the dumbest thing I heard bc they fucking scored 18 points the lowest out of any quarter.@HR_6IX @buc8889 @ogchabzo @yaboyipso @Raptors @ScottBarnes561 Didn’t say that. I’m just saying they should play their 4th quarter the same way they always do. Not any different just bc Scottie was having a good game (unless it was a matchup thing where they just really couldn’t stop Scottie but I don’t think it was)@HR_6IX @PsAndQss @buc8889 @ogchabzo @Raptors @ScottBarnes561 no i dont, neither does Nick

neither would any decent NBA coach

you think im hating on scottie but im not@PsAndQss @buc8889 @ogchabzo @yaboyipso @Raptors @ScottBarnes561 Clearly u don’t have confidence in our rookie bc u don’t think he would play good in the 4th quarter.@HR_6IX @buc8889 @ogchabzo @yaboyipso @Raptors @ScottBarnes561 What?***@HR_6IX @buc8889 @ogchabzo @yaboyipso @Raptors @ScottBarnes561 No? What!@PsAndQss @buc8889 @ogchabzo @yaboyipso @Raptors @ScottBarnes561 Ok so just don’t play good offence bc you’re paranoid got it.@andredepape @Raptors This is excellent work@HR_6IX @buc8889 @ogchabzo @yaboyipso @Raptors @ScottBarnes561 Having a “hot hand” is a fallacy@PsAndQss @buc8889 @ogchabzo @yaboyipso @Raptors @ScottBarnes561 Literally everyone else shot like garbage but yeah bro don’t give it to the hot hand and almost blow a 18 point lead.@yaboyipso @HR_6IX @buc8889 @ogchabzo @Raptors @ScottBarnes561 Not what I mean. If he takes those same 19 shots again, he probably makes less than 12 of them@gosportsgo6 @YABarnes4ROTY @JLew1050 right barely play this season. If not injured, Covid. @Raptors should get a REAL C.

Doesn’t mean he’s gonna keep shooting at that rate@PsAndQss @buc8889 @ogchabzo @yaboyipso @Raptors @ScottBarnes561 Bc he shot 12/19 r u dumb?@HR_6IX @buc8889 @ogchabzo @yaboyipso @Raptors @ScottBarnes561 What kinda logic is that? Who’s to say we would have scored any more with him@PsAndQss @buc8889 @ogchabzo @yaboyipso @Raptors @ScottBarnes561 He clearly would’ve been since we scored 18 points without him@yaboyipso @buc8889 @ogchabzo @HR_6IX @Raptors @ScottBarnes561 You’re right, but relax lol@ogchabzo @yaboyipso @buc8889 @HR_6IX @Raptors @ScottBarnes561 That’s a fallacy@buc8889 @ogchabzo @yaboyipso @HR_6IX @Raptors @ScottBarnes561 He’s not the best scorer on the team… just bc he had been playing as their best scorer through 3 quarters doesn’t mean he still would be the best scorer in the last quarterI will not apologize for blowing up your Twitter feed with #FredVanVleet 🎲  #NBAAllStar ⭐ tweets!

#WeThe North🏀The Blazers (6-4 ATS last ten) are +7.5 point underdogs in Toronto tomorrow against the Raptors (6-3-1 ATS last ten), per @DKSportsbook. 

What do you think the outcome of the game will be?

#PWEBets@RaptorsHarris @Raptors raptors RT@Raptors rt pls@_mcflyboi_ @stackzzz123 @Raptors @ScottBarnes561 Nah, Barnes was locked down by the Wizards. If you watched the game yesterday.

Raptors have the least selfish team in the league, like i said you are dirty casual.@JoeyTheMisfit @_mcflyboi_ @Lizard_King147 @Raptors @ScottBarnes561 These kids dont watch Basketball.

Wizards locked down on Barnes. They think this is a Soap Opera and VanVleet and Siakam are ignoring Barnes on purpose because i have no fucking idea@BlinkyBurner @Raptors raptors rt W bro@_mcflyboi_ @HR_6IX @Raptors @ScottBarnes561 no i dont want a rookie closing games@BlinkyBurner @Raptors RAPTORS RT’ed WWWWW@jamMills13 @Beer_Browser @jaywanld @ufionbd @PascalFanClub “Literally not one person in Toronto feels that way” then im assuming Masai doesnt live in Toronto bc he definitely does.  What an emotional, envious Raptor fanboy thinks is irrelevant@Raptors @Bell The production on Open Gym has been sub-par this year.

You're clueless.  I watched the game from start to finish.  Teammates didn't act selfish to limit his productivity.  Wizards picked up the defense.  Barnes got himself in the position to demand the ball a lot less.  He missed the opportunities he got.@Raptors ask drake to make a tweet he’s such a bandwagonRetweet if you want to see #FredVanVleet and his mom at #NBAAllStar 🤩

It makes total sense. First a revamp on my TS collection and now team merch. Can't wait to attend my first game. Might even move to the 6ix this year. Let's see.If the Roster had some vets it would definitely help. But trust the process and quit hating on our players. @RaptorsWizards took an L last night to the Raptors 109-105. Barnes had 27, VanVleet had 21 and 12 assists, and Siakam had 21 for Toronto. Beal had 25 and 8 assists and Dinwiddie had 17, 7, and 7 for Washington. Wizards next game is tomorrow at 3:30pm against the Celtics. Who will win?@Raptors easiest ratio in my life on me😭@scottiebetta @LeGoatFan23 @Raptors Ironic@Raptors i was the first like
