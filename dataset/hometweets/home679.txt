The Boston Celtics have emerged as frontrunners to land the All Star guard thanks to his close relationship with Jayson Tatum.@ABigThingBadly @BoredGutterApes @celtics @heckman_eth Can’t believe no one (checked Google images) has photoshopped a Durag on Larry bird. https://t.co/AqYI9UTwNP@ABigThingBadly @BoredGutterApes @celtics @heckman_eth I love that! big Celtics fan here..

Used #6 pick in 18' on him and now he is finally healthy for the first time in his 3rd year. Why in the world would we just give him away.
