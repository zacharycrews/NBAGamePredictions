His effort against Milwaukee that playoffs was flat-out embarrassing, and is the last thing fans remember.@Blake18Foster @sam_kieckhafer @Bucks Good morning Sam, admin and Blake!I'd buy into Bulls fan optimism for Game 2 tonight had Milwaukee not turned the ball over 21 times and Middleton not played a subpar Game 1.  Say the Bulls didn't play a great game all you want, but if you think the Bucks played all that well Sunday, you're living in Fantasy landRevenge Game: Ersan Ilyasova plays Milwaukee tonight.  He played 583 games in his career for the Bucks.@DeerDistrict @Bucks That’s a shame. My husband and I watched the playoff game on the big screen in a blizzard in the Deer District before. Now canceled for “anticipated rain”? Lol.Just a friendly reminder that we have the hottest @Bucks special in the city and we are going up 2-0 tonight 😌 https://t.co/iE4Pe4nzXY@TripodReynolds @Bucks Agreed!! @AlexLasryWI @nbatedLike the Milwaukee offense to get back on track tonight. Game 1 was riddled with nerves and resulted in a bad shooting night for both teams. Bucks during the reg season have always responded with high scoring games after scoring sub 100 points and I expect that trend to continue https://t.co/w9rmTDn2FT#NBAPlayoffs 4/20

https://t.co/RAzw3wePy5The Heat’s starting point guard was a Toronto Raptor, their starting power forward was a Milwaukee Buck, and their starting shooting guard was barely in the rotation. 

It’s a totally different teamIt's playoffs season! Good luck to the @Bucks and @MKEadmirals today💪 #MKEproud https://t.co/xHUc6uYy8sThe Milwaukee Bucks Basketball Organization ❤️👏🏻🏀Coming up in 10 minutes on Wake Up Call w/ @TonyDRadio &amp; @ronnculver, we're talking @Bucks basketball with @alex_strouf

Tune in right now!Being measured in how much #FearTheDeer trash talk I should give @TheRyanHeckman @anishpFS @CampbellJordan_ and the rest of the @DaWindyCityFS crew.

I really don’t want to crush Amish’s hope as well.

#SeeRed #BullsNation #Bucksin4 #BucksIn6 #Bucks #Milwaukee #Chicago@Bullskickass Wouldn’t that be a sweet dream?! It would be their 1st victory after 19 straight losses . But unfortunately dreaming won’t make it come true. I think Milwaukee comes out with a much different attitude tonight and blows our Bulls off the floor.

2021 that Jokic won it,GA was 0-2 in 2 series and 0-1 in 1 series. Jokic deserved last year's MVP,dont know about this year but its a rs award.I think GA34 would have locked it if Brook played all szn.@nathanmarzion Oooh, also, how many times will she even perform in Milwaukee in her career, maybe five tops? I know it's just the "only bucks matter" agenda, but gotta fuel the fire@weareround21 Definitely the Nets.

If Bucks get similar offensive performances from @Jrue_Holiday11 and @Khris22m, Milwaukee is again vulnerable. Bulls really competed on D, and Jrue 🔒🔒on @ZachLaVine in game1.
