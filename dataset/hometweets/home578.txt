POR is currently $3M over the tax. They are 1 of only 2 teams (BOS) that are not contenders but over the tax. Considering they are 9 games under .500 it will be a huge priority to shed salary and almost anyone on the roster could be expendable.The @cavs will play their first game of a 6-game road trip out West tonight when they face the Portland Trail Blazers. Cleveland won their first meeting 107-104 on Nov. 3, led by 24 PTS and 17 REB by @_bigjayy_

#GamblingTwitter@BobbyMarks42 I would love to have Moses Brown back on the @trailblazers@Basketballrugs @ravenwizardd @KendrickPerkins @FirstTake @trailblazers @celtics Not really. Both teams need to mix it up. And neither one will probably trade for Simmons. So why not make that trade and see who else they could get out of the deal with CJ from Portland@ravenwizardd @KendrickPerkins @FirstTake @trailblazers @celtics Yup. He doesn’t know how to coach and it’s showing. I thought he would have helped this team out, but he’s only making them worse and they have less chemistry. It’s time to move a couple of players. CJ being one of them.@Anthony_T411 @KendrickPerkins @FirstTake @trailblazers @celtics Would make sense. I like Portland but they should’ve never hired billups@ravenwizardd @KendrickPerkins @FirstTake @trailblazers @celtics I actually like CJ for Tatum (or Brown). Then McCollum can move back to the PG position.Consensus Line Move:
