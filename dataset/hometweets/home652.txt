#RipCity | #NBA75@jsasser42 @The_ColeAnthony He is absolutely a whole vibe of positivity no matter what and I pray he continues to be very blessed in his career. This is something Orlando Magic needed. 💙#50Happy birthday to earl Clark of the Orlando magic #earlclark #orlandomagic #phoenixsuns #clevelandcavs #clevelandcavaliers #newyorkknicks #newjerseynets https://t.co/KDhQhSNNs5NBA Basketball Game Betting Picks Simulator: 7:10 PM ET - Portland Trail Blazers vs. Orlando Magic - YOU CAN RUN THE GAME SIMULATION FOR FREE HERE: https://t.co/YiCCvUQvip #nba #sportsbetting #freepicks #cappertekJust to let everyone know that the moment a @OrlandoMagic silver comes up I will be begging everyone to make sure I get it hahah https://t.co/UOwnfuVb88@ProvideContext "That Magic team which MJ tortured with Shaq in the middle was a defensive juggernaut." 

1992-93 Orlando Magic
Def Rtg: 107.1 (12th of 27)

64 points on 49 shots, and it's a god-like performance. In a loss

Booker scored 70 on 40 shots, but that L makes it less impressiveLOOLL Warriors are like Orlando Magic without #StephenCurry | #NBAAllStarSprinkling on the @hornets money line at +110. Hornets have had a couple of rest days, and after their loss to @OrlandoMagic I can see them bouncing back and out scoring the @nyknicks. Also taking Gordon Hayward o4.5 Rebs at +100, Bridges o6.5 Rebs at -135, Ball o6.5 Rebs at +100 https://t.co/8HyBeABZbdBjelica is on the roster why again? I have watched this guy play every game since the season started and I am convinced that Looney deserves a statue 😂 Draymond and Bjelica together don't scare anyone but maybe the Orlando magic 🤨Basically we the Orlando magic that just happens to have Lebron 

Orlando always drafted great talent but could never figure it outMagic Johnson was right. Lakers did quit in Denver. Players wearing purple and gold but playing like they repin' Orlando Magic. No heart, not fight, no pride. There are 17 championships in this mf!! Remember that.@OrlandoMagic @TerrenceRoss Half the Bucs got injured after this. Keep the curse with our Magic somebody gotta win lolDisney pass’s ✔️ Universal pass’s✔️ Orlando magic tickets✔️ car hire✔️ visa’s✔️ we’re getting close 😬✈️🇺🇸The Orlando Magic are a bleak 8 - 36. The franchise finally put a stop to years of 6th to 8th seed mediocrity and hit the restart. 

The early signs of the rebuild have been promising and none more promising than the immediate impact of star rookie Franz Wagner;

#NBA https://t.co/lZCOAhtZQyCongratulations to BigJoe114 who moved up 1 spot to take #8 on the Orlando Magic team leaderboard.

I've understood a lot of things about this team
I've come to grow patience for the struggles, and happily cherish the good
That being said
Which player will go down as our first to bring the @OrlandoMagic a 60-win season in the future?@StackingWs @uncommonsense49 @MythNix @AirJordans2323 Yeah, and they got a good player to replace him who went 17/10, not Pete Myers since Shaq didn't leave in October.

The 1997 Orlando Magic went 45-37. If you want to play the same game, the Bulls when both Pippen, Grant played were the best team in the NBA in 94'.Check out 2020 Cole Anthony Donruss Rated Rookie #165 Orlando Magic Pack Fresh! #OrlandoMagic https://t.co/qDUhsRns7B via @eBayJalen Suggs puts up 16 points on 7/11 shooting (0/2 from 3, 2/3 FT) with 3 rebounds, 2 assists, and 3 turnovers in his second game back from injury in a loss vs the Mavericks @jalensuggs @OrlandoMagic@The1stWright Yea that shit was cold look like it was collab w the Orlando Magic’s@hongziyang @ozskier @SkierBW I didn't ski til I moved to Utah but I definitely rocked a starter jacket. Orlando Magic because my folks though the Bulls one was "too violent" 🤦 Shoulda been Celtics anyway.@TakingThePoint5 @chicagobulls @gsalinas013 @NikolaVucevic Orlando yes… the Magic are bums.ON POINT: Raptors 905 hang on for 111-99 win, sweep back-to-back vs Lakeland Magic https://t.co/fCG4CZ3tkI Written by @OliveiraKyle #Raptors905 #Raptors  #RTZ #LakelandMagic #OrlandoMagic #canball #onpoint@NBAHistory @chicagobulls Orlando Magic executed a bad defense@ThomasCrummer @brevinknight22 @PetePranica @thefishnation @memgrizz Welcome to the fold. Awesome team, coaches, front office, broadcast team, team writers, &amp; a fervent fan base with (in my experience) very few assholes. You may have left Orlando, but the "magic" is here. Go Grizzlies!!@E05433456 @SGVNSports Vogel had the Pacers in the playoffs every year he coached even took them to the Eastern Conference finals. He Coached the Orlando Magic as well before he got the Laker job. Instead of just admitting you were wrong about him being a rookie coach you want to take this elsewhereDwight Howard should go back to the  Orlando Magic. There. I said it.Watching a game on NBATV (should be showing live games btw) but it’s Bulls v Orlando from when Mike dropped 60 sum on em. Magic have Kerr, Skiles, and Tom Tolbert on the floor in 4th quarter crunch time. And this was one of the best teams in the league at the time.ORLANDO DAY 2 - MAGIC KINGDOM

Did a few major rides today and we tried out a bunch of different snack foods, like a orange whip float w/ strawberry soda and pop rocks. All the food this trip has been surprisingly high quality! https://t.co/Wu47TQu7C9@ScooterMagruder @OrlandoMagic @TerrenceRoss It’s time to fulfill your end of the deal with @tomgrossicomedy you made at the beginning of the regular season. If the cowboys did not win the Super bowl you have to get a signed jersey of a pro hall of fame player I think.The Blazers (4-6 ATS last ten) are +1 point underdogs in Orlando tomorrow against the Magic (5-5 ATS last ten), per @oregon_lottery.

What do you think the outcome of the game will be?
