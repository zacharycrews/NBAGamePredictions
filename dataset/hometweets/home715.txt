@Hottie4Sports@McTannerV1 You should talk about the 2004-05 Orlando Magic imo and also talk about how Jalen McDaniels is one of the most underrated bench players in the league@OrlandoMagic @SimplyIOA @jalensuggs This team is the epitomy of fun &amp; I'm all for it! It's not going to be easy right now but in a few years if we keep following this trajectory they'll be one of the teams you'll want watch. I'm glad Suggs &amp; co are enjoying the process no matter how hard it's been. #MagicTogetherI do not know if we have been away from @WaltDisneyWorld for so long, or I got jaded by the other park in Orlando. Yet, we are here @DisneySprings and it really feels lackluster. I mean did Bob Chapek really take the magic out of @WaltDisneyCo? The apparel, pins, artwork all seemOrlando has had 2 days off. 😴

Will LA be too exhausted for Clippers 🆚  Magic? Or can they follow up a once-in-a-generation performance after coming back from 35 down to beat the Wizards? 📊

🏀Orlando's win vs Chicago was the first time the Magic had their starting lineup intact in 9+ weeks.
🏀The under is 11-4 in Charlotte's last 15.
🏀The Bucks are 3-8 against the spread in their last 11.

Me : what the fuck is the @OrlandoMagic timeline?!@JerrySnackhouse It’s so sad the bulls for being a big market they are a shit show and have been for years. Can’t even beat the Orlando Magic which is ranked 30th in the league LMAO.  And to top it off he posterized your whole team.@BeenKnightedUCF @Bloomberg1968 @OrlandoMagic @jalensuggs @The_ColeAnthony Told you. Dude acts like a typical close-minded oldhead.@ShadrockQSC @_jgir0 bro an orlando magic fan 🤣🤣🤣🤣@Bloomberg1968 @tankmagictank @OrlandoMagic @jalensuggs @The_ColeAnthony The Magic made the finals in 2009...that has nothing to do with the direction the team is headed right now...that was 13 years ago dude lol@Bloomberg1968 @tankmagictank @OrlandoMagic @jalensuggs @The_ColeAnthony I guess Clifford does have a job, but he is literally just a “consultant”@Bloomberg1968 @tankmagictank @OrlandoMagic @jalensuggs @The_ColeAnthony We have a pretty new front office. None of the coaches we had were good. Look at Vogel rn. Clifford is out of a job. Skiles? Give me a break lol. Mosley wants to be here, as do all the guys. Watch more games, and listen to what the players have to say. Nothing but positivity@tankmagictank @OrlandoMagic @jalensuggs @The_ColeAnthony A playoff team that in back to back years won the first game then was swept 4 games straight. Pretty pathetic playoff appearances. But I’m sure they were just building then too lol@tankmagictank @OrlandoMagic @jalensuggs @The_ColeAnthony Bro why do you think any decent coach come to Orlando for 1 year and leaves🤣 It only takes 1 season for them to see clearly what this organization is all about. I mean godamn even NBA 2k manager mode has the Orlando magic as a franchise whose initiative is sales and merch.@tankmagictank @OrlandoMagic @jalensuggs @The_ColeAnthony Over time you’ll see. Every single player on this team you think is even slightly worth while they will get rid of just to build more space for draft picks and keep the money train going. Meanwhile you’ll still sit in front of the tv saying “This is our year boys” lmaoDamn….@OrlandoMagic u sure Suggs was right call at 5? 🤣 https://t.co/cGu8Yjsvdn@tankmagictank @OrlandoMagic @jalensuggs @The_ColeAnthony I see you like to reference the warriors in the sense of a logical ball club can you explain why every time the magic make the finals they blow up the team ? We just saw phoenix do it did they blow up the team after ?? Nah there not worries about selling high@OrlandoMagic @The_ColeAnthony @jalensuggs @franzboogie Just got my kids tickets to Fridays game! Any way I can get them to take a pic with one of the players this time around! That would make the game more memorable!!! https://t.co/DVF1Hfcpd5@tankmagictank @OrlandoMagic @jalensuggs @The_ColeAnthony Long term goals. They been rebuilding for 30 years lol. The approach is there man draft and build but unfortunately it will take some time for you to see this franchise builds players up to sell them to the highest bidder. This is not Orlando’s team this is Mickey Mouses team.Somehow, Orlando Magic legend Bismack Biyombo is only 29 years oldLadies and gentlemen your Orlando Magic trade deadline!

Does support local not mean anyting when it comes to sports? 
The Lakers are Wal-Mart,the Magic are fresh produce at the farmers market, more effort sure but at the end of the day it tastes better@npgexclusive I ain't never seen an Orlando Magic fan in my life@TheMightyA2 @OrlandoMagic Nice! Have funLETS GOOOOOOOOO! @OrlandoMagic see y’all next saturday! https://t.co/cmsuWgztbt@Bloomberg1968 @OrlandoMagic @jalensuggs @The_ColeAnthony The Warriors weren’t contenders with a flick of a switch. They drafted well, and built their team slow and steady.

This FO is doing it the right way now, and us losing for a couple of seasons is part of the development curve.@Bloomberg1968 @OrlandoMagic @jalensuggs @The_ColeAnthony First of all, we were a playoff team and was trending up, other worldy injuries happened and left the FO no choice. 2020 team has low ceiling and free agents are not going to come here, we had to build everything from scratch and draft.@TRaw9225 @MrThunder0 @AylingGregor @Chrisco47528277 @iDude14 you really out here acting like being in the top 5 for turnovers per-game and top 3 total turnovers is not a bad thing. How much you gotta love this man to defend this especially on a Lebron led team is beyond me. This would be okay on the Orlando Magic not a team looking to win.@Bloomberg1968 @OrlandoMagic @jalensuggs @The_ColeAnthony I don’t even want to explain things to you because you’re not gonna listen. I’ll explain anyway.@MythNix @stickyfingersFR @AirJordans2323 I see you don’t know much about betting. Well, remember Orlando? Odds: Magic +550 / Cavaliers -700
