Sabonis impact on the team has been major. We now have a player who can facilitate the half court O and carry the load for Fox. Also his screens, strength, and rebounding are amazing for a team who hasn’t had a C since boogieNBA Rumors: Julius Randle &amp; Kemba Walker To Sacramento, Harrison Barnes To New York In Proposed Kings-Knicks Deal
https://t.co/gTwEWRsP1w@becausethisisAU @monroah @The_Barnyard0 @OrlandoMagic @SacramentoKings Exactly, don’t let his stats fool you.  JD was the highest ranked recruit in the state of Alabama history, and arguably the greatest player before even stepping on the court.@monroah @The_Barnyard0 @OrlandoMagic @SacramentoKings and if you are still listening and would like to go with a guard instead, JD Davidson might be the best guard in basketball. Give him a look.#NBAPick for tonight's @nyknicks vs @SacramentoKings game.

https://t.co/ECOzmV08fM https://t.co/yBvgRVFbem@The_Barnyard0 @becausethisisAU If @OrlandoMagic or @SacramentoKings are listening…Oscar Tshiebwe is the best overall player and he should definitely be drafted first.VB almost had the Sacramento kings come there … that didn’t work … now this… I’m really feeling like Virginia won’t be able to establish ourselves and have an identity for something. Richmond and 757 needs to unite in some way and make something shake https://t.co/HhvToIZI6tThe @SacramentoKings can burn in hell ain’t nobody watching this game but Knicks fans start it at 7:30 EST🏀 𝗚𝗔𝗠𝗘𝗗𝗔𝗬 🏀

Felling either if these guys would be a great fit.Now if our defence was giving 2019 Raptors we may be okay but it’s giving Sacramento Kings before the trade. Get some shooting. Y’all ain’t playing D no way so what do you care if the shooter can’t defend? 😂@mbiehl31 @Pacers @TyHaliburton22 @SacramentoKings Check Fox's statlines since the trade
