@Raptors @hudsonsbay Grateful for Scottie and Danny’s energy!! Love them both!’🔥❤️@ogDamare @Raptors @Invisalign we beat them w/o og and fred last time lmao@wensparks @Raptors They’ll be there and will be a problem for anyone they face…if healthy. OG is huge for them cause he can guard anyone plus make bigs guard him outside. Hoping the Raps can have a long run. Cheers WendyDanny Green wasn’t with us long, but he’s one of my fave #raptors. He loved &amp; respected our city/fans, still does to this day. He speaks of the team/Toronto with respect &amp; fondness - deserves this night &amp; a standing O. Congrats @DGreen_14 👏🏼

#WeTheNorth@Raptors @Invisalign Good@Raptors @Invisalign okay precious we move.@wensparks @Raptors Love to see it. Knew this team would be fun to watch, and competitive. Pascal Siakam's performance will be a big deciding factor as will health. A healthy Raptors team is a three headed monster on offense as will as lockdown on defence. #WeTheNorth@alekscygal @Raptors @sixers …but for Toronto to come away with the W. 😏@Raptors @Invisalign I mean… I guess they answered my prayers and started achiuwa… but khem birch is still there😐@Raptors @Invisalign That spacing is atrocious.

We love an underdog and take nothing for granted - and our team thrives on that footing.Let's go!!!! Time to show another top team in the East that they best respect us! Trust me... You don't want to face the Raptors in the playoffs.  Championship DNA? Check.  Big game coming up!

@Raptors | #WeTheNorth https://t.co/70fChT5yry@wensparks @Raptors All I can say is being a Raps fan is as close as you can get to fan nirvana. No matter what happens to this team, we always find a way. We about to make some noise this playoffs. And no matter what happens, we are playing with House money. Our future is absolute 🔥 https://t.co/2014TxtXup@wensparks @Raptors And I think what makes us most dangerous come playoff time is that we have nothing to lose.

There are a lot of teams with a lot of pressure on them to win now or a lot to prove but we are playing with house money at this point. Every game is a win because it helps us get better.Toronto got the best of Philadelphia in their last matchup, and we like Canada's team to win again on Thursday night. The Sixers will be without lockdown wing Matisse Thybulle, and that will prove costly. Find out more in our 76ers vs. Raptors picks.

Only difference this time is no one has championship expectations,  we know we are developing for the next and after season.

So anything from now on is just gravy.@wensparks @Raptors Super happy that they qualified for the playoffs and not just the play-in. It’s been an amazing season. Anything they do in the playoffs is a bonus. Excited to watch 😊@wensparks @Raptors The best organization in the NBA, taking over the legacy of the Spurs, who became the model of consistency.

Not a bad thing with a key roleplayer like Thybulle ineligible to play in Toronto.@Raptors @hudsonsbay one of the flyest in the league@KyleNeubeck I think we lose in 6 to toronto without matisse away and in 5 to Nets...he has put this team in a very very ugly situation where NOW they may have to play harden Embiid starters to win out to avoid raptors..cannot tell u how angry i am at this team doesnt matter selfish dudeHey Raps fam, I’m so interested in hearing your thoughts about the @Raptors making the playoffs. Drop a comment below. 🦖🔥🏀@Raptors Imagine this lol what timing. Turns around to his team to show Embid the ring he lost out on because of Kawhi. Raps trolling Philly bad with this one 😂@Sportsnet @Raptors @DGreen_14 @michaelgrange Just as important? I dunno bout all that1-1 in MLB today, let’s go #NBA

76ers ML (-145) DK

Philly won two straight in Toronto and are 8-2 on the ML away from home with James Harden.

I’d say Raptors are safely the No. 5 seed with Rockets and Knicks next.
This game means more for 76ers and Embiid (MVP, scoring title). https://t.co/EUH0PJN86O🚨 Line Change 🚨

The MLB season kicks off today. I am looking to have MY BIGGEST season ever. 

MLB
Milwaukee Brewers -182 Chicago Cubs (2:20 PM)
San Diego Padres vs Arizona Diamondbacks OVER 9 -110 (9:40 PM)

NBA
Philadelphia 76ers vs Toronto Raptors OVER 218 -110 (7:40 PM)Matisse Thybulle was ruled ineligible to play against the Raptors on their road trip to Toronto. 

As of Jan. 15, players need to be fully vaccinated to enter Canada.

https://t.co/WksyE56BGU@NBA @LAClippers @npowell2404 Powell. We miss you in Toronto. What a great team we had back then.... 
@Raptors  @npowell2404@AdamKoffler I don’t think Canada enforced their mandate until January which is why he was able to play in the first game in Toronto earlier this season. But if 76ers/Raptors face off in the playoffs he won’t be able to play road gamesGood article outlining why Matisse may be ineligible to play in Toronto. Very likely he’s the unvaccinated Sixer player. It will be interesting what he decides to do if the Sixers play the Raptors in the first round https://t.co/6lsj3dF7Y6It's funny looking at the @espn pre-season predictions for the #Toronto @Raptors -- they predicted a 35-47 record:

What are the chances of a Cdn candidate being voted in.  US media is quite dismissive of the Raptors team no matter how good they are!!  #ScottieBarnesROY@DerozanFan10 @loveisourfiller @ice_moke @RapsMuse @Raptors You ignore the fact you have two all stars and Cade has been playing without Jerami Grant basically all year. Super Reach there Stretch. Lol@RGK91605631 @loveisourfiller @ice_moke @RapsMuse @Raptors You ignore the fact that Barnes took over the spots of Van Vleet, GTJ, OG, Pascal and Birch when they were injured.

@SimuLiu@bballbreakdown would thybulle missing road games in a Philly Toronto series lead to a raptors win https://t.co/MJb4xd5aPL@loveisourfiller @RGK91605631 @ice_moke @RAPSMUSE @Raptors Pistons record (without or with Cade):
3-14: 18% 
20-43: 32%
Current record is 23-57 with 2 gms left. Win both gms= 25-57.

Assume Cade plays all 82 gms. Applying the same 32%,  Pistons would have won:

32% of 82 = 26 games (26-56 vs 25-57).

With or w/o Cade, same result. 🤣Matisse Thybulle is ineligible to play in Toronto on Thursday because he is not vaccinated. 

If the season ended today, the Philadelphia 76ers would play the Toronto Raptors in the 1st round of the playoffs.
