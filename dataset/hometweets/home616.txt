https://t.co/UBPUX6y2EO@wiscoloko11 @CarlosS29143608 @Bucks @SacramentoKings @WiSportsHeroics Because the Bucks didn't send scouts to Portland or New Orleans. This may come as a shock but we write about what's reported on. The Bucks could be interested in hiring a water boy from Sacramento for all we know.@wiscoloko11 @BucksinVA @Bucks @SacramentoKings @WiSportsHeroics Everyone here is dumber after reading your comment, which was totally unnecessary given his conclusion@CarlosS29143608 @BucksinVA @Bucks @SacramentoKings @WiSportsHeroics Good enough at reading to recognize a trash article yeah. Lol why dont we discuss trading for Dame or Brandon Ingram or some other 30mil a year player while we are at it. Its all moot if we cant make those trades.. so why mention it all with regards to the Bucks?The 2022 Sacramento Kings would eviscerate the 96 bulls https://t.co/YuC7FPhk0a@SacramentoKings @LouisKing i truely feel we need to give Louis MIN!! we were so close the last few weeks but he had to go to protocol like others had, it was the perfect chance to have him getting min. Promising player@BucksinVA @BJarumbo @Bucks @SacramentoKings @WiSportsHeroics Funny your article didnt highlight that it would require dealing one of our best 3 players. Seems like an important caveat that a paid writer would want to include in a trade article. 🧐😑 and you are welcome if you want my input before you put out your next article im here.@wiscoloko11 @BucksinVA @Bucks @SacramentoKings @WiSportsHeroics U don’t read do uOwners that keep fielding shit teams should have to sell. You get 10 years, you keep fielding garbage? You sell. Pegulas.. gone, Kahn.. gone. Whatever assholes own the Pirates, gone. Sacramento Kings Owners buh-bye https://t.co/pE16DcMclb@CoachCGoodman @JuwanHoward I was thinking Chris Webber. But that's what I get for being a @SacramentoKings fan.@kayte_c @SacramentoKings @Lakers @Golden1Center Thank you so much 😭@taylorlpate Sacramento Kings@kayte_c @jmeanz @SacramentoKings @Lakers @Golden1Center Congrats man! 😭@wiscoloko11 @BJarumbo @Bucks @SacramentoKings @WiSportsHeroics ...Which is part of the reason why I'm not in favor of trading for Fox. Fox is still a commonly discussed trade asset.

Regardless, thank you for your input from your wealth of experience in journalism.@kayte_c @SacramentoKings @Lakers @Golden1Center A way to end a long day from work!!! And the golden1center is super close by to my clinic!!@BJarumbo @BucksinVA @Bucks @SacramentoKings @WiSportsHeroics Hence why I asked if someone is paying him to type rubbish. 😂 write a trade article that could actually happen.. not that hard if this is dudes job..(i hope it is not)After @BrooklynNets vs @chicagobulls, @CignalTV will air @Lakers vs @SacramentoKings at 1:30 pm with @MarkJonesESPN on the call.@big_will88 @SacramentoKings @mikebibbycom Man I even had mom n pops being die hard fans back then. Great memories. Should of been our year@CaveManVampire @SacramentoKings That Horry shot stunted my growth as a kind human being.@BJarumbo @BucksinVA @Bucks @SacramentoKings @WiSportsHeroics Doesnt take a genius to find out DFox makes 28 million a year. Or that Bucks would need to match 90% of that in out going salaries. Or roughly 25mill. So to get to that number we trade either everone on the team not named jrue/khris/giannis or would have to include one. 🤷🏻‍♂️@jmeanz @SacramentoKings @Lakers @Golden1Center I like this one! Very unique answer. Congratulations the tickets are yours! Check your DM for instructions@bkoontz41 @SacramentoKings @mikebibbycom Lol man it’s been awhile. I remember seeing that headline in the paper ! Thought you guys were winning it that year@kennythomasnba @KyleDraperTV @KingJames @Lakers @Matt_Barnes22 @NBCSKings @SacramentoKings Kenny, we are KINGS FANS!! But, LAL will win...@wiscoloko11 @BucksinVA @Bucks @SacramentoKings @WiSportsHeroics It could be that a good chunk of Bucks fans want big name trades, and Todd is dispelling those ideas. Not every Bucks fan has a masters degree in trade mechanics like yourself (allegedly).@sobylife @SacramentoKings Power moveThere’s no way Russell Westbrook has 10 turnovers vs the @SacramentoKings .. no way I think , maybe, perhaps 🤔 https://t.co/NqixC7qEvj@BJarumbo @BucksinVA @Bucks @SacramentoKings @WiSportsHeroics Lol again dont care what his conclusion was…. He brought up a trade target that we cannot get without trading Giannis/Jrue/Khris. He doesnt even acknowledge this 😂 that is the clown show part i am calling out..@kayte_c @SacramentoKings @Lakers @Golden1Center Bogi beats the buzzer!!@kayte_c @SacramentoKings @Lakers @Golden1Center It's  been so long ago I can't recall a victory worth any meaning.... so long..... ago...@wiscoloko11 @BucksinVA @Bucks @SacramentoKings @WiSportsHeroics I’m fairly certain that anyone who clicked on the article, and read it, would’ve seen that @BucksinVA came to the conclusion that were probably not making a trade.

#NBA75 #NBAAllStar #NBATopShotThis@BucksinVA @Bucks @SacramentoKings @WiSportsHeroics So essentially got to the Fox portion and realized this must be an idiot writing this article and stopped to ask if you get paid to type up rubbish. So conclusion or not bringing up Fox is an error on your part my guy..@BucksinVA @Bucks @SacramentoKings @WiSportsHeroics I skimmed it. But let me ask this, why bring up DFox at all? When it would require Jrue or Khris..? U could have mentioned Harrison Barnes, Bagley, Holmes, but no you chose to write DFox as a trade target..Which is assine n shows your lack of understanding of NBA trade mechanicsIt’s @KingJames and the @Lakers tonight!

Your trade is legit just a one way trade, any Celtics fan would like to see but why would kings do that?…LOOK for Sacramento to make a significant trade.

Like if the Jacksonville Jaguars and Sacramento Kings somehow won the championshipsI’ve been saying this since last year but maybe Sacramento can get lucky and trade all of there players after 15 years of no playoffs. The kings need an expansion team@JHBBN23 @EricPincus @BleacherReport The trade for Sacramento Kings Buddy Hield was almost complete and THT was not included, nice try kiddo. 😂😂
The trade for 22.5 million dollar Buddy didn’t take as many players as Westbrook’s 44 million dollar salary.We pray for another neemias game tonight @SacramentoKingsThree Things to Know: Lakers at Kings - 1/12/22 | Los Angeles Lakers (Los Angeles Lakers)

 #LA_LakersNBA Basketball Game Betting Picks Simulator: 1/12/2022 10:08 PM ET - Los Angeles Lakers vs. Sacramento Kings - YOU CAN RUN THE GAME SIMULATION FOR FREE HERE: https://t.co/ZV6w8jPD3a #nba #sportsbetting #freepicks #cappertekThe Sacramento Kings are one of the NBA's worst run teams but despite all the dysfunction, they've somehow found themselves in a favourable position with 3 strong creators in the team. Dysfunction got them to this point I hope it doesn't take them out of it.

#NBA https://t.co/NtBJ4TToat@MagnusSav Just like James Harden and Ben Simmons were no happy with their teams they didn't play until they got traded, @swipathefox  if he is not happy with the @SacramentoKings he can do the same..I thinks it’s safe to say that Coby White would be the #2 option on these teams:

@DetroitPistons 
@SacramentoKings 
@OrlandoMagic 
@HoustonRockets 
@okcthunder 
@trailblazers 
@spurs 
@LAClippers 
@warriors 
@WashWizards 
@nyknicks 
@ATLHawks 
@Raptors 

No argument is valid@MJ22inthelab Fun to watch. Take it easy on my kings tomorrow bruh. Hopefully Woj send the tweet. Ben Simmons pulling up in Sacramento.the Sacramento Kings play basketball tomorrow 🙄

try to do everything within your power to be happy until then.

goodnight everybody. https://t.co/W2QHIG9VME@HarrisonWind Lets be honest, the ideal coach for the Nuggets would be Dave Joerger...did a great job in Sacramento before getting fired for no reason by Divac.. did a great job in Memphis and with the Kings in the 18/19 season

39-43 was their best record in how long?
@DLineCo @Adam_MaresThis goes for every young small market scrub team that comes into Los Angeles:
#Grizzlies 
#Timberwolves 
#okcthunder 
#sacramentokings 
#HoustonRockets 
#Spurs 
Who'd I miss 🤔 https://t.co/X6NMrYym4H@Jason Can we get randle and Ingram to the @SacramentoKingsThe Sacramento Kings really are the worst franchise ever. Still can’t believe they wasted Davion Mitchell’s time and ours, by drafting him.@StocktonKings @SacramentoKings @Rich_Holmes22 @TerenceDavisJr 10.3 million per year to the D League.  Keeps getting better@RichCampbellPhD No, Sir. I was not wanted by the #sacramentokings this season. Maybe that changes in the future. But you can see me on #FS1 this Saturday night doing #USC vs. #Oregon basketball 🏀 📺@MsLaydeeLala Yes! I did this in Sacramento at the theater next to Kings arena. I was there for work and just wanted popcorn 😃@ShamsCharania Think that would have happened sooner if they were Sacramento Kings instead?@lovethyKings @DaveLack @apevny @SacramentoKings @Vivek Ya that's not a whole lot of red@HeuristicLineup @DaveLack @apevny @SacramentoKings @Vivek Wow, doesn’t look like a lot of STH to me. 😳The New Orleans Pelicans, a team that has yet to see their superstar play this season, just caught up to Sacramento in the standings.

The Kings are now tied for 12th/13th in the Western Conference, and they’re in a virtual tie for the 5th pick in the NBA Draft.Not abandoning my @SacramentoKings (17 long years a fan) by any stretch, it's just now that we're living 3 1/2 hours from the @memgrizz... I may have to start paying closer attention to this team.
10 in a row! https://t.co/LsDdzCz9lTFox deserves so much better than this horrible Sacramento Kings team. They’ve never prioritized spacing in his 5 years.@memgrizz give me old school Sacramento Kings Vibez! They’re fun to watch!!!@TeamBagley @MarkJonesESPN @MB3FIVE They should've called a foul when @SacramentoKings drafted that FLOP #2 overall.The only good thing about the Sacramento Kings right now: https://t.co/0aSKAR2q2B@Lakers vs @SacramentoKings tomorrow night and I dont think either teams deserve my hard earned money. $300 to watch subpar basketball 🥴WHY WON'T THE NBA SHUT DOWN THIS FRAUDSTER WHO EXPLOITS WOMEN BY POSING AS A SACRAMENTO KINGS PLAYER ?

@NBA @ESPNNBA @nbastatsKings could have two players out vs Lakers  Wednesday #LosAngelesLakers #SacramentoKings https://t.co/tdcKLlulvM@DrGuru_ Forgot about the very skilled and veteran Sacramento KingsThere’s no reason why the Sacramento Kings can’t rebuild like the Memphis Grizzlies did@RyanPohl34 @Bucks @Giannis_An34 @WashWizards @SacramentoKings @nyknicks @NBA Bucks should trade both their key big guys and every role player for Bradley Beal?
