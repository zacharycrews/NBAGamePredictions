Shooting? Poku is a sniper.
Poku is known for his elite passing.
LeBron doesn't play defense (Poku is top-tier).
Poku will out-muscle and out-rebound Bron any day.

Looks like making fun of Mayor Clown Shoes is the only fun I can afford with Strickland wages.The Memphis Grizzlies are more like a 5-8 seed this year still running off of last year’s overachieving season. They will pull back. Lost some productive rotation players. Jaren Jackson Jr. isn’t 100-percent.
