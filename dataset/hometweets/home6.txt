The Memphis Grizzlies wanted either 2 first round picks (including Philly's) for this upcoming draft, or #3 overall pick K.J. Allen in JiDion Shaq negotiations.

We now know neither took place, as Shaq is a member of the Charlotte Hornets.@MtmaRpodcast Part 2 for the night action. @Charlieo1320 @memgrizz -7, @celtics v @nyknicks under 217.5.

Over. Just barely. Last year's team was on pace for 43 wins in a regular 82-game season, and I'm not sure they got any better or how much I trust JJJ &amp; Steven Adams to stay healthy, but I think they only need a little luck to get over this total.TONIGHT'S MATCHUP: Your @memgrizz take on @cavs tonight @FedExForum wearing their Beale St. Blue Statement Jerseys.

Rare talent.@price21 @wojespn @jarenjacksonjr @memgrizz @CAA_Basketball That's as good a reason as any. In other words, he's a great catch.@SharonShyBrown @memgrizz Evvie McKinney is a truly talented singer, and its a shame she didn't get more of a fair deal from being on The Four. For being it's initial winner, she should have gotten more than a single.@cavs could’ve left that in the drafts but hey go off 😂

Its basically about the market size regarding marketing. Golden State outsells Phoenix every time. Players desire would be San Francisco over Phoenix every time. I'm a Memphis Grizzlies fan, trust me I know this.On this, #OpeningNight of the 75th @NBA season, I am pleased and proud to proclaim that at long last, I finally have a home in The League:

Most indoor closed arenas will be doing this. They've already started with some concertsWhat Memphis Grizzlies fans spend at FedExForum and how that compares to other NBA fan bases: "That Grizzlies fans spend the seventh-least on food and drinks at games can be partly attributed to the fact that they are getting more bang for their buck."  https://t.co/tIgIE0vd0vIt’s still fuck iggy for not wanting to play for @memgrizzThe Memphis Grizzlies play regular season basketball tomorrow 😎@playboicolli @KenNewhouse1 @GrizzliesPR @memgrizz @cavs Not at most, at least.

That's just when they are re-evaluating him. It's a PR thing the Grizz front office does so they don't have to say someone will be out a long time. They might very well know it'll be longer.@mali3035 @KingJosiah54 Minn vs. Memphis in the Memphis Grizzlies’ 3rd Annual Honorable Play-In Game will be a dunkfest for the ages@memgrizz Birthday suit@BereftOfTheDial @memgrizz Good point on Memphis Grizzlies comparison.
I agree, gets straight to the point, I like it.@memgrizz Grizz Air Max 95s. Will be good to finally be back to put them to use.Today's the first day of #NBA75 - here's who I'm going for:

NBA East:
@DetroitPistons 
@ATLHawks 

NBA West:
@PelicansNBA 
@memgrizz@lakers @Timberwolves @memgrizz Y’all ready?????@thebearto @ChrisBHaynes Typo? Hate when my keyboard autocorrects Utah Jazz to Memphis Grizzlies. 

Who’s coming out?@Haleseclark @memgrizz Will not miss it 😎Steven Adams, the Memphis Grizzlies center from New Zealand, visits with The Daily Memphian and discusess Elvis Presley, the Peabody ducks, barbecue and much more.  https://t.co/2Kb6inMEE6Grayson Allen - Memphis Grizzlies

[FD(29.8: 6.3X) DK(29.5: 7.8X)]@memgrizz Between this post and the picture below, you’ve given me and @leah_buege some hope for teal in an alternate jersey this season 🙏 cc: @MainStMemphis https://t.co/gY788grHho@Johnathen_Adams @vegasfeverpod @ScottyDrowned @Lakers @nuggets @Suns @utahjazz @warriors @dallasmavs @LAClippers @memgrizz @trailblazers @PelicansNBA @DSM_Media My reasoning behind the 7 seed is simply because Kawhi will miss some time through out this season. 

Depending on when he’s back could change it for me.@_ScottyTalks @vegasfeverpod @ScottyDrowned @Lakers @nuggets @Suns @utahjazz @warriors @dallasmavs @LAClippers @memgrizz @trailblazers @PelicansNBA @DSM_Media Idk exactly but they won’t be in the play in. Probably 5-3 seed@Haleseclark @memgrizz I wish@FedExForum @memgrizz I’ve been vaccinated, have a card, and have been offered a free ticket to the games from a friend. Pullin for um but my card is in the top right drawer of my desk, and will stay there.@memgrizz Me plz I’ve been trying for over a year. @iLoveJmorantMemphis Grizzlies https://t.co/bwDKpAbrbIYYYYYEEEESSS!!!!
