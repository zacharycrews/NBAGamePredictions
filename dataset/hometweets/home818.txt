Cleveland in the playoffs… The vibe 🤟🏾@lsn92620 @WonnorCLE @King0fCleveland @cavs @CarisLeVert He’s resting his back after showing obvious discomfort during games. He probably could play but it wouldn’t be good in the long run if he can’t get that rest. Plus the team probably needed him to sit so they could figure out how to make offense without him.@cavs @CarisLeVert It’s beautiful@1RahmaB @lsn92620 @King0fCleveland @cavs @CarisLeVert Yea fr apparently back pain means you can’t have fun but YOU have to play a full NBA game@lsn92620 @WonnorCLE @King0fCleveland @cavs @CarisLeVert I think at this point they’re making sure he’s close to 100%. His back was pretty jacked up. Especially when we’re playing teams like the pacers and rockets and shit that’s the perfect opportunity to sit himFormer Zenit star @kevinpangos is set for a Russian return with @cskabasket per @gazzetta_gr and @chrisalucard. No deal yet... Pangos had joined the @cavs over the summer making 3 starts (23 games) and averaged 7.1 minutes with a 32.6% FG before moving to the G-League #euroleague https://t.co/57pnRTL3tR@BigMikevilla123 oops 😬 @cavs@WonnorCLE @King0fCleveland @cavs @CarisLeVert If you have ever had a back injury, especially lower back then falling back like that and jumping is a large challenge. Since he’s able to do both indicates that he’s fine and it’s simply load management. Which is fine, but don’t call it a back injury if he’s just sitting out.@ErinDeeHuber @Flash_Garrett @MayorBibb @Browns @NBAAllStar @cavs What is this gif?!?!@cavs @CarisLeVert This picture is 🔥🔥🔥@cavs @CarisLeVert LETS GOOOO!! #LetEmKnow@untouchable_06 @cavs @CarisLeVert @_bigjayy_ @jbbickerstaff_ For your sake let's hope he gives the cavs atleast 30 games a season.

Not the main team in this trade but have come out winners with getting Jarret Allen, an all star level player, for basically a Milwaukee 2022 first and their own 2024 second.54 games into the season and the @cavs are fourth in the East. If this has all been a covid-related fever dream don't wake me up. Lock down D and team hustle in attack is my kind of ball.

Dad said I asked him 
“Dad, why doesn’t Shawn Kemp play defense?”
I noticed that he wouldn’t cross half court sometimes or sprint to play defense while the opposing team had the ball.
