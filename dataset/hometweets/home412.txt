What to watch as our holiday homestand kicks off tonight 📝Raptors Bet Sacramento 124-101 last night . Taking on Brooklyn nets tonight, time to clutch up . 
#WeTheNorth🏀 Toronto (106.2) @ Brooklyn (105.2)

The Nets are dealing with an outbreak of players in Health and Safety protocols and Kevin Durant is now questionable with an ankle injury. This screams ugly Raptors win.

Value: Under 215, Nets Team Total u110, Raptors +5If I'm the Brooklyn Nets, I'd feel a certain type of way about Kyrie. If I was them, after this season, if it's possible, I'd leave the Nets.

 #Brooklyn_Nets@CMilholenSB Agree, especially as the Bulls and Bucks just lost, leaving them both two games back of Brooklyn.

After last year, I think Nets *really* want the first seed to avoid the 2/3 matchup. But, to manage loads, they’d prefer to win it by as few games as humanly possible.#NBA

🔒 Toronto are 16-4 SU in their last 20 games against Brooklyn.
🔒 Brooklyn are 2-11 SU in their last 13 games when playing at home against Toronto.
