Lamelo does his best but it seems like it‚Äôs hard for him to get in his rhythm with Gordon out there slowing down the tempo. #tradegordonhayward@hornets @NovantHealth When the nitty gritty comes this team folds like a cheap ass beer can. No toughness they are dominated by good centers and scared to drive and challenge them hell put young guys in and have them drive in hard trying to get them in foul trouble.

@warriors: Jakob Poeltl
@spurs: Oubre &amp; Wiseman + picks
@hornets: Thad &amp; Eubanks

GSW gets a beefs up their bigs. CHA gets a versatile big and lessen their wing players. SAS rebuilds, let Wiseman develop w/o rush.

I‚Äôll say it again: no one hates the Charlotte Hornets and their fans more than local blue checkmarks. https://t.co/eziiWLMRRn@ZakZevchik @HonestTrumpster @hornets He was fouled prior to the shooting motion.

Bad look‚Ä¶ like refs were ‚Äúfixing‚Äù the game.@ZakZevchik @ayecee17 @hornets I‚Äôm saying the situation of it is worse not the actually call.

How the fuck did you give a dead ball 4-point play? This is fucking embarrassing@ZakZevchik @HonestTrumpster @hornets Yes but he was 110% not in the act of shooting. And not in the bonus, should've been cavs shooting for the win with 1.2 seconds left not hornets. And it should've been Hayward free throws on the other end prior@GSpillmanNC @Andrunas45 @hornets @NBAOfficial There was a whistle 4 seconds before terry shot the ball lmao what are you talking about. Why do you think everyone paused@hornets @HornetsPR  Poor coaching by Borrego cost Hornets the game. Borrego killed the momentum by taking Rozier out of the game when they were 10 points up &amp; Rozier had scored twice as many points as anyone in the game. Killed the momentum. Must didn‚Äôt want him Rozier to shine!@cav v @hornets officiating underlines suspect calls &amp; how they turn a game on their questionable calls. First yr, have watched @NBA, but the officiating is in the least puzzling, if not obstructionist. Some Ts are questionable, possibly wrong üòè. Looks dangerous in üóë area.@hornets @Lowes One robbed by the refs@CHA_ttuuse @_mcflyboi_ @fathersexton @loho_ @caymiendavis @hornets ??? What have the Hornets ever accomplished?

Did you see Lamelo on the bench in the inbound play? The best System known to man.

Im here to tell you... Welcome bck to where you belong.

The 9 seed! Congratulations!!!!@brownsfandom @Andrunas45 @hornets @NBAOfficial It was not a dead ball. Play was blown dead after that happened.I wonder if during a timeout, the refs tonight in Charlotte would allow me to saunter on the court and hit a layup for the Hornets@Gelo_41 @ZakZevchik @HonestTrumpster @hornets They're both absolutely shocking decisions and these officials shouldn't touch another nba game.

You can‚Äôt comprehend your own logic, there was no worse call then that"Stick together. Nobody said it was going to be easy."

First you take the all star game away from the city then your snub our players from the game.@hornets Got what you deserved.@dawgfan1800 @hornets Don‚Äôt get me wrong, Hayward was fouled, but calls get missed often during live play.

Perfect example. Hornets had a fastbreak except Mobley was back and Charlotte didn't attack the paint. Also great pass to Allen for a and-1 in crunch time@GianCarloPadua1 @hornets Not even Garland playing we winning by 30 if he is@KulbokasBurner @nelly_lll @hornets it was a dead ball bum@hornets I understand your all‚Äôs pain.

Not even Mikal Jordan can save you #CantFly@LehoustonFan @HonestTrumpster @hornets There was no worse call then giving a team 4 free points on a dead play that was ruled out of bounds already lol. That propelled the Hornets back into the game lol. They were down 10.The refs gave Charlotte 3 points due to a Cavs' player on the bench touching a Hornets' player shooting a 3 after the whistle. I say pass interference in the end zone should be 6 points!  
#spotfoul@Tony_Pesta Hornets announcers were crying about the game being stolen? THAT'S RICH!

I sincerely hope the NBA reviews the play that just happened and disciplines the refs.

How do you count the bucket when the shot comes WAY after the whistle blows?

Makes absolutely NO sense. @cavs @hornets @NBAI'm confused how was @hornets was just awarded 3 points and he missed the shot ü§îWhat just happened in Charlotte? That technical foul and 3-pointer was dumb. #Cavs #Hornetsobviously I need @Hornets to win this game!!@hornets @MELOD1P WAIT HOW TF DID THE HORNETS GET 3 POINTS???@NBA get involved in this @cavs @hornets game.  A 3 was awarded the hornets after the ball was whistled out of bounds.  Complete nonsense.How in the hell @hornets just got 3 points plus a F/TThe refs just had an insane blunder in the Cavs/Hornets game and then Td up Bickerstaff after. 4 point play for Charlotte when it shoulda been ball side out of bounds.

4th quarter and Charlotte needs to heat up, trailing by 11.@KyleBaileyClub @hornets Yup exactly. We‚Äôre dangerous if we‚Äôre running and dunking and our shots are falling. But that‚Äôs a lot of ifs to try to make up for giving up the paintCAN WE TRADE EVERYONE EXCEPT MELO, MILES AND THE ROOKS ???
