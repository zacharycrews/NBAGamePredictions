He sits lamello down at the time he should  e learning in the fourth quarter.  Instead of taking him out when they trying to catch up. This should be a learning phase for Mello.

Why is this necessary and not a delay of game or something?  It’s completely unnecessary and adds more confusion.  You dont see batters in baseball picking up the ball and hitting it in the standsThe @hornets have been a fourth quarter team!

https://t.co/A4fVJqZ9Yq@KevLAbeast @hornets It’s not a pullover?The @hornets need to trade Gordon Hayward before the deadline. He’s causing so many issues with their offense especially. Lamelo does his best but it seems like it’s hard for him to get in his rhythm with Gordon out there slowing down the tempo. #tradegordonhayward@hornets @NovantHealth When the nitty gritty comes this team folds like a cheap ass beer can. No toughness they are dominated by good centers and scared to drive and challenge them hell put young guys in and have them drive in hard trying to get them in foul trouble. Since refuse to acknowledge center@KevLAbeast @hornets Hey beast I know you have one of these, but I saw it today and thought it would look damn good in your bedroom.

The package of Ish Smith + a future second round pick has been discussed, says the source.Not a perfect trade (just a framework to build on). 
@warriors: Jakob Poeltl
@spurs: Oubre &amp; Wiseman + picks
@hornets: Thad &amp; Eubanks

GSW gets a beefs up their bigs. CHA gets a versatile big and lessen their wing players. SAS rebuilds, let Wiseman develop w/o rush.

@Hornets #Hornets #NBA @NBA@hornets If you consider 5 pts close! You need to subtract 4 points that were inexcusably gifted.Officiating meltdown in 4th quarter of Cavs-Hornets last night. Whistle blows twice, baseline ref points to baseline, and Rozier nonchalantly misses a 3 while Ed Davis slaps at him. 

Refs gave Rozier the 3 points and called a tech on Davis! Basically handed Charlotte 4 points https://t.co/d3QjaaJjET@rdr2374 @hornets *4 even…😉@ItsMeDoublEE @BrianPotts6 @hornets I am fairly certain that the official estimate was closer to 1.3 million.

And it should've been Hayward free throws on the other end prior@GSpillmanNC @Andrunas45 @hornets @NBAOfficial There was a whistle 4 seconds before terry shot the ball lmao what are you talking about. Why do you think everyone paused@hornets @HornetsPR  Poor coaching by Borrego cost Hornets the game. Borrego killed the momentum by taking Rozier out of the game when they were 10 points up &amp; Rozier had scored twice as many points as anyone in the game. Killed the momentum. Must didn’t want him Rozier to shine!@cav v @hornets officiating underlines suspect calls &amp; how they turn a game on their questionable calls. First yr, have watched @NBA, but the officiating is in the least puzzling, if not obstructionist. Some Ts are questionable, possibly wrong 😏. Looks dangerous in 🗑 area.@hornets @Lowes One robbed by the refs@CHA_ttuuse @_mcflyboi_ @fathersexton @loho_ @caymiendavis @hornets ??? What have the Hornets ever accomplished? LmaoAllen with a massive stat line today!

Refs missed a lot of calls on both sides.@thrillfocused @CorreaToNYYPls @hornets "Dead ball" isn't an excuse, IT'S A RULE. Once the whistle blows, no points can be scored unless, it's an "and 1"@hornets @drpepper Charlotte!!!! Gordon was there aint he ur hero ? Wht happen???

You don't need no Big u hve PJ

Did you see Lamelo on the bench in the inbound play? The best System known to man.

Im here to tell you... Welcome bck to where you belong.

The 9 seed! Congratulations!!!!@brownsfandom @Andrunas45 @hornets @NBAOfficial It was not a dead ball. Play was blown dead after that happened.I wonder if during a timeout, the refs tonight in Charlotte would allow me to saunter on the court and hit a layup for the Hornets@Gelo_41 @ZakZevchik @HonestTrumpster @hornets They're both absolutely shocking decisions and these officials shouldn't touch another nba game. I'm saying two major errors in the final 7 seconds  was much more important that the other dumb missed call@DJsRawUncutTru1 @hornets Mercy.😂💯 I pray we can turn it around.🙏🏾@GSpillmanNC @hornets @NBAOfficial When was this?@hornets Your officials was trying so hard to get you guys a win and you guys still choked💀💀@hornets Again how many times does LaMelo sit down the stretch in pursuit of the 7 seed?@Panthers8996 @hxpeball @hornets Your team was granted 4 free points on the back of the worst call in NBA history@HornetsOnBally @hornets oh shut upDebating switching teams. Now that I’m actually in Charlotte with the most exciting team in basketball and I only liked the Nets because of DLo… Can I be a Hornets fan now?I swear the NBA is finding new and creative ways to disrespect the @hornets.@ThatGuyKy_7 @hornets Yep. That’s why they gave them 4 points on a dead ball.@hornets get #NoRespect from @NBA https://t.co/YeNdkur6bc@GSpillmanNC @Andrunas45 @hornets @NBAOfficial Bench player can’t touch a player during play, it was a dead ball.@LehoustonFan @ZakZevchik @HonestTrumpster @hornets So a missed call or an interpretation foul is worse then play being stopped and ruled out of bounds, to well after the whistle a player shooting a 3 and hitting it suddenly counts and is considered a tech? You can’t comprehend your own logic, there was no worse call then that"Stick together. Nobody said it was going to be easy."

Head Coach James Borrego talks to the media after a close and controversial loss to the Cavs. 

#AllFly | @hornets https://t.co/FEG0r2HYyUCleveland gets the 102-101 win over the Hornets in Charlotte:

◻️ Jarrett Allen: 29 PTS, 22 REB
◻️ Kevin Love: 25 PTS, 9 REB

The Cavs are now 10-3 in their last 13 games.

Might need to update that prescription bro.@Andrunas45 @hornets @NBAOfficial NBA rule states a bench player cannot touch a player shooting a three. Blame Ed Davis. He even knew it was a foul. That's why he did not argue it.@Reflog_18 DeRosa! Can't wait to see NBA 2 minute report...that bogus 3 points and tech the refs gave to Hornets when the ball should be taken out bounds. Charlotte would have lost by 3!!@hornets Well really you lost by 5@GSpillmanNC @hornets @NBAOfficial they need to be flooded with this BS!!@Yas10k @buzz_szn @broojangles @nbafan2000_ @hornets Imma wait then, good luck. #allflyAs much as the calls down the stretch hurt Charlotte, so does the offense stalling in the middle quarters for the Hornets. Can't score in the teens in the second and third and get doubled up 30-15 in the second quarter. Just can't have that happen.@hornets Embarrassing@GSpillmanNC @hornets @NBAOfficial Where’s your still of the phantom 3 pointer@GianCarloPadua1 @buzz_szn @broojangles @nbafan2000_ @hornets just wait until after the deadline you’re so lucky we have this scrub plumlee at center@WATmovies_Matt @hornets @OfficialNBARefs Isn’t there a rule, though, that any interference from a bench player touching an opposing on-court player while shooting results in automatic points, live or dead? Regardless, Cavs won and refs failed to call a foul on Okoro for hugging Hayward and bringing him to the ground.Me and @CHARLOTTEMAN3 will be back tomorrow @hornets .  Rowdy Saturday barn@jimmy6m @BaileyCundiff @hornets 2 seconds after a whistle was blown calling the play dead. So you guys got 4 free points.

I guess you can say ball don't lie.@SportsDespair Considering that they counted a Charlotte 3 point attempt 2 seconds after the whistles (and a couple other questionable calls the last few minutes), Hornets’ fans should not be bringing up the refs.

Fire them.❌ - I’ll try to do better with calling braindead coaches benching their franchise players for entire quarters while they’re down in close games. Much deserved loss @hornets https://t.co/Lr3tG0NkIUFeeling the life deflate out of the Charlotte Hornet’s arena when the Cavs won was all the happiness I need for the next few months@buzz_szn @hornets Shuutttt the fuck up@DavisCox70 @CHA_ttuuse @im_ricky_216 @hornets @BartherBuzz Refs love us? Your shit squad was GIFTED 4 points and still LOST! Without Darius Garland we still wiped your ass pal. #Charlottesucks #CAVS@hornets Sad to say LaMelo is the only thing going well for this franchise. Not even Mikal Jordan can save you #CantFly@LehoustonFan @HonestTrumpster @hornets There was no worse call then giving a team 4 free points on a dead play that was ruled out of bounds already lol. That propelled the Hornets back into the game lol. They were down 10.The refs gave Charlotte 3 points due to a Cavs' player on the bench touching a Hornets' player shooting a 3 after the whistle. I say pass interference in the end zone should be 6 points!  
#spotfoul@Tony_Pesta Hornets announcers were crying about the game being stolen? THAT'S RICH! I'm sure they conveniently left out the fact Charlotte was awarded three free points earlier in the quarter.@marlonplayzalot @hornets Yeah right lol that tech was fucking bs and the game shouldn't had even come down to that@buzz_szn @hornets oh yeah they gave y’all a free three points because rozier hit a three LIGHTYEARS after the whistle@buzz_szn @NotAdamBentley3 @GarlandBurner @hornets After the whistle your announcers have to be the most uneducated people on this planet, I lost brain cellsCharlotte Hornets James Borrego is the worst coach in the nba.. doesn’t trust Lamelo Ball 😑@NBA that call at the end of the @hornets vs @cavs was absolute bullshit.

That 4 point play in the @cavs @hornets game was absolute garbage and then you follow it up with a review of possible flagrant when it was clear it was common. Crazy 🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️@hornets you and your fans are pathetic as fuck😂😂This @cavs game is wild; @hornets were literally just given 3 points from the referees. 😬🙃😎🤔✌️Down 5. Come on @hornets we need the W tonight!!The Charlotte Hornets are fun to watchwhy is ball not in rn?!?! @hornetsI love watching this @hornets team@hornets @cody_martin15 Borrego is such an amazing coach and that special system he’s been talking about is working, we are blowing out the cavs. Also our franchise player and seasoned vet is back and he’s cooking and he carried the team. I’m so happy for the Hornets organization y’all are so smart 😂if you are the lady behind the @hornets scores table telling JB to chill i hope your husband next to you hands you divorce papers immediately after the game@NBA 

Seriously, @cavs @hornets  

This is refereeing?????@hornets always have Lamelo on the bench when i decide to watch them. Why is ur franchise player not playing in crunch time?🤔 https://t.co/iNYBvhJQBTThe refs in this game are definitely horrible and should be fired. Refs betting on games and @cavs vs @hornets have a few reffing now. Wow!!!Seriously, good for Goodwin, fuck these refs and these idiots in Charlotte. Pull this out.

The Cavs should have been up 10, Hornets ball with 4 min to go, instead the refs just gave 4 points to CHA for no reason LMAO@JamesAndo24 @hornets Doesnt even have Hayward in either lol@nba the three moronic officials working the @cavs @hornets game need to be suspended for giving the @hornets 3 points on a shot that occurred after the ball had been whistled as out of bounds.@NBAOfficial are you serious right now in this @cavs - @hornets game????? Refs counted a 3 point basket 3 seconds after the whistle was blown and called a technical! TERRIBLE@hornets this gotta be that weirdo coaches last game.@hornets @MELOD1P Garbage ass team. Can’t even beat the cavs? The CAVS? embarrassing organization. I’d take lamelos side chick over him any day of the week on the courtThe refs in the @hornets game have no clue what they’re doing lol but ill take the free pointsThe Hive is absolutely nuts right now! @Hornets fans are well aware of what’s on the lineUmmm….@NBA….you guys need to explain this phantom 4 point play @cavs @hornets game….worst call ever.@hornets fire y’all fuckin coach he playing pj Washington over LaMelo in crunch timeThat was the most ridiculous call I have ever seen @cavs @hornets  Tough to beat anyone when #NBA #refs give your opponent 3 points during dead ballCharlotte Hornets have the refs on the team too?Charlotte Hornets make everything even the routine plays hard. Everything (offense/defense) has a high degree of difficulty.@cmeyer52 @NBA @cavs @hornets AgreedGarland (on the bench) jokingly seats at a 3 by the Hornets after the whistle was blown. So they gave Charlotte 3 points even tho it wasn’t an official shot? Plus a technical??? Huhhhhh? #LetEmKnowSomeone explain to me how there could be bench interference when the play was dead! These refs are ridiculous! You're in Charlotte no the damn garden what are you getting favouring the bumb ass hornets?@NBAOfficial What Just Occurred In @Cavs @Hornets Was Unconscionable... https://t.co/9wi5WsnKSnJust saw the worst call in @NBA history during @cavs vs @hornetsHoly...

I sincerely hope the NBA reviews the play that just happened and disciplines the refs.

How do you count the bucket when the shot comes WAY after the whistle blows?

Makes absolutely NO sense. @cavs @hornets @NBAI'm confused how was @hornets was just awarded 3 points and he missed the shot 🤔What just happened in Charlotte? That technical foul and 3-pointer was dumb. #Cavs #Hornetsobviously I need @Hornets to win this game!!@hornets @MELOD1P WAIT HOW TF DID THE HORNETS GET 3 POINTS???@NBA get involved in this @cavs @hornets game.  A 3 was awarded the hornets after the ball was whistled out of bounds.  Complete nonsense.How in the hell @hornets just got 3 points plus a F/TThe refs just had an insane blunder in the Cavs/Hornets game and then Td up Bickerstaff after. 4 point play for Charlotte when it shoulda been ball side out of bounds.

At some point these clowns have to be held accountable.4th QTR drama LETS GET THIS @hornets #AllFlyHey @NBA you guys just giving free points to players during a dead ball now!?

@cavs 
@hornetsThese refs are a fucking joke @NBAOfficial @hornetsbuzz buzz i love watching the charlotte hornets shoot hoops :’)The worst officiating mistake I can imagine in an NBA game just happened in the @hornets gameHey @NBAOfficial @NBA , just curious. Do the Hornets 🐝 have to use a weapon in the land in order to have a foul called against them?? Tonight’s crew in Charlotte has been terrible. 👓 #LetEmKnowWhere was this 3 point shooting? Y’all save it for the 4th? 😂 @hornets@hornets @MELOD1P Trash teamCharlotte hornets are trash!! 😩@ponsaaanw @hornets @MELOD1P facts....the family all about Money...probably getting paid to lose.

We need him to spread the floor. He’s been cold, now he’s timid to shoot. He has to shoot his way out of this slump. Quit turning down shots because he’s cold.@hornets @AthleticBrewing We need a CONSISTENT three point shooter not just streaky ones@hornets @AthleticBrewing Lock Allen in the changerooms@KyleBaileyClub @hornets I’m not a Borrego hater. But I think it’s valid to question not rotating smith or Bouknight in when your other guards aren’t getting anything going. And I don’t understand not getting Richard’s some time to at least body Jarret@hornets @AthleticBrewing Y'all fighting??? Trade that bum ass Center dude give Allen 24 and 20 in just 24 mins.@hornets @AthleticBrewing The flight ended at half time FYM Garbage center garbage team@hornets @AthleticBrewing Stop losing@hornets @AthleticBrewing Trade for Turner please@hornets Cmon Brahhhh@hornets @AthleticBrewing Game plan: let Kevin love shoot while wide open every possession.

4th quarter and Charlotte needs to heat up, trailing by 11.@KyleBaileyClub @hornets Yup exactly. We’re dangerous if we’re running and dunking and our shots are falling. But that’s a lot of ifs to try to make up for giving up the paintCAN WE TRADE EVERYONE EXCEPT MELO, MILES AND THE ROOKS ???
THANK YOU @hornets.
#AllFly@hornets please get rid of @gordonhayward . Please. #allfly@hornets bro is y’all cool? DamnHayward is obviously rusty and not playing well in his first game back from injury.. Yet Borrego gives him big minutes &amp; continues to limit LaMelo's minutes.. #MakesNoSense

@T_Rozzay3 had 10 in the 1st quarter, 13 in the half.

@MELOD1P 11 points.

If the @hornets can speed things up and get more fast break opportunities I like their chances in the 2nd half.@ImLiteralLarry1 @hornets Thank you for telling us Larry happy Friday@ZipTy4 @hornets Never pisses me offthis Charlotte Hornets - Cleveland Cavaliers game got me thinking, how can the NBA arrange a 3-team battle royale with the Memphis Grizzlies for 2022 League Pass Team of the Year honors?? 🤔@Jrusko29 @camutdforever @phpwastooshort @hornets We need defense broHornets vs Cavs! #AllFly @hornets https://t.co/KJIpTKvUX2@nickstitt_ @hornets Relax buddy@hornets be better@Reecespuffs1738 @hornets Hayward just had COVID. Calm down. 🤦🏻‍♂️@Nick_Denton @hornets @wilson_norfleet Not at the moment but I appreciate the offer@hornets Borrego the Phil Jackson of Charlotte with the proven system that has won chips upon chips has this under control but if he can’t put franchise Hayward will score 60 in the second half so I’m not afraid. Hornet fans(me not included )are pathetic and love mediocrity@hornets Friend you’re literally supposed to keep the lead!@hornets Hornets struggle against a team missing 4 starters.....  sounds about right!!!@camutdforever @phpwastooshort @hornets No reason to trade pj or James for a average center@mane8610 @hornets Think there was 10 missed shots in a row at one point@hornets Make a move Mitch this is embarrassing@hornets Tryna be a somebody no one @ me unless it is a reasonable response because this is just me ranting@hornets You guys are 🗑@hornets Need to show some pride and not get cooked by their fourth string point guard@hornets Way to many FG and 3 Pointer attempts. Hayward, Oubre always losing the ball in sich embarrassing manners lmao I love these guys but come on.@hornets Nah lemme rant real quick what the fuck are we doing I have never been more disappointed in a team I support than today Hayward can barely hit a shot nevertheless everyone else doesn’t pass to an open man would rather run into the traffic everyone missing shots plumlee a nobody..Going to the @hornets game tomorrow. I hope they enforce the mask mandate!!!!!!@hornets Coach Borrego’s winning system is working I guess. And our savior Gordon Hayward is back we should be leading but I guess it’s a good plan in the GREAT system of superstar JB and his favorite GH 👏 our franchise player 😂@UNC_Humor Well if he’s in Charlotte and you call him he would probably leave willing because the hornets just fell apart@phpwastooshort @hornets We don't need a trade.@hornets Slowly but surely wasting ANOTHER season. Borrego and Kupchak turning me off from basketball completely.Time for a second half run! 

#AllFly | @hornets https://t.co/jTRaLkH9YeCleveland really just has the green light to take shots knowing they got someone down there bound to get a rebound… smh #hornets @hornets@hornets Bench Hayward,he is trash use PJW.@Hornets Borrego can really make some questionable decisions sometimes. Why would anyone take a player e him on the out of the game who’d scored twice as many points as anyone else in the game and leave him on the bench practically all of the 2nd qt. Rozier was killing em. Damn@hornets if changes aren’t made at the off-season kup has to go. this defense is pitiful@hornets Got the blowing a lead part out of the way early now please get the lead again in the second halfThe Charlotte Hornets are the hottest ticket in town and more fans are flocking to the Spectrum Center this season to see LaMelo Ball, Miles Bridges and company play! 👑 https://t.co/6c7NDeCsuAi went the the hornets cavs game in charlotte last year and this is basically the same game@hornets guard the 3@hornets You have 6 days to make a trade Mitch@hornets That honestly was probably the most embarrassing quarter I’ve ever watched in the NBA. Borrego better rip this group to shreds at half and wake these guys up. Figure it out boys let’s go.Let's reset. 

#AllFly https://t.co/g4xqgElIAj@hornets @MELOD1P @HornetsOnBally Defense is non existent with this teamCavs lead Hornets 52-46

Rozier: 13 pts
Ball: 11 pts, 5 reb, 3 ast

Cleveland did a good job slowing down the pace of the game. Charlotte needs to amp the speed of this game back up in the 2nd half.25-6 run in the 2nd quarter. Unbelievable 😐 @hornets Our defense fucking sucks@KingFuseLit 

CHARLOTTE HORNETS VS CLEVELAND CAVALIERS LAMELOS REVENGE WATCH LIVE https://t.co/aNO7SIbzNL via @YouTubeI can’t believe my eyes. Charlotte Hornets?? Wtf was that@hornets @MELOD1P @HornetsOnBally HOW ARE YOU LOSING?!?!?@hornets @MELOD1P @HornetsOnBally This team is horrible. Mitch needs to get his head out of his ass and JB needs to get his shit out of Charlotte.There’s a damn hornet stuck in my lamp. Welcome back Charlotte. Some one come burn my damn house down.@Hornets allergic to 7 footers and shooters.  We just need some Benedryl tonight. We'll be ok. #AllFlyFuck the @hornetsI have not watched a Charlotte Hornets game in a long time when did they hire Kendall Roy to coach?@NickWilsonSays @hornets @wilson_norfleet Does phd let you drink? Happy to buy you a beer@NBA @hornets @cavs Melo did something!!! 😱@hornets @MELOD1P @HornetsOnBally With the Hornets style of play and LaMelo’s game…..Why did we get Plumlee??? He doesn’t fit, serviceable center but he doesn’t fit the Hornets style #AllFly #BuzzCity We need an athletic spread the floor big@hornets Allen is making Plumlee look very weak. I just saw that Wade dude pushing Plumlee around. WEAK@hornets Plumlee has no impact on this game at all. Allen is making you look weak. You’re not aggressive at all. I mean I just saw this wade dude push you around. WEAK@ESPNNBA I’m glad @TheRealLJ2 isn’t all forgotten in Charlotte! Imho, he’s the greatest Hornet in franchise history and his #2 should have been retired a long time ago! 💪🏿@hornets @MELOD1P @HornetsOnBally The ref this game 😭@hornets @MELOD1P @HornetsOnBally we’re pathetic lmaoThere’s a goodie going on in “Uptown Charlotte”-

#AllFly | @HornetsOnBally https://t.co/BkBJ3Rt9pE@hornets @HornetsPR @HornetsOnBally Why would  Borrego take Terry Rozier out of the game when he was scoring the ball &amp; kept him out more than half of the 2nd qt. Hornets were 10 points up when he was benched. How did that make any sense?Get Hayward out of the game.. 

#Hornets @HornetsCharlotte Hornets vs Cleveland Cavaliers game thread https://t.co/mYj7lQjJOI via @At_The_Hivegordon hayward is washed.  get him off the floor @hornets@hornets just can't stop shooting 3s.@hornets Please stop going for the 3‘s permanently. That’s the reason why they fall behind. Especially Oubre needs to calm down on his attempts ffsIt’s like every time I start watching a @hornets game, we start not making any shots.7-0 Cavs run, Hornets' lead down to 3 (Q2 6:20)

Charlotte is 4/16 from 3P (25%) - lots of good looks, just not connecting@hornets  Bruh Cody Martin annoying as hellHORNETS GAME!! @hornets #AllFly https://t.co/znITlQ7eEd@Nick_Denton @hornets @wilson_norfleet Section 108 in the media areaCharlotte hornets  Cavs What the f is y’all playing?😳😳😳😳I need points@hornets #hornetsnite gladiator by Jaycee Wolf for my man Cam!@hornets Tell Hayward to pass lamelo was wide open but he decides to run into their defense@NBATV @cavs @hornets Why is a national game blocked in my area?Miles Bridges quite literally PUNCHES it home  (🎥: @hornets)
https://t.co/RyXaEWd08T@NickWilsonSays heard you were at the @hornets game on @wilson_norfleet, where are you sitting?Well isn't this some shit. I live in Charlotte, have a hard enough time trying to watch Browns games without spending an arm and a leg. So I was really looking forward to being able to watch the Cavs play the Hornets since they're in CLT tonight! Annnd it's blacked out here. Wtf.@hornets Man wsup wit this pic 💀@Reecespuffs1738 @hornets @masonplumlee yeah i know that, thats why he ll be gone by Thursday@hornets center please 🙏@hornets this graphic is awful wow@NBA @hornets @cavs You still use him for clicks lmao, have some shame@SamFarberLive @T_Rozzay3 @hornets When is the hornets announce going to call national TV games he’s the best in the world right now.@hornets why this old pic lolCheck out Charlotte Hornets New Era Snapback Hat Cap #NewEra #CharlotteHornets https://t.co/xj0T4nLlrO via @eBay@Pajita06 @hornets @masonplumlee We don’t need another offensive player though we need a solid defenderStarting off the right way! 

#AllFly https://t.co/qnI4zJm6Jy31-22 Hornets lead after Q1; hot start for Rozier (10 PTS on 4/5, 2 AST) against his hometown team

Charlotte shooting 55%; Jarrett Allen 13 PTS and 9 REB, rest of Cavs are shooting 3/15 (20%)@hornets @masonplumlee Easy money@hornets leading after 1. Foul concerns with Ball, Bridges &amp; Plumlee with 2 each. Refs are calling everything.@hornets @masonplumlee Hes been better lately, besides his trash defense of course@hornets @masonplumlee We don’t care trade him now10 point 1st quarter for @T_Rozzay3 helps pace the @hornets to a 31-22 lead through 12 minutes.

#AllFly@hornets If JB don’t learn play his bigs 6-10 players it will be impossible to make it to the playoffs.Take off Plumlee! 💥 

@Masonplumlee | #AllFly https://t.co/42Da5ObtzdI sure hope @hornets can work out a trade for Hayward,for somekinda 
Solid bigman before allstar break #AllFly I been sayin Bridges needed that wing spot📝@CoachKarl22 @hornets Which player would you select?Checking in on the @cavs and @hornets https://t.co/5tMK2X1Ykycharlotte hornets commentators are a national treasure@hornets I’m waiting on ya to call up Gelo ballThe Cavs only guards tonight at Charlotte are Rondo and Goodwin?!? 😂😂😂 hornets should destroy them with small ball.#MIAvsCHA

https://t.co/JV52EM1eX3What was Jarrett Allen Money Line odds @ Charlotte Hornets today?@Ask_Spectrum Funny how I was watching the Charlotte Hornets basketball game and saw Spectrum displayed on the floor because they play at Spectrum center. That cost you $5 million a year for that. I guess you have that money when you overcharge customers@hornets @MELOD1P @HornetsOnBally He has to stop arguing with the refs and just play ball. Hurting the team not getting back on defense while going at the refs.@_bigjayy_ Jarret Allen has a double/double…IN THE FIRST QUARTER #LetEmKnow  @cavs @hornets@hornets should of went after Jared Allen@NBA @hornets @cavs I want the Hornets to make the playoffs this YEAR@hornets @MELOD1P @MilesBridges @HornetsOnBally I wanna see lamelo at allstarsWe see you @masonplumlee!

I got Lamelo Ball being the Greatest Basketball player to ever lace em up.

From his IQ to his shooting touch &amp; passing ability. Defense can get better but rn he is leading the 
Charlotte Hornets of all teams to 5th highest scoring offense in NBA 🔥@NBA @hornets @cavs And that’s why he supposed to be an All Star, imo@NBA @hornets @cavs No skill, all luck@NBA @hornets @cavs Not tough enough to be an all star 🤣🤣@NBA @hornets @cavs Fire🔥Jarret Allen should be a Charlotte Hornet@NBA @hornets @cavs Should have been an all star@NBA @hornets @cavs the big nets trio is breaking up, please don't …🥺Cleveland Cavaliers at Charlotte Hornets gamethread https://t.co/rT0OoOinJT https://t.co/xGWdHFeHqF@hornets @MELOD1P @HornetsOnBally all starCan the @hornets go ahead and trade Plumlee for Allen at the half?That's tough, LaMelo!
