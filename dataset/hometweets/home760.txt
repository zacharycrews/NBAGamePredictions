Much like the Raptors in Toronto. And can actually win a playoff round and title unlike the pathetic leafs.@Happyworlds17 @JustEsBaraheni Yup thats another one I was thinking of. Its not Raptors media but like Toronto media and I feel like a lot of it has to do with the Leafs/Jays being pushed a lot more.

I forgot we will play them again on Friday so no seven game winning streak for the HawksToday's NBA Consensus (So Far):

Golden State Warriors 71%
Detroit Pistons 66%
Toronto Raptors 63%
Washington Wizards 59%
Chicago Bulls 57%
Denver Nuggets 55%
Brooklyn Nets 51%@JustEsBaraheni I think it shouldnt be generalized as Raptors media but like Toronto media in general. Sid Seixro has it out for Pascal for some reason like I’m pretty sure his last tweet about him is that he was a -26 in a game, completely ignoring everything he’s done since then.If Lowry played today, he would play the raptors for the first time in a heat jersey, in Toronto (with 0 fans) and it would also be his 1,000th career game!Trade Deadline Deals:

Listen live 📻 https://t.co/VXgyFfR24Z@_nopename Who cares about Gary Trent Jr's ceiling!!! I like his floor as a 23 year old. 30 plus points 4 games in a row, lock down defence and 3 points marksman. I will take it. If he never gets better than this. I could care less. #wethenorth @raptors@Azur_Aruz Ajax, 6’4, born in 2004, I like basketball and animanga, my favourite series are slam dunk and Naruto, I also like boondocks. My favourite basketball team is Toronto raptors and my favourite player is pascal siakam and Fred vanvleet@ybfrm6 @Raptors I love Scotties goofy fun loving nature. He will level up though when he realizes…”l’m Scottie Barnes, give me the f’n ball now!”@NBA @Raptors At least the raps got one mention tonight@Raptors go Raptors@Raptors more like QT, am I right!? 😏@ItsKitaaxo @Raptors That was an awesome game https://t.co/4468SgeBhd@d_sauve32 @WayToo6ixy @Raptors @gtrentjr Also sure is a lot of goalpost shifting. The argument in the early part of the season was guys weren't healthy or in Health and Safety Protocols which was true.

Now the narrative is the bench sucks when everybody (minus Birch) is pretty much at 100%We ended the streak okayyyyyyyy  @Raptors 👏🏾#NBA New Orleans Pelicans 90 - 93 Cleveland Cavaliers, Los Angeles Clippers 116 - 122 Indiana Pacers, Memphis Grizzlies 119 - 122 Philadelphia 76ers (OT), Miami Heat 92 - 122 Boston Celtics, Sacramento Kings 96 - 116 New York Knicks, Toronto Raptors 106 -
https://t.co/IaToK9BcXZ@ybfrm6 @Raptors Agreed. Although IMO he played very well tonight despite not having big box score numbers. I like his unselfishness.@WayToo6ixy @Raptors @gtrentjr Ah, fair enough@d_sauve32 @WayToo6ixy @Raptors @gtrentjr You just said it. They got a better bench to fall back on. I'd go as far to say they're basically complete. Just a matter of how they fare out in the playoffs.

Seems like ppl want their cake and to eat it too. It's a development year yet a haste to make the playoffs@CBCMurdoch @CBC @cbcgem @Raptors @yannick_bisson #NickNurse @CBCMurdoch really enjoyed tonight’s show.

How can Freddy get practically close lined and end up flat on his back and there be no contact!! The Refereeing is a joke@McStoryGal @Raptors You tell me why they're trailing, I'm all ears

Lemme guess, the refs because being a "real fan" means you have to act oppressed and that the league has a conspiracy against Toronto
