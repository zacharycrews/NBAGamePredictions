As it turns out, a lot more than you think! https://t.co/2K0AUd1xlzI love the type of guy that posts in-depth, well researched, article length breakdowns of how the Charlotte Hornets are doing every single game for like three upvotes in the post-game thread.A high-scoring, well-balanced offense puts the Charlotte Hornets in the same category as the 1950s Boston Celtics. No, really!

The Bucks are on the back end of a B2B, had to travel from Brooklyn-Charlotte overnight, and they have multiple players trapped in H&amp;S protocols. Their guard depth is razor thin tonight.

Expect the Hornets to take advantage. https://t.co/KFMlc2UJ6I@SamFarberLive @ashahahmadi @HornetsOnBally @hornets Got any free tickets, Sam? 🙏🙏🙏happy gameday @hornets !🏀 Milwaukee Bucks (@Bucks) #FearTheDeer

Of course we are going to start Hayward. Your logic makes no sense at all. Bench the highest paid person on the Hornets for somebody still on their rookie contract. What’s the Hornets starting 5?

LaMelo Ball’s PUMA MB.01 “Buzz City” is unveiled. A nod to his Charlotte Hornets uniforms. https://t.co/lUWFxnfFvl@Darren16C @AdamKoffler @RexChapman Stanfield was 11th, but tied in points with 10 and 9, so arguably tied for 9th, but yeah. Still, nicely done. But the Charlotte Hornets? I missed them. I feel closer to the Cleveland Barons.I’m a big @hornets fan already and we are lucky enough to have the best announcer in the NBA (Eric Collins) it’s not just his hype game that is strong, the 2 minute chat about Trey Lyles being the best to come out of Saskatoon followed by directions to Moose Jaw is all time comms@hornets @greensboroswarm Can we get @LiAngeloBall upgraded. He better than most folks on Hornets bench. No disrespect just honestyMilwaukee Bucks (25-15, third in the Eastern Conference) vs. Charlotte Hornets (20-19, eighth in the Eastern Conference) https://t.co/Hb5gPbUqlf@Darren16C @AdamKoffler @RexChapman D, I'm so old the Charlotte Hornets mean precisely zero to me. But as you know, I can name all 7 Boston Bruins who were among the top-10 leading scorers in the NHL in 1970-71. I'll offer Pie McKenzie, Fred Stanfield and Wayne Cashman and then just walk the hell away. The rest...?Congratulations to Javsworld and legitimate_bop who moved up to take #3 and #23 on the Charlotte Hornets team leaderboard.

https://t.co/dYEEwV7pFm@hornets @MELOD1P You know what time it is @miksyy13As a @hornets fan, I love seeing @AhmadMonk tear it up in LA.

But any Lakers fans trying to tell us how much better Monk is in LA just prove to us you don't follow any basketball outside your own team. #WeKnew@SamFarberLive @greensboroswarm @hornets @Scottie23L @Jalen_NoRose1 Scottie is gonna player year 2.

The team was around before last year. Charlotte just had a multi time All Star PG in Kemba Walker. I will never discourage someone from supporting the Hornets. Doesn’t mean they can’t be idiots.@balldontstop @hornets This court uglyI wish our organization let our young guys get loose. @hornetsI love Malik Monk, one teams “trash” is another teams treasure @hornets #LakeShow@hornets thank you for Malik Monk@HonorThyKing @hornets @MELOD1P And Miles Bridges putting fear in the eyes of anyone in the paint, but yeah, no talent evaluation. Same club that let go of KCP, Kuzma, and Caruso to have the exact same record as Charlotte… if Lebron was in the East he’d be in contention for the play-in.@barstoolsports @stoolpresidente Bucks are @Hornets tomorrow and @Hornets on Monday.. just in case you were in NOLA  buying tickets 🤣🤣🤣@hornets @MELOD1P Retweet people.

#NBA2K22@JESnowden I can't find a picture of my Steelers starter either.

Yeah
I remember
Ick!@hornets @MELOD1P Let Kidd and Lebron tell it the Hornets don’t know how to draft or evaluate talent…. “Misused Malik Monk”. Yeah ok “legend” we don’t need ANY of your praise https://t.co/RHEQougcFc@uandme4life Charlotte #Hornets lately has been losing more games than win games and they’re still 20 - 19. Which is better than the Atlanta #Hawks 17 - 20. LaMelo Ball and the Charlotte has been between first and sixth seed all season so far.
