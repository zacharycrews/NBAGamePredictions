Golden State is 7-0 at home this postseason.

Dallas shot 36% in Game 1, their lowest thus far in the playoffs.

I hope many of you join me. Honestly.@warriors I hope he comes back even better! 💙🏀💛@bruslishop @warriors thanks 
i like this@NBA @warriors Love how Looney is a low key star in a couple of these clips. Dude is underrated all around.Steph Curry’s perimeter shooting is world-renowned, but his defense has quietly helped lead the Warriors to the Western Conference Finals. 🔒

Go @warriors@DogSurfRoadshow @warriors There’s a comparison to be made about how teams handle Steph and how teams handled Bonds in 2001, when he was walked 177 times in 153 games. Offense is so overpowering that they try to eliminate it by any means. Sadly in both cases it takes away from our enjoyment of the game.Complete Player Stats for the Dallas Mavericks / Golden State Warriors Playoff Series.

"If they make enough shots in four out of seven games, they’re going to win this series because the way the Golden State Warriors play defense – they can't play Luka like that. You can't play that dude one-on-one… if the Mavs make some shots, they win".@warriors Yes sirrr https://t.co/WZMw6cl574@CLGThe100mphMan @warriors I can see where you would say that, I could also say the day that Mark Jackson was let go was the change.

Perhaps he doesn’t have help because teams let Luka go and shut down all his options defensively.🏀 @StephenCurry30 led the @warriors to a Game 1 blowout of @dallasmavs in the #NBA West playoff finals yesterday.

Dallas Mavericks Vs. Golden State Warriors Friday, May 20, 2022.

Read More: https://t.co/QlnsQMnVyC https://t.co/F2VlCseXfyI dunno what is going to happen for the rest of the playoffs, but the @warriors off ball defensive rotations in game 1 against Dallas were better than I’ve seen from them in years. If they can maintain that level of D for 13 games they can beat anyone.@NBA @warriors @dallasmavs Mavs should hire a better photographer,lighting is ass in luka’s photo@flowverse_ @nbatopshot @flow_blockchain @TheRealJoff @WARRIORS

We know Luka has help. Mavs came off emotional game 7 and didn’t have the rest and opportunity to plan for the game like the Dubs. I expect the Mavs to play a lot better. This is a must win game for @warriors. Dallas is a solid team.🏀NBA Western Conference Finals Game 2

Thank you Joe Lacob! Go #DubNation@warriors amazing one@warriors LETS GET THIS W!@TheAthleticNBA @tim_cato Golden State Warriors defensive scheme, "High hedge &amp; recover" helped Andrew Wiggins look like the Luka Doncic-stopper. 😄😄😄 Teammate jump out high as a help-defender guarding Doncic until Wiggins can recover to guarding Doncic.Ok, I said Kerr’s out of timeout plays need to be studied. Well, looky here at dis video, every single play was a backdoor rub(illegal) screen(usually Curry with feet not set).

Force some turnovers from them and have active hands. With golden state's unique offense, they need to communicate perfectly. If they can do all that (which I think will be the case tonight) they win! I got mavs winning tonight's game.Stephen Curry long had to live with his mother’s gentle jabs that his siblings earned their degrees, and the Golden State Warriors star had not.
