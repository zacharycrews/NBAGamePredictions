Will watch again when they're healthy and a trade is made.Bismack Biyombo @bismackbiyombo will start Wed vs  Utah!

Rudy Gobert (calf) is sitting out Wed for the @utahjazz , so it's a solid matchup for Biyombo on the road.

https://t.co/mQcV8cREgdOnly 2 teams in NBA history have ever come back from a 30+ point deficit twice.

Utah Jazz: 1996 vs Denver and 1998 vs Chicago
Los Angeles Clippers: 2019 vs Golden State and 2022 vs Washington

Both Clippers wins were on the road, and their win vs GSW was in the playoffs.@leaguefits @JordanClarksons @utahjazz Stasty@ChaseHughesNBCS "The greatest comeback in National Basketball Association play occurred on November 27, 1996, when the Utah Jazz, down by 36 points to the Denver Nuggets late in the second quarter (it was 70–36 at the half and 70-34 just before), overcame this deficit to win 107–103."  GoogleUtah Jazz fans get used to rigid rotations and generally good health, so when deep bench guys get burn we tend to go "ooo, new shiny object!" a bit much 

That said, I swear that Danuel House is a guy that makes sense and should play regularly.
