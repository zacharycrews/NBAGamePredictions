There was optimism he could return yesterday, but back spasms are tricky.

Sometimes the players back feels fine, while other times it flares up. In LaVine's case, it flared up.I’ve been seeing a lot of success in player performance doubles and I really like this one I drafted up at +1700. I would be surprised for this not to hit even though I hate betting against my Chicago bulls 😪

More info: https://t.co/e3PM6GsOsn https://t.co/GsvSu9Q098The Chicago Bulls have often been injured this season, but how do they stack up vs other teams?

Below, find total games missed by player for each #NBA team, as well as how many games each Chicago Bulls player has missed for the 2021-22 season.

Data: https://t.co/J4lm3v0XRD https://t.co/dqgTsQABDfNBA tweeples? 
I'm a Chicago Bulls fan and I don't know much about Brooklyn Nets players contracts. But my 2 cents: why trade Beard J. Harden when Anti-vax K. Irving doesn't play all scheduled games? Isn't trading Irving for Simmons who also hasn't played makes more logical? ????Joel Embiid reached the 40-point mark for the seventh time this season as he helped the Philadelphia 76ers beat the Chicago Bulls 119-108 in the NBA last night.

In other results:

Nuggets 124-104 Nets

This game at the very least showed everyone that when healthy, the Bulls can wipe the sixers. Sixers are a good team, but only when Embiid is on the floor.Time to Sell? Elevate your Jordan results!

Idk if bulls get so lucky with the opposing team injuries like the suns did tho@DarkBryson @chicagobulls Matt Thomas led the league in 3-point field goal percentage last year. He was brought here as a situational player, he was not brought here to play 30 minutes a game. But since the Bulls are missing 6 players, Thomas has to play a different role. He’s fine. He’s not being traded.@ChiSportUpdates @chicagobulls What has Patrick Williams done to be called a young star?"[Charania] The Washington Wizards are sending Otto Porter to the Chicago Bulls for Bobby …"

You trade Coby for a decent big man and then you trade for Schroder to replace Coby’s scoring off the bench. What’s the problem with that?@ASTATE903320101 @chicagobulls @DeMar_DeRozan So you have a problem with trading TBJ and Thomas for Schroder? TBJ is straight up ass and needs to go. Thomas played 34 minutes which is a problem and whenever he doesn’t make threes he’s completely useless. So again how is trading TBJ and Thomas for Schroder a bad trade?@chicagobulls @DeMar_DeRozan Lethal☠️No better feeling than taking Vegas' money everyday.
