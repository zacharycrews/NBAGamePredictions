LET’S GOOOO!!!!!!!!!!your boston celtics are a half game out of first place in the east and it’s officially time for me to get worried sick about the postseasonI think @raptors can make the playoffs this season! This young group of fellows are a real team! Just a great group!!Always have to watch @celtics though!! @raptors #WeTheNorthBoston Celtics since 2022 (38 games):

Record: 29-9 (2nd in the league behind Suns)

PPG: 112.7 (11th)
RPG: 46.1 (4th)
APG: 25.8 (9th)
FG%: 48% (4th)
3PT%: 36.9% (5th) 
FT%: 82.6 (2nd)
OFFRTG: 116.7 (6th)
DEFRTG: 104.1 (1st)If the C’s beat the Wolves and the Suns beat Philly tomorrow night OUR Boston Celtics will be in FIRST PLACE!?!  WhaaaaaaWhy yes that is your 3rd place Boston Celtics &amp; only a half game back. 27 games ago we were in 10th place. We were 1 game under .500. We're now 18 games above .500 .  What a wild season this has been. https://t.co/fkLW8zZXLeI think the Boston Celtics &amp; Phoenix Suns are the 2 best teams in the league right now. I just don't see a team in the East that beats Boston. Unless Ben Simmons comes back that's a rough matchup for Brooklyn. They need Simmons against Boston.With Miami and Milwaukee losing tonight, with a Sixers loss to Phoenix and a Celtics win over Minnesota tomorrow, the Boston Celtics would move into the number one seed in the Eastern Conference.

Good night.Ain’t no way this the Miami Heat squad that’s supposed to be coming out the East over my @celtics 🌚@jj_redick Isiah Thomas should have won the MVP and the Boston Celtics are cursed for not backing up the brinks truck for him.THE BOSTON CELTICS ARE A HALF GAME OUT OF FIRST PLACE. ☘️ 

#Celtics #bleedgreen #NBA #miamiheat #HEATCulture #Sixers #NBATwitter @celticsThe Boston Celtics are now a half game out of first https://t.co/hnM7yYEDwaWith losses by the Heat and Bucks tonight, the @celtics are just a half game out of the 1-seed in the East. A win and a Sixers loss to the Suns tomorrow would put the Celtics in a tie for the 1-seed. It’s going to be a hectic last couple weeks in the NBA. #NBA@Celtics_PRam @KeithSmithNBA @celtics Gotta think long term at the same time as thinking short term. We’ll be over the tax for years to come. Pushing it back one more year gives us at least a little more room to make a good signing this summer@TheCMoore_ @KeithSmithNBA @celtics Oh so it’s your money? Lots of assumptions there.

Few days ago I was just hoping @celtics would have home court advantage in 1st round but now have a great chance at the 1 seed which guarantees nothing but still nice to have!!!!@TheCMoore_ @KeithSmithNBA If the @celtics cheap owners had let Brad be a little more creative and used the Fournier TPE to acquire White I’m sure we could still have JRich and the Jays could both be well rested down the stretch. But those penny pinching SOB’s requires Stevens get under the tax line.The Boston Celtics were 19-21 earlier in the ‘21-‘22 season and on track to be a play-in team. 

They have gone 27-7 since.

With a win against Minnesota and a 76ers loss, they have a chance to be the #1 seed in the East tomorrow.
