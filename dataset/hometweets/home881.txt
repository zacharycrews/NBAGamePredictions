Ibaka as the priority defender with Giannis on the help-side would be most ideal preference when defending Embiid.@GratisOG @Bucks nah Nwora about to go 12-18@Bucks Nwora boutta go off@Bucks Bro?

Philly is one of those.. Destroy them@SnellSZN @Bucks Literally no reason to start Bobby over Serge in ANY game. Serge is much better defensively, fits around Giannis and lets Giannis focus more on offense. Bobby has more rounded offensive game and having him lead the bench lets him have more plays set up for him@NworaVibes @Bucks Watch giannis will have another historical game, last was 44 points last was 50 an will see this one.

Giannis never ever disappoints when it comes to the 76ers.

Giannis dislikes the 76ers/embiid an not harden onto the team now.

No team in the league outside of the Bucks and GSW has had  a higher growth trajectory imo.@The_Chi_Boy @AlexXio34491435 @JCB_Journo @Bucks The only argument in this statement is MJ’s time with the Bulls when they were a dynasty and chances are #1 you weren’t even born or remember the last finals the Bulls won and #2 it’s been 2 decades since the Bulls last title.

- Relationship with Mike Budenholzer and the rest of the Bucks' coaching staff was a major reason he came to Milwaukee.
- He talked with Giannis Antetokounmpo before signing with the Bucks.
- Bembry said he almost signed with the Bucks last season.@metromkewx @Bucks You might get almost kicked out tho, keeping you out of the merch store :)#NBA
