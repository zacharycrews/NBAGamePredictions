Miami Heat -6 (-140)

MIA is eighth in the league in defensive efficiency and they’ve been very dominant at home, where they held three of their last four opponents under 100 points, expect the Clippers to struggle offensively.

I’m tired of every game being the knicks, Lakers or warriors.  

How you drop a @JaMorant game?  He’s the highlight of the league!!  You drop the main man?  F%%k!@joelmsiegel Complete agreement. And to watch the Miami Heat play is to appreciate the value of Zen-like continuity. Find a great President and a good coach and a reliable philosophy and just ... do it@moseskagan @Austen This argument is illogical. Austin and Miami will eventually meet the same fate if it continues to grow at what SF grew to. It won't because racists, oppressive heat, disbelief in climate change, hatred towards women. But if it did, same result.@SFSkyforce @MiamiHEAT @chrisbosh @nbagleague @mchalmers15 Love this ❤Learned today that "Pepas" is becoming the Miami Heat's unofficial anthem. 

Colluding to create a Big 3 in 2010 is one thing.

Underrated.@andrwwang @MiamiHEAT Haha loved your Heat swag while you were down here in Miami. Having heat season tickets have always been on my bucket list. When I achieve that I’m inviting you to a game.THE MIAMI HEAT WILL WIN THE NBA FINALSJust placed Reggie Jackson Over 2.5 3s (-105)

In 22 games without Morris, Reggie has averaged 8.2 attempts, and 2.8 makes. 

The Miami Heat are middle of the pack giving up 35% from 3 to their opponents.

I can trust that Reggie will take a lot of shots, so I’ve got the over!@andrwwang @Pickillionaire @MiamiHEAT And Draymond is not even back yet sheeesh@FearNovaSix @MiamiHEAT Thanks.   Fyi.@Pickillionaire @MiamiHEAT the miami heat are my favorite team but admittedly the warriors are probably playing the best basketball of any team at the moment. heat are definitely up there and we'll be #1 by playoff time (after i onboard bam and jimmy) xD@andrwwang Don’t think I’ve seen the @MiamiHEAT with any nfts.@andrwwang Not sure how many @MiamiHEAT players have NFTs@rebellefleur89 I welcome more cross over.

Dumb in spending it.@Alf954 @InriJisasKrayst @MiamiHEAT @CanesHoops Martin, I tweeted they’re not the best team in the state.
