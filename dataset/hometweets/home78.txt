The only team producing fewer PPP is the Detroit Pistons, who have been without Cade Cunningham entirely and Jerami Grant for a game.No.1 overall draft pick, Cade Cunningham, is expected to make his NBA debut against Orlando Magic.

Injuries are definitely a concern though@dlorapaport @rocketsbeliever @CadeCunningham_ @DetroitPistons Zions had two major surgeries and plays with more force than anyone in the league. Cade has a minor ankle sprain. It‚Äôs a common injury if you play hoops. Miss 3/4 weeks and you‚Äôre good. Also Cade doesn‚Äôt rely on athleticism or a leaper. You‚Äôre projecting here. Not similar at all@IOntiveroz @DetroitPistons @FWJackson15 @Keith_Langlois We shot 35% last season which would rank 11th in the league so far this season.
