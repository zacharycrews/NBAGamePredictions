Or will they? https://t.co/afqZWhyKonThe Dallas Mavericks are producing 0.877 points per possession (PPP) through five games — ranking 29th. 

The only team producing fewer PPP is the Detroit Pistons, who have been without Cade Cunningham entirely and Jerami Grant for a game.No.1 overall draft pick, Cade Cunningham, is expected to make his NBA debut against Orlando Magic.

Guys a beast too. Top 5 league pass guy to watch if he’s playing@dlorapaport @rocketsbeliever @CadeCunningham_ @DetroitPistons That’s not really how most people covering basketball see it but you can say whatever you want. Hard to predict injuries although Zion had concerns from his size and the way he plays. He was one of my favorite players to watch last year.@dlorapaport @rocketsbeliever @CadeCunningham_ @DetroitPistons Calling Zion a bust too is moronic too. Bust means he’s no good. When Zions out there he’s an all star and potential all nba guy. Injuries are definitely a concern though@dlorapaport @rocketsbeliever @CadeCunningham_ @DetroitPistons Zions had two major surgeries and plays with more force than anyone in the league. Cade has a minor ankle sprain. It’s a common injury if you play hoops. Miss 3/4 weeks and you’re good. Also Cade doesn’t rely on athleticism or a leaper. You’re projecting here. Not similar at all@IOntiveroz @DetroitPistons @FWJackson15 @Keith_Langlois We shot 35% last season which would rank 11th in the league so far this season. Plus we added shooting in the offseason, so it stands to reason we should be improved. It's just a massive team wide cold streak rn. Let em fly.@dlorapaport @rocketsbeliever @CadeCunningham_ @DetroitPistons Enjoy the season man.Hope we got two stars. I don’t hope for busts. The league is better with great players.
