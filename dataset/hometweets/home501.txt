I hope he can stick somewhere.Houston Rockets already lost twice against the Lakers, garbage team like them would normally sell a game again vs another garbage team like the Lakers for money. If they got any pride, they can beat the Lakers, but when money talks, they’ll probably just punt this game away. 🤡"Westbrook Slow Starter"

Westbrook, in 2019-20 for the Houston Rockets, averaged 21.7 points and shot 39.9% through his first 19 games. He ended up averaging 27.2 points per game that year and shot 47.2% from the field. https://t.co/GF90F2l0N6Reminder for tonight:

Yes. Am I confident at all? No. Lakers are on a skid; however The Rockets are still below them for a reason. 2-0 against them on the year from what I’ve seen in the schedule and at the end of the day it’s LeBron vs Houston. Good luck@rangerrollins @Tom_Cody_SP @sunday_puncher I'm not necessarily agreeing with this one but your point is important.  The "same race comparisons" are often useless and biased if not racist.  The Houston Rockets got it  and required their scouts only compare players if of different races for that reason.@HoustonRockets @alperensengun “So good” doesn’t coverPlease bubble wrap @KingJames @Lakers @HoustonRockets so I can see the GOAT for the first time in person tonight.
