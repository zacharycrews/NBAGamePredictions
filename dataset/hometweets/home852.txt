Your assertion is that bc the team physician - who is paid by the team - should be the deciding professional and not his own doctors?@SportsCenter @BrooklynNets Mental Health issues cured? @NBA should be outraged that this was used as an excuse to leave a team.@BrooklynNets @AndreDrummond @sdotcurry I hope final conference game will be Nets vs sixers@Dale_Jennings @AnsahDenzel @MorrisChestbutt @BrooklynNets Well we had Simmons and frankly I‚Äôll disagree.

https://t.co/gxyoDIVXnX@erikslaterNR Rockets could've traded Eric Gordon to a few teams for a first. They're not buying him out. It's like saying the Nets might buy out Seth Curry.

Schroder won't be bought out unless he requests it, but if he says he wants to go to Brooklyn, he definitely won't get bought out.The Nets are 3.5 games back from the 6th seed and the East is heating up! 
Where do they finish? ü§î

I hope Ben Simmons falls flat on his ass in Brooklyn. If Harden doesn't sign 76ers will have $47 mil in cap space.  I just don't like bailing out Nets with all those assets.

NBA is the most non-white and Democratic; NFL and MLB are about equally non-white and more Republican. NHL slightly more. The Brooklyn Nets are the least white fan base (40%).
