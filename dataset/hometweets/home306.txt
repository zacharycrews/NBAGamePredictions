It is not a bad thing when used wisely. When you make a 3-pointer the opponent has to make 2 shots to pass you up with his 2-pointers and they better not miss. 😀😀😀 The pressure mounts.@_JasonLT @Jumpshot8 @Suns @chicagobulls I remember DaMar DeRozan being criticized about 5 years ago for concentrating so heavily on those Kobe Bryant mid-range shots instead of stepping outside for that extra point.

It is like saying covid represents all viruses. 

It is just a small part.@rashadburner the chicago bulls every other gameI thought I was announcing today that I am officially a Chicago Bulls fan@TruzzLamar @dam64703367 @NFL @SNFonNBC He has the typical IQ of a Baker fan. He thinks he’s every Ravens fan is in BMore and every Bulls fan is in Chicago 😂😂😂😂I love that he (?) goes from Browns hating to Dallas to Real Madrid to PSG to the Chicago Bulls!

And other nights can go 1-10 and score 2 points.In Chitown, the @Cubs &amp; @whitesox &amp; @ChicagoBears made a point of wishing their Jewish fans a Happy Hanukkah. The @NHLBlackhawks &amp; @chicagobulls didn't say anything (@chicagobulls even commented on the sad passing of @LouisVuitton's Virgil Abloh).

https://t.co/8jbBDKJXhXIt's cool. In the bullpen. It's not the Chicago Bulls situation... can you hear me? 

Me: Yes. Hello... Happy Holiday. It's honest to go back to the table. 

You understand, we asked you? 

Me: Yes, it was me outside. I'm Femur, Lips, Pretty Lips. Yes.I was proud I attended one of the final NBA games of Michael Jordan's career. He faced off against Yao Ming's Houston Rockets. You may remember Jordan's star shining with the Chicago Bulls. But when I was in Virginia, he dusted off his gym shoes and joined the Washington Wizards.@chicagobulls can’t miss out on my Bulls! #BullsNation https://t.co/eReMY7wjCS@wojespn Salty @chicagobulls didn't sign himDang what we doing 🤦🏾‍♂️ @chicagobulls https://t.co/giisqK2dQiFunny thing is the Chicago bulls and Boston Celtics was actually double teaming Tony Campbell, just like the Lakers was doubling Carmelo Anthony! Tony Campbell is a load to defend one on one, Kobe Bryant would have his hands full, Tony seen the likes of MJ in his prime https://t.co/efcdlYNY3I@phibacka31 @ReggieMillerTNT Hellyeah! Felt like I was betraying some of my family, since half are from Chicago, but they’ll forgive me since the Bulls took the series. Have good MJ &amp; Kobe footage, but feel like that’s sacred. Reggie was so fun to watch. I think about the 8 points in 9 seconds all the time.@chicagobulls wtf man!

He completely took over the final few minutes of the game and won with Scottie barely being able to walk and Rodman being out of gas as well.

Lifelong fan. Peace.@MrSantosLive @NBA @NBAonTNT @chicagobulls Caruso was invited, but he declined. He said he prefers to save his dunks for actual games.@BleacherReport @wojespn @chicagobulls should have put a strong pitch in for his services.Chicago sports fans are so freaking dramatic.  The Bulls lose one game in a LONG season and everyone loses their minds.  The White Sox won't overpay for free agents and they lose their minds.  The Bears...I understand that 😂.  Calm.  Tf.

I hope Armin van Buuren made him known all over the United States as he played in the NBA's Chicago Bulls vs. New York Knicks halftime.

Minimum 40 attempts so far this season.
Chris Paul 53.5%
Devin Booker 45.2% 

45% is NOT good.

Only 11 players in the league shoot over 50% from midrange which only proves the analytics folks that it is not an efficient shot in the league.@chicagobulls @NikolaVucevic When I get backChicago Bulls guard Alex Caruso talked about Los Angeles Lakers undrafted rookie Austin Reaves.  https://t.co/XvMeuWj1He@Jumpshot8 @IsiahThomas @Suns @chicagobulls I’d be as out of place on an nba court as you are in math.
