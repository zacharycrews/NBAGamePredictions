This is well coached and Giannis is becoming even more better now. Playoff Kris is coming up too. I don’t see why this team won’t win back to back titles again.The NBA really hate the @Suns@Suns @PlayAtGila Birthday part is messed up@euroear @warriors @Bucks @Suns I can’t front it’s possible"The Phoenix Suns are on a different level, and they are clearly the team to beat" - Stephen A. Smith claims only Golden State Warriors can get better of Chris Paul and co. https://t.co/Ydl7IsXfx5 #NBA #BasketballHow are we going to evaluate Chris Paul's legacy if his 64-win Phoenix Suns team fails to win the championship this year?

Well, the Phoenix coach won by going to the winning team's locker room last season to say, "See you guys soon."

They are worried about game 3 against the Dallas mavericks 

Bottom line is Utah needed a split to take homecourt and that’s what they got. Everything else is literally window dressing https://t.co/sQB7HeM0XP@Suns @Verizon What a Sicko…The only team in the west that could possibly matchup with the warriors is the Phoenix Suns. They have great 3&amp;D wings who can limit shooters, and they also have 3 Bigs. The Suns have size on the Warriors and are the only team that can matchup with them. They will see eachother.Is there a better uni in the NBA??

He changed their culture lol CP3 is the Mvp of the Suns so how is Booker the MVP of the league? LolFolks your take what’s better for the Knicks if the Mavs or Jazz lose. Personally even if the Jazz gets past Dallas they aren’t beating the Suns in the 2nd round. So if we want Brunson let the Mavs lose. Mitchell will want out if they lose now or to Phoenix.Game✌🏼@PelicansNBA v @Suns 

Keep it close - give yourself a chance to out hustle them in the final 4 minutes of the game. 

Have to see:

Jax make his cuts

Herb on Chris

More Jose, Trey from jump

No DG

A plan to get past Ayton

Congrats @Onsae13 ! 15 more! https://t.co/CzfLdpAtMHPelicans @ Suns

Here's the thing, the Phoenix Suns are very good. They may have slowed down a bit towards the end of the season but the first half against NOLA reminded us all. That being said, lots of respect for Pels heart and I expect a fight in this one.

Pelicans +10.5

4/4The @suns will meet @pelicansnba at the Footprint Center for their 2nd game in the NBA Playoffs 2022!! The @suns lead @pelicansnba by 1-0 so far.

If KLAY catches fire, it would be a great 7 game series, with the Warriors having a slight edge due to tons of Finals experience

After a tough win, #Kobe said the Warriors were "like the Phoenix Suns on steroids." If the #GSW are running on all cylinders, that metaphor's still true. #DENvsGSWphoenix suns ain’t winning anything this year 😂@kobalways_livin cant wait till u say you’ve “always been a phoenix suns fan” 😂@warriors The Warriors were keeping pace with the Phoenix Suns before Draymond's injury. Stephen Curry was leading MVP candidate. Draymond was leading DPOY candidate.

Philadelphia 76ers
Phoenix Suns 

- 9 times outta 10 thats our road to the finals &amp; I like Boston against ever opponent@angelinams112 @sunsgorilla @Suns It was nice to get to hang with you too!!  😉 Can’t wait until come back!@PhilboBaggins94 @ianw14 @CraigPColling @Espo @Suns Yes. The first guy said to go 15-6. The second guy said one down. If that one counts against the first guy's post, it leaves 14 wins. You need to win 15 from here so the one down doesn't matter if 15 is the goal (because it was already counted). Either way, my joke missed. My bad@mrskmart2015 @sunsgorilla @Suns Absolutely!!@alexadolphe_ @mikal_bridges What a shocker...people screwing over Bridges and the Phoenix Suns again.  It goes to an east coast team again.  Zero respect.  Use it to destroy every team in the playoffs and win the title (I know Mikal would rather have a championship over a DPOY award).@JenHale504 @PelicansNBA @Suns So so sweet !!@suns_tutu_fan @PhoenixMercury @Suns Awww was a pleasure to finally meet you. Your mom is adorable 😍 💕@angelinams112 @sunsgorilla @Suns It was so fun!!  Thank you for letting me cop it!
