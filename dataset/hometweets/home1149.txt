LAC played 5 perimeter players and attacked Rudy's understood deficiencies. In the contemporary NBA, Rudy is not nearly the "complete" defender Marcus is.Do #UtahJazz fans believe this team can still make a run in the playoffs? @44Bojan told us that not matter what it looks like from the outside, this team is bettered prepared for the playoffs than they were one year ago.

They targeted the jazz weak perimeter defenders specifically Mitchell on his hurt ankle and Conley. Forcing gobert to help in the middle to not give up a lay up, which meant having to leave Mann open in the corner@HoopsEmpire_ @rudygobert27 @celtics @utahjazz @BucketsONeale00 @epaschall Kinda hard to believe since he has surgery on a partially torn meniscus. Not really any precedent for it. But I would love to see it as an NBA fan@utjazzmuse @rudygobert27 @celtics @utahjazz @BucketsONeale00 @epaschall And I know all about center impact on defense, we have Rob Williams. But personally I think Marcus Smart is more important to the defense for more reasons, even though Rob is amazing@utjazzmuse @rudygobert27 @celtics @utahjazz @BucketsONeale00 @epaschall Heard he might be back sub-4 weeks which would be late first round/beginning of second round. If they get a favorable matchup in round one that bet could still be good.@utjazzmuse @rudygobert27 @celtics @utahjazz @BucketsONeale00 @epaschall Well that also goes into the fact that centers as a whole have the most “impact” because they guard the rim. While that is valuable, in todays age of three pointers and perimeter play, there is an argument that having more of a help defender or perimeter defense is more valuable@HoopsEmpire_ @rudygobert27 @celtics @utahjazz @BucketsONeale00 @epaschall Yep huge blow for celtics.

I’ve never needed Utah to win a game more than the one tonight. #GoJazz@utjazzmuse @rudygobert27 @celtics @utahjazz @BucketsONeale00 @epaschall Ending the opposing team's possession is more statistically impactful than blocking a shot. Additionally, it's a perimeter game; Marcus is a far more versatile and effective perimeter defender. Rudy stands and jumps and gives people COVID.@utjazzmuse @rudygobert27 @celtics @utahjazz @BucketsONeale00 @epaschall I don't remember saying they're the single most important defensive statistic but you're welcome to your weird interpretation.

All I know is that the statistic you chose to highlight doesn’t actually tell us anything about who’s a better defensive player@utjazzmuse @rudygobert27 @celtics @utahjazz @BucketsONeale00 @epaschall But like every hack stats person, we cherry pick what serves our narrative instead of actually looking at what are all the ways a defensive player can impact and then doing a statistical analysis of who’s better across all of them🏀 GAME ANALYSIS 🏀

https://t.co/NbmDnJZTGJ@MishMei @utahjazz I am BEGGING@utjazzmuse @rudygobert27 @celtics @utahjazz @BucketsONeale00 @epaschall To be clear, I haven’t looked into it either but just throwing out random suggestions about impact is completely meaningless. Pick some statistics dig into them and then make your claim. The statistics you stated in your original post are meaningless without further context@utjazzmuse @rudygobert27 @celtics @utahjazz @BucketsONeale00 @epaschall The question is, does this play out in the data. How many times is Marcus smart guarding the best perimeter player on the floor and he shoots far fewer field goals than he averages over the course of the season? This is important data that you clearly haven’t looked into.@pjwd_ @rudygobert27 @celtics @utahjazz @BucketsONeale00 @epaschall Meaning he has a significantly larger impact on defense because he's able to defend more than just his guy. Marcus smart has one defensive matchup to worry about. The guy you should be pushing for for dpoy is Robert williams🏀NBA🏀
Chicago Bulls vs Los Angeles Clippers

LA Clippers snapped their losing streak. They won against the Utah Jazz 121-115.💪

The Chicago Bulls also won the last game. They defeated Washington 107-94.🔥

Who will win this game?🥇 https://t.co/HZecy1sn9I@utjazzmuse @rudygobert27 @celtics @utahjazz @BucketsONeale00 @epaschall I mean, if you can test fewer shots it might be because players are more afraid to attempt field goals against you. Possibly because he’s defending them better. The fact that people take lots of shots against Rudy it’s probably more of a result of the fact that he is near the rim@_knicks1688 @StateNYKPOD @Not47Buddz @YankeesKnicks99 @eepdllc @TruePG718 @TMal761 @KnickedupFan @queens_dude @Rick__War @Woodshed_1914 @KnicksCentral @Knickanators @dan_ny_b @GodSonRel @AJTheManChild @C1231Will @SellDaTeamDolan @Christian_J_D_M @0oty_Mac @rahmmagick @EdMemphisPimpin @moonshadow2019 @PastorCoach917 @KnicksBig15 @LegionOfKnicks @RaphaelDiaz @the_process101 @DonaldP47082631 @NYKnDababy123 @Lilblacman3 @mikenieve @drosefan1616 @eski225 @MacksJulien @victorlb03 @BadBadLeroyBro7 @Trace_AVP @Freekeith @ShannonTFortune @Chuck1one @RTaylor2283 @Marxman35 @AngelBeingAngel @Sharonchik266 @stalling_e @J1gg__ @quietknicksfan @jfromflorida1 @acinformal Tyler Herro would be a legend in a Utah Jazz uniform!@dom_inDurham @rudygobert27 @celtics @utahjazz @BucketsONeale00 @epaschall Rudy Gobert has 2.9 stocks (steals + blocks) per game.

Dude looks GOOD rocking the red and black 😂🤙🏼💥 https://t.co/Z6nRiljs0E@utahjazz All I know is that the Jazz need to show up on Thurs against the Lakers and not throw this game.
Come ready to play to the end....
This is a  very important game and Utah needs to win it
DO NOT throw this game....pleaseThis lost just shows how the @utahjazz waste my boy @spidadmitchell’s value and scoring ability. No longer a Jazz fan, just a Spida fan.Worry bout yourself 💯 #utah #UtahJazz #fyp https://t.co/Sd7OkeIbbXAppreciate all the hard work the #UtahJazz and @spidadmitchell have put in all season! Keep your heads up, fellas. Through thick and thin, we got your back. Nothing but love. #jazznation@cou_rage00 I get your point sha
We Sha tried 
Poole and Draymond balled tf out 
I just want us to at least stay in this 4th seed Sha
Utah Jazz will be easy moneyAfter watching the Utah Jazz struggle all year I came to the conclusion that one of the main problems they have is that they seem to think that small things don’t matter and it adds up. Also one of the things the gives me a tiny bit of hope #takenote #utahjazz@Dunzod There’s alternative timelines were Chris Paul is a Utah Jazz legend😭😭

This timeline has the Jazz picking Deron Williams over him and then Mike Conley😭😭@SpencerJCox please call on the state of Utah in prayer. The Utah Jazz have been in a winning drought. May we all come together and make it rain … from 3An #NBA regular season game between Los Angeles #Clippers and Utah #Jazz was on live broadcast of the sports channel of China Central Television for the first time in 17 months. Observers believed it is going to be a full return, instead of a temporary one, media reports. https://t.co/d5iM1S20MXUpdates from the Road: That Ole Utah Jazz https://t.co/WqIhfkHhGLMake it make sense @utahjazz @SacramentoKings @Lakers @spurs @PelicansNBA https://t.co/xP3v7PFlyd@JimboRudding I think Ryan Smith should hire the Utah Jazz Podcast with Video as the Jazz new head coach next year, because then, and only then, we would win by triple digits to single digits for years to come. You heard it here first.Out of all games my kids were going to go watch their first @Lakers game. Playing against the @utahjazz but @KingJames ain’t playing or @AntDavis23@jazzmomm ...meaning you have a relationship with the Utah Jazz.
It's like smoking folks. There isn't such a thing as a healthy smoke.Any athlete who wears a Utah jazz jersey https://t.co/Dhwbn3O4y4@Morelife240 The regular season is NOT the playoffs. Ask the Utah Jazz. Ask the Lob City Clippers.Current Western Conference standings

Reminder: Deron had a better head to head matchup vs CP3 because he had a better team!!! Can't imagine how good Jerry Sloan and the Utah Jazz will be with CP3 instead of Deron.

📱https://t.co/ZsXWn9m5a5 https://t.co/pBmN24ia4jIf I were the Utah Jazz, I’d rest all my good players the next 2 games. GS drops to 4th when they lose tonight, let Denver pass you in the standings. Take your chances with Dallas. Playing GS first round, lol.@TheNamesEdward @Ciroc__0bama @SpencerKeele @utahjazz Home court that didn’t mean shit when the Jazz were tied 2-2 with a Kawhi-less LA@mcconkatroid @utahjazz FactIsaiah Hartenstein came in clutch against the Utah Jazz.
https://t.co/znpuRmAlrD@Montez25155507 @Marino87484600 @LakeShowYo If the Utah jazz are a joke than the lakers are an absolute clown festThe Utah Jazz most likely opponent as of right now is the Golden State warriors in round one. Golden State the 4 seed with home court advantage. Mavericks beat the warriors 3-1 this season so they are the most likely 3 seed. Jazz are given a 54% likelihood to finish 5th in West https://t.co/mPC6Vek1jv@aaronsmit07 @TheMontyShow @rudygobert27 I know someone that knows someone in the Utah Jazz organization and his agent and Donovan spida Mitchell and Ryan Smith had a meeting and talked about build the team around Donovan Mitchell and he said to Ryan Smith that he doesn't want to leave and people close to him said it toEnjoying @NBA AF! S/o to Memphis Grizzlies ! Jone &amp; Brooks really held it down!

He makes it to Salt Lake for the game and he’s got a ticket waiting! 😂@aaronsmit07 @TheMontyShow @rudygobert27 Donovan Mitchell never has said he wants out of the Utah Jazz and he has never asked for a trade he's never ever said that. You know that why are people saying it when he has never said anything about what to leave.@utahjazz @UofUHealth Please don't pretend this matters to anyone...

The argument is that he provides hi value on offense. You are just incapable of comprehending anything beyond basic stats.@aaronsmit07 @TheMontyShow @rudygobert27 They would not trade Donovan Mitchell at all. If the ORGANIZATION Utah Jazz team and ownership have there way. It's not gonna happen cause Rudy gobert would be trade first.
