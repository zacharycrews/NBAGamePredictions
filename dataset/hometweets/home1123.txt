LeBron James #6 of the Miami Heat wore a black carbon fiber mask to begin the game against the New York Knicks at American Airlines Arena on February 27, 2014 in Miami.@MiamiHEAT @therabody @raf_tyler Tell Tyler  that Seth loves himNBA teams without plural names are so confusing to me. Example: 
Jalen Green is a Houston Rocket. 
PJ Tucker is a Miami Heat???

Ja Morant is a Memphis Grizzly

Case &amp; point the Miami Heat have signed &amp; developed too many 2 guards to name, who have become successful players so signing an under valued player isn't out of the question.The Sacramento Kings will aim to secure a 3-0 start to the road trip tonight when they face the Miami Heat 🔥

Easy sweep@Greentips_1 I knew Golden State warriors will lose. They have lost almost all their recent matches and won against miami heat which was shocking. I knew if they will win it won't be more than 10points. So I went +8.5 in favor of washington wizards. I a genius tooMe waiting for the Miami Heat to finally win a game again https://t.co/nKTEDRZ8WvFor those of you who don’t know this, but I lived in Ft Lauderdale for 5 months back in 2014. 

Fell in love with South Florida sports teams. 

Love the Florida Panthers, Miami #Dolphins and soft side for the Miami #Marlins. 

HATE the Miami Heat tho. #SoFlo 🌴

Part Goodfellas, part Heat, part Miami Vice. https://t.co/u1SbXpYVDo@JoGiovanni_ @DeanRyder9 @TheTruthh115 @AJ_Capalxt So what exactly was Miami outside of LeBron? D-Wade with arthritic knees? 37 year old Ray Allen? Mike Miller? Udonis Haslem? Mario Chalmers? Shane Battier? Again, by your definition, the Heat were filled with plumbers too. So again, your point?@MiamiHEAT
