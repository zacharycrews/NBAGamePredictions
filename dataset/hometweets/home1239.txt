Warriors are different in the playoffs. No Steph but Klay hightens his play without him. They have a team with shooters. Denver allows opponents to shoot at high clip. This could get ugly if Nugs shoot poorly from 3.

https://t.co/GjYeu3XfUO https://t.co/VFCp6IIWYpHave this one projected to end 4-1 Golden State. We've got a game of wiggle room but fully expecting the Warriors to dominate a short-handed Nuggets team. Liked this even w/ the Curry uncertainty, absolutely love it with him probable for game 1.

Warriors have championship DNA, they are not losing in round 1. Denver's only chance is if Steph misses multiple games. Jokic will likely become 2x MVP, if he had Murray and/or MPJ I might be predicting a Denver Win.

Jokic will be spectacular but won’t get much help. But for the Warriors: are they gonna look like fully loaded dynasty Golden State or the slightly out of rhythm version? I’ll say GSW in 7.Ahead of the 2022 NBA Playoffs, the Golden State Warriors are composed of players with a mix of youth and experienced players, who have stepped onto the biggest stage.

Let's go @warriors https://t.co/W4dsJL7RiX@pschof1 @TheVolumeSports @Money23Green @StephenCurry30 @warriors Repeat, you don't know the basketball.
Dray is the real point guard of the Warriors. He set the speed, The tone, and he's one of the best screener ever. And one of the best defensive anchor ever: he had to receive at least 2 DPOY.
The fortunes of Steph &amp; Klay are chained with him@TodayInSports3 @mfarrellsports @ForTheWin @celtics @warriors @RexChapman Larry Legend!Question Of The Day: What is Allen Iverson’s career-high number of points scored against the Miami Heat?

The answer will be announced after Game 1 of the Denver Nuggets-Golden State Warriors NBA Playoffs Series on ABC tonight. https://t.co/89jV2nYSFT@warriors Gratitude!@NBATurkiye Golden state warriors@warriors Gratitude@kirkgoldsberry @celtics @memgrizz @Raptors @Suns @BrooklynNets @chicagobulls @nuggets @warriors I thought Jokic was a “good” defender yet his team defense stinks. If you’re a defensive anchor like some “stats” back up they team D should be better. @ZachLowe_NBA @KevinOConnorNBA@warriors this is so… dramatic and i love itin second pick, golden state warriors select james wiseman@RealSkipBayless I get it when sports analysts have to come up w/ explosive tweets to generate attention. But it’s another thing to say something stupid! The Warriors are back and they are only gonna get better in the yrs to come.

Boston is obviously impressive but comparing a team that’s fighting for seeding with a team resting starters for the playoffs isn’t apples to apples.@davidgriffin100 @nuggets @warriors Can't think of 5, but number one has to defense, especially on Curry. Do NOT let him go off.@_b0y1da_ @chefwardell_30 @WarriorslsOn @warriors Facts had that perfect half in theseIt's playoff season. 

Of course, I'm rooting for us @warriors, and I'd hope 🤞🏽 we meet the Suns, for they remind me of our 2015 team. 

But... Curry, Klay and Draymond haven't played more than 11 minutes in 3 years. So, it does not matter. Jus ball. https://t.co/0n907y0FGLCollection: The Golden State Warriors 2022 Playoff NFT Collection

Passing, defense, rebounding, mean streak, leadership…not to mention also being one of the best shooters ever.
