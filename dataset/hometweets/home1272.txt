With Booker still expected to be out, can New Orleans take advantage of his absence in Game 5️⃣? 🤕

🏟🏀 Phoenix Suns vs New Orleans Pelicans

Chris Paul Under 24.5 Points + Rebounds

-Û🐐@adamArnold357 @Pels12NorthLA @PelicansNBA @Suns Yeah I’m leaning towards bring him back next year.Maybe it's the homer in me but I am predicting the improbable @PelicansNBA beat Suns in GM 5 tonight in Phoenix 
All the pressure is on the Suns I'm expecting the Suns to hit Pels with haymakers but Green &amp; his staff have been able to adjust &amp; this team is resilient &amp; confident@LyleSwithenbank @Pels12NorthLA @PelicansNBA @Suns Exactly the same. I think letting him come off the bench a few minutes for a game or 2  in round 2 just to see how it goes maybe. Idk.Could mess with rotation or chemistry or could work perfectly really a coin flip as this point.Probably just let him be til next season to be safe@ZenithOfChaos @80percentoff @Santinobambino3 @Suns didnt read https://t.co/pmWn7U1kZtThe 5: Most recent Phoenix Suns 2-2 series outcomes – NBA News https://t.co/KJtdFKIidd@Kenneth63372372 @suns_tutu_fan @Suns @Suns_Armband Love the hat bro!!NBA Basketball Game Betting Picks Simulator: 10:00 PM ET - New Orleans Pelicans vs. Phoenix Suns - YOU CAN RUN THE GAME SIMULATION FOR FREE HERE: https://t.co/rTHwYNQwbi #nba #gamblingtwitter #sportsbetting #freepicks #cappertek@Suns @FootprintCNTR @MichelobULTRA Suns going off tonight.

Let’s freakin’ GOOOOOOoooooo #ValleyProud 💜🧡@ZenithOfChaos @80percentoff @Santinobambino3 @Suns How does that contradict anything I say? Better hope your team shows up tonight, otherwise its over in 6.The #Suns were called for 28 fouls in Game 4. The #Pelicans were whistled for 16. 

New Orleans was 32-for-42 from the line. Phoenix went 10-for-15.

But, if it's any consolation, the #NBA says it did miss a flagrant foul on New Orleans.  #WBD #ValleyProud https://t.co/XC8TVfnRUa@LyleSwithenbank @Pels12NorthLA @PelicansNBA @Suns Hope ur right 6 sounds great to me.

I lived in Phoenix those years and even rabid Suns fans never ever ever EVER called that team a super team. It was one of their greater teams and Barkley was their biggest star, but super team?

MORE: https://t.co/AxxqBP2PoI https://t.co/uRxzJTfoeVIn the lead-up to whether an 0-3 comeback is possible, it's worth noting that in the regular season the Toronto Raptors tied the Phoenix Suns and Memphis Grizzlies for the greatest number of streaks in the 21/22 season at 5, and averaged about 6 wins across that stretch.@stbpike24 @otc_wizard @NBA @Suns @NBAonTNT Please stay on topic. It’s not confusing at all.@Whitebird480 @JaValeMcGee @Suns_Armband @Suns ALWAYS! 😈🔥😈When was the last time a playoff team had more points in the paint, but shot 35% or lower FTs than the other team? 

Game 4:
Suns points in the paint 56
FTs 15

Pels points in the paint 54
FTs 42

In fact, almost every stat was even except the Pels had a few more rebounds and the Suns somehow had 2x fouls and 1/3 free throws.

Between leadership from Monty Williams, Chris Paul &amp; Jae Crowder, I believe we will  see the best version possible (without Booker) of the Suns tonight.we cannot lose on al’s bday that would be disrespectful @suns https://t.co/tmpnJRuHV989 years strong &amp; 50 seasons of @Suns basketball.

Happy birthday to 𝓉𝒽𝑒 𝓁𝑒𝑔𝑒𝓃𝒹 🎙 https://t.co/mXVL8aVawh@NBA @ByronSpruell maybe you can use the proceeds from @Suns Monty Williams “donation”  to go toward medical services to pull the collective heads of the refs out of their asses. Not just for @suns benefit- officiating has been poor to a point of nauseam for ALL games. #dobetter https://t.co/ZoQX7D5tpX2nite’s game plan; starters CP, twins,Shamet &amp; DA..CP plays in 4min increments with pace to keep him fresh for 4th, more ball &amp; player movement, anyone other than 5 push the pace after rebounding, press 94ft to disrupt offense, @Suns find mins for Holiday @Monty_Williams_@matbabiarz Run&amp;Gun Phoenix Suns D'Antoniego😅@GoRilla_AZ1 @Suns @AZSports Thats awesome!!!

Best of luck to all!@FootprintCNTR @Suns Free jersey?@MiguelJuanTabo3 @Suns That is a practiced art to draw the technical@milesaweek @Suns 👍👍 he needed to complain. It doesn’t appear to be in Monty’s demeanor but I would have liked to seen how Suns would of responded if Monty was angry on the sidelines towards the officials.  A Technical or being tossed might have charged up the team.  They were flat 2nd half.@Emack5inAz @Suns @AZSports Thank you Eli. 🙏@Santinobambino3 @Suns @AZSports Thank you 🙏@Timberwolves @NBA2K From my couch in Phoenix, AZ.

Until the Celtics demonstrate they can win playoff games without a Tatum, Smart, or Brown, Phoenix delivering without Booker illustrates the quality of their depth, cohesion, coaching, and character.@SoyBateMan @Suns @Stathead @JaValeMcGee My favorite part of the embarrassing game on Sunday was when they threw in all their bench players, and Holiday instantly scored 4 points, trying harder than anyone that night1-1 yesterday.

The suns got screwed so hard. They will win today@GeraldBourguet I have struggled to be an @NBA fan over the years due to a # of factors, with certain players/teams always seeming to be treated differently by refs. This season/postseason not helping their case. The only thing keeping me watching is how much I love watching this @Suns team.@nasirProd @Suns @Stathead @JaValeMcGee Yeah, it's a good point. I think with DA up high for the pick and roll with CP3, Javale on the block down below and 2 guys on the wings, it would give us a bigger presence. Especially with 2 bigs down low on defense getting boards.@barstoolsports This would make more sense if Barkley jumped ship during his Phoenix Suns run in his absolute MVP prime… so what maybe he tried to chase at the end, everyone in that pic was washed lol @KDTrey5 tryna make it seem like Barkley left the Suns to join MJ in 94 #NahThatsWhatUDidKev@Suns Happy Birthday!Phoenix Suns' Monty Williams says free throw disparity in Game 4 loss to New Orleans Pelicans something 'you have to look at'

He lead the Phoenix Suns all the way to the NBA Finals, where they would push MJ and the bulls to six games. His best players were Dan Majerle and Kevin Johnson.

#RallyTheValleyKD ain’t post no pics of Phoenix Suns MVP Barkley though 🤷🏽‍♂️2) In our 2018 paper, we argued the Sun Belt/Mountain's large metros were truer textbook definitions of "core" investments. That's showing up more in today's cap rates -- led by Austin, Phoenix, Raleigh, Dallas, Denver, Salt Lake, Nashville, Charlotte, Orlando, and Atlanta. (4/6)The basketball world and media seem more concerned with how many free throws the Phoenix Suns shoot than one of the all-time great basketball players (Brittney Griner) indefinite incarceration in Russia. https://t.co/Gd8JsOR7o9@DiscoPaco @SynergySST @warriors @Suns @memgrizz @MiamiHEAT @utahjazz @ATLHawks @NBA I’m assuming possession per game@Suns you guys better not be unstoppable in the regular season and than lose to the @PelicansNBA in round one@BleacherReport KD ain’t showed not 1 Barkley pic of him being on the @Suns 😂 Big Troll …It's my birthday!

I have 12 direct reports, told everyone yesterday I’m giving out $10 Starbucks Gift Cards to anyone wearing something that shows Suns support. Hope to give them all away. @Suns https://t.co/VreWxbYMwQ@Gibadib I am rooting for Phoenix. Dallas as a dark horse. But truth be told most West teams I wouldn’t mind taking it. 

Suns because Chris Paul def deserves a ring before he retires.@CoorsGato @Suns @FootprintCNTR I respect Jones as a young player got wonderful performance last night. What I cannot agree with is just his attitude towards a respectful older player. That's my opinion. You can also disagree with me. Fair enough.If I were the Phoenix Suns, I would simply shoot better tonight 😌@CoorsGato @Suns @FootprintCNTR To be honest no. If you say so, Jones also hit Ayton in the previous game. I don't think he did that on purpose, the same as I don't think Paul wanted to hurt Jones. This was a game. Actually Paul was doing a clean foul. He didn't want Jones to get the ball in, that's it.If I were the Mavericks, I would simply beat the Phoenix Suns next round.Game day meal. Oatmeal with fresh blueberries.  Suns players, please make sure you have a balanced breakfast, properly fueling yourself before tonight’s game.  Feel free to follow me for more health conscious tips. Most of my content is free.  It’s what I do people. 
@Suns https://t.co/1XalQueELRWe're making a run for the triple-digits today! 

Phoenix &amp; a few other Valley cities could reach 100 today.

Not a guarantee but it's possible, so we'll be watching temps closely!

Either way, take care of yourself by hydrating &amp; limiting time in the sun.

#abc15wx #azwx #azheat https://t.co/BfaUOtY46I@cksjsn @Suns @FootprintCNTR Thanks for telling. I have remembered this young guy. I respect every hardworking player, wish they can respect others as well. P&amp;LMy Suns are in a funk in this 1st Round.  But, remember, they also were 1993 against an 8th seed Laker squad during the Barkley Suns.  Paul Westphal boldly proclaimed wins in the next three.  Monty needs to do that for this series. @Dbook4mvp_ @Suns@statmuse THIS is what us "old heads" been trying to tell these youngins. That 3ball style of play won't cut it when it comes to the POs when the game slows down and is more physical. 💪🏾
90s teams would run these teams OUT THE GYM.

https://t.co/wjsAjHMykiCheck out this listing I just added to my #Poshmark closet: Phoenix Suns Snapback Cap. https://t.co/myMl3RANNs #shopmycloset @poshmarkapp@Barmelo_ The three way trade with Indiana Phoenix and the Cavs that would have got Bledsoe and PG to the cavs and Kyrie was going to the Suns but they wasn’t trying trade the 4th pick lol@Jumpshot8 @Suns EJ, do you get to talk to these guys on the plane??? I love your take on forcing contact and it motivates the heck out of me!🆕 Suns Take Home Court Advantage Back to Phoenix (Covering Games 3 and 4 in New Orleans)

https://t.co/VCRpMM6Q3J@Suns heard there’s and opening for 🎟 manager … You can trust me!!@XfrankensteinXl @devinbookerphx1 @Suns yeah true. its gonna be a good series for sure. wouldnt be surprised if either team wins in 6. but rlly hoping it goes to 7The @NBA is saving Scott foster for game 7 in Phoenix for Chris Paul and the suns unbelievable! #Phoenixsuns #Suns #NBAPlayoffs #Nba #RallyTheValley #NBATwitterTeams that great in regular season #nba:

But trash in the #NBAPlayoffs2022Doesn't get much better than Gold and Silver. #willtheautographguy #panini #paniniamerica #whodoyoucollect #thehobby #nba #amarestoudemire #phoenixsuns https://t.co/pV8X3a18hk@Jumpshot8 @Suns @Jumpshot8 could have been a great lawyer!!!Are the @Suns and @sixers on upset alert? #NBAPlayoffsJust like the Phoenix Suns last season, the Celtics were fearless and didn't try to avoid facing anybody in 1st round. Huge respect for those teams not running from the grind and challenge. That's championship DNA. Something Ben Simmons doesn't haveThe Narrative keeps changing @suns fans but it never did on my watch.  #devinbooker #nbamvp. https://t.co/QVtNWnMv6AIf Dallas can get past the Suns (if Phoenix wins the series), I think the Mavericks have the best chance at the NBA Finals out of the West
#NBAPlayoffsA few years ago I was all in on KD to DC until he by past us soooo now I'm not a huge fan🤷🏽‍♀️ Let rock with our young squad and continue build like Golden State, they didn't need KD... Memphis Grizzlies, or the Phoenix suns https://t.co/N4oXpZBmbc@Jumpshot8 @Suns Been waiting my whole life for the ship for my Suns...Now at 42, thought this was the year, but dear lord, at some point our wings have to wake up and start knocking down open shots!The @NBA haven't been this spicey in a decade. I can't stop watching these games and the drama unfold OMG. @JHarden13 left @BrooklynNets @KyrieIrving missed most the season. Nets getting swept Harden is WASHED @Suns @CP3 fighting for their Lives. I need some milk too Spicey!@Suns Bench Crowder, play Ayton and McGee together, bring Byombo and Ish in off the bench, bench Payne, bring in Holiday.@HunterGilreath1 @devinbookerphx1 @Suns Yeah but you had almost 40 of those in the first half. The suns have been beaten every 3rd quarter this series. The second half the suns settled and it shows.@GeraldBourguet The Phoenix Suns remain out for Game 5, per Suns.Booker refusing to play after being injured is a telltale sign that he wants out of Phoenix. I say the Suns trade him to the Knicks; a place where he would prefer to be.@esidery Until the @Suns recover from their 3pt drought, they need to attack the basket@suavej206 It’s fuck everybody cmon @Suns let’s get it@JaMorant definitely one of my two favorite hoopers not on the @Suns https://t.co/9LCGfipbjS@ScooterMagruder Turks and Caicos, Dallas Cowboys and the Phoenix SunsEveryone complaining about the suns gtfo @Suns@ThatDamnBear @Suns not reading that essay stay mad@CashNasty Exactly if Anthony Davis did not get injured last year they would have knocked the Phoenix Suns out I have no doubt about it they were whooping them 2 games to 1 But people would have acted like the suns were no problem He wouldn't have gotten the credit anyway@ThatDamnBear @PIutoP @Suns It got you mad enough to comment, that’s a W in my bookDUNKED: Basketball
