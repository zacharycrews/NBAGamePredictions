The Hornets next 3 games: Cleveland, Miami, Toronto

I’m liking Jaylen Brown of the Boston #Celtics to go over 25.5 points. Brown’s average for the season sits at 24.4 but he has picked it up the last 4 games (30,26,31,29). Charlotte gives up the 3rd most points and the most 3s to SG. #GamblingTwitter“Players were asking and demanding and wanting to see more guys who looked like them ... There’s a natural cultural bond that Black coaches are going to have with their players,” @Celtics Coach #ImeUdoka told the Times.@frostingnotcake @MoooseSZN @celtics Look at the centers around the league…Al is still one of the best defenders at the position
