LAL 4.5 -110The Los Angeles Lakers had an offer from the Houston Rockets of John Wall for Russell Westbrook that would not have included their 2027 first round pick. The Lakers reportedly were not ready to give up on the idea of the team figuring out to play with Westbrook.Congratulations to Wilt100 (@TopShotWilt) and nowbrewing who moved up to take #25 and #98 on the Los Angeles Lakers team leaderboard.
