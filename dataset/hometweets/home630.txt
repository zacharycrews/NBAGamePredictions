The "ruin" I worry about comes in a year or two.@SactownAnthony @robbybiegler Sure but that guy also has a very good argument for league MVP at this exact moment too so I would struggle to say that he's anything less than better than any Sacramento King everHe said he wanna be utilzed as a scorer, we can use one of dem, check DM @SacramentoKings https://t.co/UPOTw4YHLk https://t.co/RQv0JtLuQz@SacramentoKings Hoping for the same results.@king_dven Seems impossible and would mean Sacramento would be hitting a full reset button.

The Sacramento Kings started the season 5-4. They are 12-23 since that point.
