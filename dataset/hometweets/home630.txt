#Cavs #LetEmKnowNot too sure why the Kings make this deal. Fox may be having a down season, but he’s younger and a better piece to have in the long run.

So Lebron James wants to start games at Center, which is the “Last Wall of Defense” but Lebron gets a free pass on defense ?

It's a losing strategy against Top 20 NBA teams.@ChewieWoolf @_Puzzlepiecedad @nbatopshot @SacramentoKings Nice! TS homerg29 👍The NBA has banned this Kings’ “Ice Cold Player of the Game” postgame segment.

They have recently used it on Russell Westbrook after he shot 2-of-14 FG in a loss to Sacramento.

😳🤔 https://t.co/8APQ4CGaOY@JJMaples55_MST Hopefully Myles Turner to the rescue. The Lakers gave up 70 points in the paint to the lowly Sacramento Kings.

Your supposed to get made fun of at the opposing arena to get you off your game.The NBA has banned the Sacramento Kings’ “Ice Cold Player of the Game” postgame segment after they used it on Russell Westbrook after he shot 2/14 FGM in a LOSS to the Kings. 

The arena also played the song “Cold As Ice” after Westbrook missed shots.
