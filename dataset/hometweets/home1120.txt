I’ve never seen that ever for a team since I started watching the NBA 20+ years ago.@ReggieGOATTT @hornets @BankofAmerica Everyone should be using preventative measures during sex regardless of sexual orientation, imo.@KyleBaileyClub @hornets How can we get a fan/supporter section at Spectrum?@KyleBaileyClub @hornets I’d love to hear what Mitch thinks about the incredible job Hubert Davis has done in his first year, and his thoughts on UNC/Duke meeting in the Final Four! https://t.co/xayEgOPoTg@BLCity5 @KyleBaileyClub @hornets Your initial comment came off as snarky and insincere. It was less of a question and more of a sarcastic way to try to drive the point that it was a loss on your team due to scheduling. Your initial comment was driving a narrative not what I said.@melonFball @KyleBaileyClub @hornets I asked a simple question about a beneficial stretch of the season. I didn’t say the entire season was beneficial for them. Quit making up narratives now@BLCity5 @KyleBaileyClub @hornets You were crying about the hornets schedule like we haven’t had a much tougher schedule than you guys. It was quite sad and desperate.@BLCity5 @KyleBaileyClub @hornets And we beat you the time before that. You guys are the league version of erectile dysfunction.

This was going back to their Bobcats days.@melonFball @KyleBaileyClub @hornets We just blew you guys out 3 weeks ago. We blew out Miami a better team a night before we even played you.@BLCity5 @KyleBaileyClub @hornets Ok and this non championship contender team with 0 stars just obliterated, sonned, and emasculated your team to the point where obsessed fans have to go and spam on every hornets related tweet crying and finding every excuse under the sun.

#TeamParieurTreating the @hornets play in like it’s Game 7 of the finals@BLCity5 @KyleBaileyClub @hornets For six seasons in a row Charlotte had more back to backs than any other team. Sit this one out.@BLCity5 @machikooo22 @KyleBaileyClub @hornets That’s because the clippers were actually gutted by injury, they didn’t have enough players to experiment like you guys. Nash has tried every trick in the book to make it work.@MONSTATREZZ and @isaiahthomas have been killing it for the @hornets in the second half of the season!

Are they the best mid-season acquisitions ever for the #Swarm?

@_JasonHuber takes a look at the all-time record book!
https://t.co/eva5zFt3NQ@BLCity5 @KyleBaileyClub @hornets Sure but that was a decision your FO made when they decided to lean on these stars instead of building traditionally. Quick success always comes at a cost.@ReggieGOATTT @hornets @BankofAmerica Sexual activity regardless of the genders of the consenting adults is risky. All people can minimize the risk of spreading potentially life threatening STIs by using preventative measures. Telling siblings not to fuck isn't discrimination, its a preventative measure.@hornets last night was something else :) https://t.co/XtMGUg61Kk@LadiesLovePete @DavidKyle @hornets @flow_blockchain Hmmm.

🏀 Chicago Bulls - New York Knicks

🏀 Sacramento Kings - Miami Heat
🏀 Atlanta Hawks - Indiana Pacers
🏀 Denver Nuggets - Charlotte Hornets@biratebryan @hornets @BankofAmerica What about the plethora of STDs you can catch from gay activities? And the alarmingly higher rates at which gay ppl catch those STDs compared to straight ppl? But whatever. Let's say the sibling ensure they are ALWAYS protected. Then what? Still going to discriminate?Happy anniversary to the time I won a Michael Jordan prize package through the @hornets (then Bobcats) and it was delivered about 7 weeks later looking like this. https://t.co/9EZygRAsMH@machikooo22 @BLCity5 @KyleBaileyClub @hornets Sure let’s completely ignore the clippers though 😂@KyleBaileyClub @hornets Will the ticket prices go up for the playoff series..@BLCity5 @KyleBaileyClub @hornets Having people quit on your team mid game is a culture/locker room issue which is self induced. You guys knew what you signed up for by signing all these stars. Built too high too quick and it’s bound to topple, thankfully for you KD and Kai are tight.@melonFball @BLCity5 @KyleBaileyClub @hornets Kyrie has missed over 50 games, kd has missed about 20, Ben Simmons still hasn’t played a game yet, a superstar was tanking games with us and we still tied for 8th in the east. This is definitely the most adversity any team has ever had to face.@CrownClubCLT I’ll be wearing my @MilesBridges city jersey. I’ve worn it to every game I’ve been to since I got it and the @hornets are 4-0 for those games.@KyleBaileyClub @hornets How is Kai Jones coming along in the G-League?

Thoughts on drafting a 5 this year, does he feel that is still a big need for the team?@ReggieGOATTT @hornets @BankofAmerica Because no amount of scientific data suggests that children born to or raised by same sex couples are at any developmental disadvantages compared to children born to straight couples. Children born of incest have a high risk of developmental issues. That's the difference.@KyleBaileyClub @hornets How do you feel about Kai Jones' progression/growth in the G-Leauge this year? And roster impact next year?@melonFball @KyleBaileyClub @hornets Tell me one team that had more injuries &amp; had a Star literally quit on the team mid season?@KyleBaileyClub @hornets Will he be in the Showtime miniseries, and if so, who's playing him... 😂@KyleBaileyClub @hornets Didn’t blame the loss on the schedule. I am just questioning why the Hornets played 4 teams on a 2nd half of a back to back in a week. The rest did play a factor yesterday, but it was a bad loss for the Nets nonetheless.Yall let Will Smith distract yall from LaMelo Ball and the @hornets winning 9 of their last 12@BLCity5 @KyleBaileyClub @hornets Saying the nets had the most adversity  of any team is actually laughable. It was mostly self induced and you want a pity party. Just take the L and move on there’s still plenty of games ahead.@KyleBaileyClub @hornets Does he think Will Smith actually slapped Rock?@melonFball @KyleBaileyClub @hornets The Nets have had to deal with a lot more adversity &amp; injuries this season than any other team.@BLCity5 @hornets My point isn’t that it’s unprecedented, it’s that schedules ebb and flow. Don’t blame the loss on the damn schedule. That’s soft.@BLCity5 @KyleBaileyClub @hornets We had one of the toughest schedules earlier in the season, this stretch doesn’t nearly make up for it. Stop crying cause your team lost and suck it up. You guys have a much easier remaining schedule and we’re tied gonna be tough to match you guys and stay ahead of you so chill.@KyleBaileyClub @hornets Yes. The Nets have done that before.@biratebryan @hornets @BankofAmerica Ah, discrimination. Pretty hypocritical. Why does LGBT as a group discriminate against incest? Two consenting adults, happen to be siblings. Why shouldn't they be welcomed into the LGBT group?@BLCity5 @hornets Oh, please. You ever heard of a team playing over 2/3rds of their first 40 games on the road?TIP: Charlotte Hornets - Denver Nuggets, N.Jokic 27.5+, 1.85 by #tipster wrmm (profit this month: +96.24)

Honestly I think the Hornets had the best weekend of any team in this state.Kyrie went 6 for 22 tonight in his first home game in Brooklyn as the Nets lost 119-110 to the Charlotte Hornets...

Had he only taken 3 shots earlier on in this season the Nets wouldn't currently be in the 9th spot in the East.Good win @hornets@hornets I agreeToday's loss of @BrooklynNets to the @hornets will showcase a Win or Go Home game vs the @ATLHawks.

Wow what a game🔥🔥🔥 @hornets #allfly  #movingonupBig win for the @hornets. #AllFlyWhat a horrible disappointment for the @BrooklynNets tonight, a massive win for @hornets. It felt like Charlotte couldn't miss a 3 pointer. @KyrieIrving had a terrible game in first time back on the home court since the vaccine mandate exception went into effect in NYC.@RealSkipBayless I guarantee you he’s not gonna be talking about the Brooklyn Nets losing to the Charlotte hornets with Kyrie Irving. Kevin Durat shot 9-23. And is 9th seed in EastCongrats to the @hornets on running the Nets OFF THAT DAMN COURT tonight 💪🏾Fly, you beautiful Hornets! HUGE win for Charlotte over the Nets in Brooklyn.

CHA and BKN are now tied for the 8/9 seeds.

CLE (7th seed) is 3 games up on BKN in the L column. TOR (6th) is 4 games up. ATL (10th) is one game behind.

BKN has 7 games left and the pick sits at #16.Dem boyeeezzz bawlin!bawling!! @hornetsMy Hornets went from winning 2 games in February to only losing 3 games in March...this is literally the Most Charlotte Hornet shit ever lolEasily the biggest win of the year for the @hornets. No question.

They're now the 8th seed in the East. This win also gives them the tiebreaker over Brooklyn should they have the same record at season's end (2-1 vs BKN).

Hornets look to go 4-0 in NYC on Weds. at MSG. #AllFly@RaiderRapn @LeBronGoCrazyy @RealSkipBayless I guarantee you he’s not gonna be talking about the Brooklyn Nets losing to the Charlotte hornets with Kyrie Irving. Kevin Durat shot 9-23. And is 9th seed in East@hornets LETS GOOOOOAnd in one of the biggest games of the season, the @Hornets....ARE IN THE WIN COLUMN!!!! #PlayoffPush #EveryGameMatters #AllFly https://t.co/pZF3y6hAc0Nets lose to the Hornets 119-110.

Frustrating game. Brooklyn outplayed Charlotte in every aspect of the game but shot 20.6% on 3Ps, while CHA shot 53.1%. Hornets dodge a major bullet and put more play-in pressure on BKN.

Durant: 27 PTS, 9-24 FGs
