#BullsNation | #CHIvsSAC https://t.co/1WHjam7qJWThere's a chance he returns tonight as he is questionable, and they just got Alex Caruso back from injury as well.  The Sacramento Kings are just 2-8 SU in their last 10 games overall. Their trade at the deadline doesn't seem to be paying dividends at all as the Pacers got betterDasHaus made a bet!

Can you feel the resistance difference in practice &amp; game? That's why it's important to establish the hip pressure at the start of the game. 

ex: #Randle made like 8 threes, got pushy w/o calls... he felt refs let him do it, so Domas just backed offCan the Sacramento Kings serve as the NBA's stand by playoff team this year? Eastern or Western Conference.

@BSWest5 is joining the show to talk about the 2022 March Madness NBA Draft Prospects from the Sacramento Kings' point of view. https://t.co/kT9oWp2Mte@notthaticonguy @SacramentoKings It could all be so easy@itskiloboiii @SacramentoKings We would run this team FOR FREE better than any of these other m’fuckersI can literally get the @SacramentoKings to the playoffs in three moves.
1. Hire Kenny Atkinson as head coach. 2. Draft Keegan Murray. 3. Throw the absolute biggest bag you can at Zach Lavine, if not then go get someone  cheaper like TJ WarrenAnd the Sacramento Kings still have more titles than the Suns since that day, lmfao https://t.co/BgsfEBQatn@SuperbSportsM @progessivechud @ThaTurnerIV @DrissHenrique @KayJayisDandy @statmuse Why punish kings fan because the owner suck?  We love basketball in Sacramento, we love the kings. Whenever the team shows a glimmer of hope we show out.

Every other coach has been a loser.Honestly, I feel grateful that I’m a #SacramentoKings fan!
