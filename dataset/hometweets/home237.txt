Bagley should be the starter at the 4 though. You aren’t going to tell me idc what the issues are that Fox, Hali, Barnes, Bagley, Holmes isn’t the best 5?

I’m fine with Jackson being involved but if we’re trading Grant it should be for a bigger piece to help us grow. Thompson/Bagley and 2nds are not it at all.@SacramentoKings This is so awesome already https://t.co/JNvSNKEimj@Reynald03003553 @WidsSportsTlk @SacramentoKings Grant isn’t doing anything productive for this team, Hami gets an expanded role (a good thing), we don’t have a big man rn if Stew is hurt, and Thompson is only here for cap reasons. Use Thompson as a trade piece at the deadline@sacramentokings your upper management and leadership sucks.

#WeTheNorth  #NBA75 |#Raptors | #SacramentoProud https://t.co/CLY0zZ30lOToronto typically shows the game down - the Kings have a poor halfcourt offense.

Sacramento allows the 3rd most OREB/g - the Raptors average the most.

Toronto averages the 2nd most steals/g - Luke Walton has been clear about his frustrations with the Kings live ball turnovers.@ThomasKCS @SacramentoKings @TheJetOnTNT @SneakerGarden You still live in Cincinnati or did you move ? Kidd Chris show isn’t the same without you manMatch: Sacramento Kings - Toronto Raptors

Pick a lane Kings. You don’t fight segregation and racial inequality with more segregation. Maybe your team should join a Chinese or N. Korean league instead?Sacramento Kings to beat Toronto Raptors @1.60I’ll be in Sac on 11/22.  Wanted to take my family of 5 to a @sacramentokings game. We can’t because of their Covid policies. That’s roughly $800 we would’ve spent. They don’t care, I get it, but if just 25k more people this season do what I just did, that’s a loss of $20M.@WhistleSports @55buckets Anyone interested in a White Chocolate autographed basketball I received directly from the Sacramento Kings?Sacramento kings Demarcus cousins #demarcuscousins #boogiecousins #demarcusamircousins #sacramentokings #neworleanspelicans #nbaallstar #losangeleslakers #houstonrockets #losangelesclippers https://t.co/nXnebsIsY1@SacramentoKings @nemi1599 @RealTristan13 @MB3FIVE This is your second cousin buddy call us at 8:00 810 2 sorry 810-6799 Freeport Bahamas love you this is Nation prophet@SacramentoKings @nemi1599 @RealTristan13 @MB3FIVE Bless the Lord oh my soul all that is within me bless his holy name forever more and forever more Jehovah God this is your cousin second cousin Prophet divine Mercy loving you Evangelist Garry A McIntosh Nation prophet@SacramentoKings where can I get some lower level seat for the game tomorrow for like $40We need some niggas off the Sacramento Kings.Check out 2020/21 Sacramento Kings Rookie RC Lot (4) - Select/Chronicles Draft Picks https://t.co/ZykugkVA8k@DunnDadda @swipathefox @SacramentoKings Pink pops on thatA few more photos I forgot to post from Minneapolis.
