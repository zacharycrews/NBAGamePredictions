It’s one thing to be a homer, but come on. Also, sideline out of bounds is not a TO. Gentry can call a play either way, BUT LA can’t set up their D if you push. Just silly.@sosatheactivist @SacramentoKings @hoopculture13 Kings the only losers around here.Laughing at how @Lakers &amp; fans get all juiced everytime they barely beat a medicore team like @SacramentoKings only to see them revert back to losing when they actually play teams over .500 😆 🤣 #NBAPlease cut tristian thompson already @SacramentoKings he got a spot with the Lakers waiting on himI think this happens to anyone who works for the @SacramentoKings https://t.co/Rukjvihz0B@AveDinero @SacramentoKings @NBA Good game buddy@SacramentoKings @swipathefox @buddyhield @hbarnes SUCKRAMENTO 🤣 https://t.co/TcxamzrUJIBuddy Hield linked up with Jeanie Buss during the Kings-Lakers game!

Let's not forget how quickly he signed Luke Walton like he's some kind of a good coach. The kings need to rebuild from the ground up.

How laughable is that@hlovann @PaulCho80755707 @SacramentoKings @swipathefox @buddyhield @hbarnes Just another ignorant play by @swipathefox It’s bad enough you don’t know the rules, but why would you want sideline out of bounds anyway?

Enjoy your race riots, L.A.! You willingly sold out the Lakers+Kings+Rams to Boston.@ConnorSully57 @Hooper_HotTakes @BombayBanta_ @SacramentoKings @mypmstore @russwest44 It happened at 2:43. Still able to challenge.@WorldWideWob This is what the Sacramento Kings do to a man@Realnewmoney818 @SacramentoKings @Lakers Queens would have lost even without that call@Avalanche @NHLBlackhawks @SacramentoKings @Lakers @espn interesting… https://t.co/PQjVxuvkeh@RuthlessEchoz @PaulCho80755707 @SacramentoKings @swipathefox @buddyhield @hbarnes that’s where the clock messed up bc fox never touched the ball so he never had possession of it that’s what the whole thing is. I’m not to sure abt it but That’s what I’m assuming. Even though the ball was infront of him lol.Lakers win 122-114 over the Sacramento Kings!! Monk and LeBron took over in the 4th quarter to help the Lakers win their 3rd game in a row, both of them finishing with 24 points and 31 points respectively. We move to a record of 20-19 with the Atlanta Hawks up next.@TheDukeOfSports @SacramentoKings @NBA Oh 100%…. But we both think they couldn’t have articulated a rule justifying the call lolPoverty franchise @SacramentoKings and it don’t help the @NBA don’t like us.@LeandrewEscobar @SacramentoKings @swipathefox @buddyhield @hbarnes Luka, Barnes, Halliburton, Buddy, Bagley… that would be interesting… and definitely better than this.@SacramentoKings @swipathefox @buddyhield @hbarnes I mean Haliburton didn’t do is part to help the team win is playmaking os fine but you got get your points up especially when you are 1 of the primary ball handles on the team mans was afraid to take shots at least get to the free throw lineThe Sacramento kings are so damn useless@tyjohn083 @Hooper_HotTakes @BombayBanta_ @SacramentoKings @mypmstore @russwest44 Oh facts. I don’t disagree. I’m just saying that play is not “challengeable”@BakesTakes1 @SacramentoKings @NBA The refs should’ve at least got in the mic and explained what happened@iab328 @John_Karalis Yeah just think whatever the rule says, the concept of possession was pretty obvious there. The Kings had it. The Lakers had retreated. Nobody had touched the ball only because Fox was asking for the clock to be checked first. Possession was clearly Sacramento’s.@SacramentoKings @swipathefox @buddyhield @hbarnes Alvin gentry has terrible rotations no Metu, didn’t he just hit a game winner. No Davis didn’t he play good defense on LBJ last game. Playing Len minute he’s not giving you much. Doug Christi should be the coach gentry is too old for this young group!!!FT.

 https://t.co/EJXsax8cevKings, in all likelihood, were not going to overcome a 5-point deficit in 24.8 seconds but I guess stranger has happened. Either way, turnovers (18) killed them as did the Lakers' grabbing 14 offensive rebounds for 18 second chance points. Little things doomed Sacramento.if yall watch the Kings - Lakers last minute, the Sacramento Kings tried so hard to make the Lakers cover 7.5. All their possessions were turnovers and even fouled the Lakers down 6 with 11 secs left. Thats a classic rigged game fellas. Watch the last min again. #nba #NBATwitter@Hooper_HotTakes @SacramentoKings @mypmstore @russwest44 Cough cough 2002 wcf@SacramentoKings y’all fuckin suck@Cranethagoat @SacramentoKings Got that good ref support just like 2002@MejiaDinero The explanation by the book is correct I guess but I’d think the refs are smart enough to know why the Kings didn’t grab the ball just to prove possession…Sacramento flashing back to referee calls vs LAL in 2001 playoffsIf you spend money on @SacramentoKings merchandise, tickets, etc you're supporting this absolute embarrassment of a basketball organization. #boycottthekings#NBA | FULL-TIME!:

It’s terrible to lose a game because of the Lakers paying people. #Game6wasFixed #sacramentokings @SacramentoKings @Lakers@SacramentoKings 
You can't have 18 turnovers and hope to win against LeBron. Too bad because we could have won this game with just a few mindful positions on the offensive end. 
@lockedonkingsThe Sacramento Kings had the cover! 🤣🤣🤣

That was a #BADBEAT 

I cant be mad tho.  Losing streaks be just like that sometimes. 🤣🤣#Los Angeles Lakers - Sacramento Kings ★ #Partido finalizado: 122 - 114 ★ by: #SofaScoreThat ref should be suspended!!!! @SacramentoKings 
#NBA lakers refs robbed us again @MattGeorgeSAC@SacramentoKings @swipathefox Trade himmm..... man.. its ridiculous how lose the ball in final minutes.. xhittt😡😡😡@KingJames told the @SacramentoKings bench 😂 https://t.co/LXlwLKWlfX&amp;&amp; lakers 💜🧡 win (122-114) vs Sacramento kings, they're now a game above .500 at (20-19), #Lake, #NBA75 , #NBATwitter , #MogatleMNudeEye 🏀😘Los Angeles defeat Sacramento with Lebron James proving that he was the only king on this court.

The veteran drops another 30+ points making it eight of his last nine games.

King James!

👑🏀

#NBA #LakeShow https://t.co/tqGInWd2F4Weird jump-ball call or not, the Kings failed to create stops down the stretch. 

LeBron did what he wanted, Westbrook got his chances late and Dwight Howard once again punished Sacramento.

Los Angeles straight up outplayed the Kings in the fourth. No other way to slice it.Sacramento Kings what a collapse, too many turnovers by Fox when it counts.And just like that the refs help the Lakers cover -6.5.

In case you Kings fans are wondering the ref was Brian Forte #45 who made sure your bet didn’t cash 👍

#LakersVsKings #losangeles #Sacramento https://t.co/uMa0rK0ACJ@SacramentoKings again !!! 4 points in last 3 mins of the 4th quarter. What a clown team, choked last mins of every quarter. 🤮😬5° Los Angeles Lakers 122 - 114 Sacramento Kings (NBA)@SacramentoKings @mypmstore post it cowards#NBA

https://t.co/NXzG0w4c5K@OfficialNBARefs lmao you idiots don’t even know the rules. Anybody who watched the @Lakers @SacramentoKings game just witnessed some stupid ass refs@DeadSOUL_25 @SacramentoKings @mypmstore Russ sold that fucking foul smhTBH that last possession should have gone to Sacramento kings rather than a jump ball. Dunno why the refs decided thatIt’s the Sacramento Kings. The End https://t.co/naffNQ92cp@MarcJSpears Why does shit like this only happen to the Sacramento Kings? It's like bullying someone with a disability.There's no way around it, the @SacramentoKings just don't care. The players, the coaches, and especially @Vivek #embarassmentGoodnight Queens @SacramentoKings 🥱 https://t.co/YgWNP0P9R1LAKERS WIN FILHA DA PUTANNNNNNNNN ME MAMA SACRAMENTO KINGSThe Lakers announcers are even saying the refs are making bullshit calls against the Sacramento Kings.. that's how u know it's bad... the Kings suck bad enough on their own, they don't need the refs helping lose.I have never seen what just happened in the final seconds of the Kings/Lakers game. Sacramento +8 all-time bad push https://t.co/FpAcNWlTn4You can make an argument that the Sacramento kings v Los Angeles Lakers may have involved players gambling.@SacramentoKings clearly got the rebound fox complain about the time. The refs blow the whistle and says jump ball. 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 #nba #Lakers #LakersNation #LALakersThis is a riveting performance from LeBron, the refs, and co. to just beat *checks notes* The Sacramento Kings.I know @SacramentoKings twitter had some slick shit to say if they won too! 😂@OfficialNBARefs @SacramentoKings @Lakers @NBATV wtf was the jump ball for?Everyone who is quite possibly mad about the recent jump ball in the Lakers vs Sacramento, it was because no one had possession of the ball during the stoppage of the game.

They didn’t take the ball from the Kings 🙄

#Kings #LakersCongratulations to Waltmester (@itsonlywalter) and DukeNukem who moved up to take #8 and #9 on the Sacramento Kings team leaderboard.

https://t.co/WHnq2718B3Sacramento was going to lose anyway, but @OfficialNBARefs absolutely blew any chance they had of coming back vs the #Lakers. LA misses a FT, #Kings get the clear rebound, the clock accidentally starts early, and refs say jump ball?! Lakers win jump and game over. Just a hose job.Lakers electric win over Sacramento Kings...

LeBron James takes over..5-baskets in span of 2-and-half minutes in come from behind win.  Malik Monk add 24-off bench

Lakers hit 15-of-18 shots late in game

18,000 plus fans lose their minds at the Crypt.The Sacramento kings are dog shit 😂😂😂The NBA just told y’all that y’all don’t matter @SacramentoKings@PaUlPoZ5 @SacramentoKings @BenSimmons25 Hell noHey @nba good job. You just said they you can have the home team “accidentally” have a clock malfunction and force a jump ball. @SacramentoKings fought hard. I’ll take it.What.The.Hell did the refs whistle in this @Lakers - @SacramentoKings game??? This is complete bs🤡This Lakers Vs kings game is fucking weird. What the fuck kind of call was that? #SacramentokingsSacramento Kings , he played tonight 😭😭 https://t.co/WPT7Z9GooT@SacramentoKings just got screwed.. How the hell was it a jump ball?! Refs need to get FINED for these dumbass calls!The #Lakers always find a way to cheat against the @SacramentoKings #NBA@OfficialNBARefs @SacramentoKings @Lakers @NBATV WTF TYPE OF CALL WAS THAT. REFS RIGGED THR GAME FOR THE LAKERSThought I was watching the @SacramentoKings vs Lakers game but turns out the refs decided we were playing Calvinball 🤡The Sacramento Kings are stupid and that is 1000% a jump ball. If no one has possession and the clock accidentally starts you can’t give one team the ball cause they closer. Either touch the ball to gain possession or take the call.@CrenshawCali @SacramentoKings @Lakers New offensive coordinator? https://t.co/DmOn0imz2U@MarcosBreton @SacramentoKings First round playoff play in preview.@Lakers y'all need a new ref replacement. @SacramentoKings  am I right?The absolutely random things happen to the Sacramento Kings on a nightly basis...@SacramentoKings @hoopculture13 Great defense at the end. You know, when it counted?Kings are dumb asf. Not fouling right away twice but then doesn't wanna touch the ball on a missed FT to save pennies worth of time.
Dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb
Y'all deserve that L @SacramentoKings grow some brain@VinoUncorked @SacramentoKings @Lakers Facts lolThe refs just making shit up to favor the Lakers and screw the Sacramento Kings #SACvsLAL even the lakers announcers and refs don't even know why they're calling what they're callingI’m a Lakers fan and what the refs just did to the Kings was absolutely criminal.  Way to fuel the conspiracy theories zebras.  😣 

#Lakers #LakersNation #SacramentoOkay what the hell just happened in the @Lakers vs @SacramentoKings game? Gentry was just losing it and from what the broadcasters are saying he had every right!!!The Sacramento Kings are a cursed franchise. Feel sorry for the fans.It's 2002 every year for the Sacramento Kings.@JfromBk @Lakers @SacramentoKings Like how tf did that turn into a jump ball?Quite possibly the worst NBA overturn call ever just happened in this Kings Lakers game. 

Kings completely got screwed with 25 seconds left. If I’m Sacramento I don’t even finish the game I walk off. What a joke!They just robbed the @SacramentoKings can u say rigged? 😅🤦‍♂️THE SACRAMENTO KINGS SCREWED THE SACRAMENTO KINGSWowwwww. Of course huh! @SacramentoKingsFuck the @nba and their fuckin refs.  Every time against the @SacramentoKingsThis is unacceptable behavior from Alvin Gentry!!! @SacramentoKings do you see this??? You must fire him immediately so he can learn his lesson on the @Lakers bench as punishment!!!Lakers are a protected species #lakeshow #kings #sacramentokings #sactown@nba @OfficialNBARefs what a joke of a call. call it a jump ball instead of kings ball cause they wanted to save some clock lol @SacramentoKingsAll that to barely be beating the @SacramentoKings.... https://t.co/ztItxnghm0@jr_xxi I too am a lifelong kings fan and agree to the trade I think it will turn our franchise (the Sacramento kings) around for the betterMVP for squeaking out a close win against the juggernaut sacramento kings 🔥 https://t.co/LETeyVj9l3Loved watching the @SacramentoKings &amp; @Lakers game tonight!

I agree in the sense that they both pass out of shots they should shoot, but they're 21 and 25. You give Hali the keys to the offence and watch him flourish.@GeeRodrigueeez @SacramentoKings I guess it just the mentality of the city and the love for the game from the fans. Also that underdog mentality to get finaly to the playoffs. Its just awesome even if the team does not play well.@SacramentoKings @ankr @TyHaliburton22 That's sick!@maxine_55 Miami Heat: 7th ranked defense

If he and Hali where together no one would drive the damn ball. Love Hali but some of the shit he does like passing when he should make a lay up is what Simmons does and it would just be a game of passing at the rim. Fox drives the ball, makes the plays@SacramentoKings @swipathefox @buddyhield @dameology Less turnovers and no easy offensive rebounds to them.I gave up Buddy's defense.
But Tyrese's defense needs to be improved now.
 For the @SacramentoKings future.

#NBA@NBATV @SacramentoKings Kings are still a top 5 franchise thoI need Sacramento Kings to win so this parlay can hit!@NBATV @SacramentoKings Fox putting on a show 🦊Sacramento leads the LAKERS 59-57 at the half. Talen Horton-Tucker and LeBron James both have 13 points to lead the way for us so far. The Kings hold a 28-23 lead on the glass. I want to see more of Dwight Howard in the 2nd half. 9:44 isn't enough for him in a half.Fox with the jumper to beat the first half buzzer. He has 19. 59-57 @Sacramentokings. Fox is only 1.3 points away from his seasonal average. LeBron/Horton-Tucker with 13 apiece for the Lake Show.I find the Sacramento Kings very intriguing from a roster standpoint because I like quite a few of their players. It just hasn't worked out. I'm sure teams will come calling about Harrison Barnes but I'm also not sure that they should move him..@SacramentoKings hold a slight edge at the break, 59-57 👀 https://t.co/rMyJ66zVCnHow the fuck are the Sacramento Kings winning this game#Los Angeles Lakers - Sacramento Kings ★ #2º cuarto terminado: 57 - 59 ★ by: #SofaScoreCheck out 2020 NBA Hoops Tyrese Halliburton ROOKIE CARD RC #238 RC Sacramento Kings https://t.co/RTcVbCBLG7 @eBay(LIVE) L.A.
