 https://t.co/EJXsax8cevKings, in all likelihood, were not going to overcome a 5-point deficit in 24.8 seconds but I guess stranger has happened. Either way, turnovers (18) killed them as did the Lakers' grabbing 14 offensive rebounds for 18 second chance points. Little things doomed Sacramento.if yall watch the Kings - Lakers last minute, the Sacramento Kings tried so hard to make the Lakers cover 7.5. All their possessions were turnovers and even fouled the Lakers down 6 with 11 secs left. Thats a classic rigged game fellas.

#NBA #LakeShow https://t.co/tqGInWd2F4Weird jump-ball call or not, the Kings failed to create stops down the stretch. 

LeBron did what he wanted, Westbrook got his chances late and Dwight Howard once again punished Sacramento.

Los Angeles straight up outplayed the Kings in the fourth. No other way to slice it.Sacramento Kings what a collapse, too many turnovers by Fox when it counts.And just like that the refs help the Lakers cover -6.5.

Fox is cooking, rather have Haliburton as the second option for now, maybe try a Hield, Mitchell, Bagley plus pick packageHoly shit i saw the Sacramento Kings pfp and i thought that shit was a nft for a second@RLGartist @Vice1904 @SacramentoKings @Verizon @swipathefox @TyHaliburton22 @hbarnes @MB3FIVE @dameology Simmons averaged 16ppg and hadnt shoot at all, it's all at the rim and he is extremely efficient there. I agree in the sense that they both pass out of shots they should shoot, but they're 21 and 25. You give Hali the keys to the offence and watch him flourish.@GeeRodrigueeez @SacramentoKings I guess it just the mentality of the city and the love for the game from the fans. Also that underdog mentality to get finaly to the playoffs. Its just awesome even if the team does not play well.@SacramentoKings @ankr @TyHaliburton22 That's sick!@maxine_55 Miami Heat: 7th ranked defense

If he and Hali where together no one would drive the damn ball. Love Hali but some of the shit he does like passing when he should make a lay up is what Simmons does and it would just be a game of passing at the rim. Fox drives the ball, makes the plays@SacramentoKings @swipathefox @buddyhield @dameology Less turnovers and no easy offensive rebounds to them.I gave up Buddy's defense.
But Tyrese's defense needs to be improved now.
 For the @SacramentoKings future.
