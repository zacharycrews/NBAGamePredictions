Not having to face Giannis, just an inexperienced Bucks. Surely they‚Äôd win‚Ä¶@dallasmavs @RealJasonKidd Playing Burke over Frank is foolish and not good for the future. Burke is a ball hog who can't defend or playmake. If you plan on being good in the future you're going to need defenders &amp; unselfish players like Frank around Luka. Develop the kid offensively.@dallasmavs @RealJasonKidd You're searching for offense that you don't have, team is not deep. Look at how Philly values Thybulle who isn't a good shooter.
