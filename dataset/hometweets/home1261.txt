Let Kd get some mid range catch and shoot shots or have him post up or let him set screens and fade to the open areas.

He can’t dribble against that @celtics Defense.I know there’s a big drama going on. This is just the beginning let’s do this Brooklyn Nets get into conference championship.

His long-term health is more important. Playing him too soon after his injury may risk getting reinjured or injure something else. 🙏Are you ready for this? 

Based on our survey, 67% believe that @BrooklynNets will win against the @celtics. (The survey was answered and submitted last April 17) 

Can BKN turn this series around starting tonight and move to the second round of the playoffs?

@MomentRanks @NBA https://t.co/oz9xVfl9WG@celtics @BrooklynNets @NBCSBoston @espn @985TheSportsHub Why is the interval between Celtics vs Nets games (3days) longer compared to other series (2 days)?It’s a safe bet Kyrie will quit on the @BrooklynNets , just like he did with @cavs , and just like he did with the @celtics… but, sadly, we have to drive to RI or CT to make that wager. #LetUsBet #BetOnMA #MApoli  #BetonMass https://t.co/TBSmyH1skc@celtics @BrooklynNets @NBCSBoston @espn @985TheSportsHub If we lose I’ll suck a dick@BrooklynNets Might as well play him bc Robert Williams is playing.Saturday best bets

KD and Kyrie it's now or never@CJAquaBurn That’s like saying Brooklyn nets for Kevin Durant’s grooming standards …@Isacale_ Torce pro Brooklyn Nets ai@demarvelousmvp Brooklyn netsI’ve seen to much negativity! Nets are coming back in this series I’m speaking it into existence 🗣 #PositiveVibes #Nets #NetsWorld #BrooklynNetsMy husband who trained with Brett Brown said @BrooklynNets need to hire him, he’s familiar with @BenSimmons25 &amp; @Patty_Mills + coached @KyrieIrving dad &amp; is a great technical, team coach. Udoka who Nets gave up as an assistant is a ninja level coach #NBAPlayoffs2022 #NetsLevel#NBAPlayoffs #KevinDurant #BrooklynNets Nets-Celts resume tomorrow - so far against Celts, only 38.5% of Durant's FGs have been assisted. That's his lowest FGs assisted % in playoffs since 2012-13, when he had to take the reins for Thunder due to Westbrook's torn meniscus....😳 https://t.co/BuYGXUCmNYStop playing one on one.
