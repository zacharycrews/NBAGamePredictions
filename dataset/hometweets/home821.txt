@trailblazers 26 points to tie Kareem, 27 to pass him. Chances are good to see the all time points record fall tonight.

I don’t believe @Dame_Lillard will play again this year. He’s had core muscle surgery &amp; the @trailblazers are retooling. Dame is not even supposed to be evaluated for another 2-4 weeks.@JorOverrated @Lakers @trailblazers WHY would Portland do that??@DOOM_______ @JorOverrated @Lakers @trailblazers Laker fans are so entitled. They think teams will make trades for the sole reason of improving the Lakers.@JorOverrated @Lakers @trailblazers put the damn pick in there too.@LiveBetGuy @_Brad_Schmidt @trailblazers If they had no other way of achieving that then sure put NAW on the floor and see what you have. Otherwise they are not outright looking to Audition for someone who they think might be 7-9 on their rotation.@RhythmNathan @whytefolks1 @trailblazers @joshhart What if Simons and Hart like, just gel and play like Michael and Scottie tonight?

We bench them. Both. Until next year. That’s what.

#tankcity@whytefolks1 @bjforsythe @trailblazers @joshhart Pels hate for Lakers

               🤝

Blazers hate for Lakers@LiveBetGuy @_Brad_Schmidt @trailblazers I’m not sure I follow. The Blazers are trying to clear as much cap space as possible while attaining as many picks so that this summer they can go after proven talent to go alongside Dame, Ant, and Nas. (1/2)@JorOverrated @Lakers @trailblazers Pleaaaasssseeeeee@RhythmNathan @whytefolks1 @trailblazers @joshhart I get it but I’m all done waiting for “potential” to be realized on this roster. Hope he does well. Let’s go get an established badass via trade with picks and cap space.@whytefolks1 @bjforsythe @trailblazers @joshhart Wait no they gotta win tonight! (If possible) For irony!@bjforsythe @RhythmNathan @trailblazers @joshhart 💯 I’m praying for no more wins all season 😂BREAKING NEWS:

Per @LRichardsonNBA, Russell Westbrook is OUT for tonight's game against the Portland Trail Blazers for Personal Reasons https://t.co/Z7uukY7DGu@bjforsythe @whytefolks1 @trailblazers @joshhart It’s a nothing burger consideration right now. But if NAW turns into Shai Blazers will regret it more than Pels (I think)@BlazerLegendSZN @trailblazers @joshhart depends on who we're able to land first. playing besides Lillard doesn't sound bad to any good player. if we can add more to the roster, then it becomes really attractive. We're WAY better now than in that sinking ship that was the team until last week@bjforsythe @trailblazers I’m as big of a homer as possible, even I know there isn’t a move out there we can make that would save this season anyway. I’m with your thinking here. Time to asset collect.@JorOverrated @Lakers @trailblazers That would never happen lolTrail Blazers Complete Trade with New Orleans https://t.co/PKLZ4Q82mq via @trailblazers Dumber by the day.I’m cool with the @trailblazers tanking this year because - as so many have pointed out - they cannot land a free agent to save our their franchise. Packaging a top 5 pick with their $21M trade exception may be the only way we get a player good enough to contend. #ripcity@trailblazers @joshhart Bledsoe is right next to him, and you wouldn't mention. 😀@BlazerLegendSZN @trailblazers @joshhart it's to open cap space. Ingles contract ends this year. We'll have a lot of money to sign someone good in free agency, this is the angle.@gb3elite @trailblazers Big game incoming@bjforsythe @whytefolks1 @trailblazers @joshhart Yeah the cap space play seems wild. But you gotta stick to it at this point. I was hoping they’d keep NAW but I get it@auraauraaura7 @maurice_mallari @JorOverrated @Lakers @trailblazers Tank mode doesn’t mean take on 15 million more a year for the next 2 years without getting a really good asset back as well.Wtf Mike McDaniels?

Here’s two guys that have been Massively underperforming this year for your franchise player. 😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣@koivrr @CompDepths @BlazerLegendSZN @trailblazers @joshhart Hes an expiring contract, they did the trade for elijah and a second round pick, not bad value for NAW who doesnt fit portland@bjforsythe @trailblazers @joshhart Hell yeah!@gothamtyler @jruhland21 @ripcityfan89 @AlterThe2nd @trailblazers @CJMcCollum Wait, isn’t that my point? If you keep McCollum, you can’t upgrade the front court (unless you trade Simons for a front court player).@JabAspie @_Brad_Schmidt @trailblazers So, again, why not take a flyer on NAW?@trailblazers @joshhart me exact reaction to the front office decisions year in and year out.@Andy13887227 @Matthew22061061 @JorOverrated @Lakers @trailblazers you just disrespected Bill Walton, Clyde Drexler, and Brandon Roy@GhettoWeekend @gothamtyler @jruhland21 @ripcityfan89 @AlterThe2nd @trailblazers @CJMcCollum My point is that if you’re committed to keeping this up and coming star that is Simons, you can’t keep McCollum. You can’t keep all 3 guards. And I’d personally absolutely pick Simons.@whytefolks1 @trailblazers @joshhart Have seen a few tweets just now that he is available to play tonight.

The @trailblazers are a shitty Team. they needed to reshape and rebuild. 2023@auraauraaura7 @maurice_mallari @JorOverrated @Lakers @trailblazers Rebuild includes freeing up cap space to make room for good signings next year. 

It doesn’t include filling up that cap space with an underperforming player that is the most hated player by the fan base. It doesn’t make sense in the slightestHey @trailblazers fans. This is where you want to be tonight!!!

My point was, for that share of the cap, is it worth seeing whether the guy can play?@marthapel @_Brad_Schmidt @trailblazers Blaming a separate entity for a problem they dodnt create. NBA doesn't pay WNBA players. Thats on the WNBA. NBA makes ~8 billion and Players assoc negotiated for the salaries. WNBA makes 60mil, while it shells out 70mil. Losing 10m/yr.

I don't think Dame stays if he isn't convinced they are trying to build a winner around him.Does @SacramentoKings realize that @trailblazers, @spurs, @okcthunder, &amp; @HoustonRockets are a much better roster then what they have now since trading away Haliburton?

This not adding up @trailblazers@BlazersArgento @trailblazers @joshhart @NickeilAW @satoransky @Didi Well.I can’t wait for @trailblazers ticket prices going up next year and everyone complaining.

Prepare to be disappointed.@AlvinNelson07 @maurice_mallari @JorOverrated @Lakers @trailblazers CJ had low value dame does notThe Portland Trail Blazers... so what's going on with all of that?@JorOverrated @Lakers @trailblazers Not only would they never trade for Westbrick. The trade would negatively hit the Blazers' cap. We're stuck with this Westbrick guy@Matthew22061061 @JorOverrated @Lakers @trailblazers Russ is washed, a report came out the other day that league execs all agree THT trade value is massively over valued. No way that trade would go through@justbeingbeans @trailblazers Earning their paychecks this week!Another HORRIBLE TRADE By The Portland Trail Blazers... https://t.co/16EpVb7UWw via @YouTubeWhat are the @trailblazers doing? I know they have cleared up cap room but trading cj and Norman Powell for 2nd round picks seems like a weird way to do it. Not to mention when has Portland been a FA destination? https://t.co/VIKHrvij8m@wintse84 @trailblazers @Dame_Lillard @AnferneeSimons @BenSimmons25 @JeramiGrant @bosnianbeast27 I think if @Dame_Lillard says he is good to ball with him, then you trust his skills and pull the trigger.@youareapussyas1 @Matthew22061061 @JorOverrated @Lakers @trailblazers Stars and value, not a horrible player with a young guy for a all star caliber player https://t.co/QCExhFDiiQ@trailblazers what is you doing baby?@BlumerBrandon @scottguedes @ImClique_ @wojespn @trailblazers They really traded 
Satoranski (10mil expiring contract) for (Ingles 13 mil expiring contract)
Then traded NAW for Hughes &amp; second round pick. 
I think they are building up picks to trade for Grant and/or other players they want to build around Dame.@maurice_mallari @JorOverrated @Lakers @trailblazers have you seen the trades Blazers have done? I can see them doing anything at this point 😂Hello @RipCityClothing!

I would like to speak to your manager about the purchase of a Joe Ingles Blazer jersey....

Thank you,

Getting another domino to have more more for the summer of 2022 NBA Free Agency. #NBAFormer Syracuse basketball star Elijah Hughes reportedly (H/T @wojespn) headed to Portland Trail Blazers in a three-team trade.

He had LeMarcus Aldridge with him, traded. Cj McCollum, traded. I can’t see no other way if they don’t bring some good players in Portland.
