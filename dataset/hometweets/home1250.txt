My point isn’t that Boston ain’t racist, the whole country is racist. But the Boston Celtics are not racist that’s a misguided narrative with nothing to stand onAACCNJ, John Harmon and M. L. Carr, former Boston Celtics Basketball Player, discussing our History in the US, and how we can help Black people and businesses. This was following a wealth seminar hosted by Truist Bank on April 14th at New York City 🏙 https://t.co/2s5q2un8bm@BradenWinkler @be_giannis @NBA @BrooklynNets @celtics @chicagobulls @Bucks You're literally a bandwagon and y'all literally have 0 rings@CarlyNevis No @celtics tonight, Carly?Who is the greatest Celtic ever?

@celticsGreat news @celtics fans. We no longer have to live in a world where @smart_MS3 has never been named DPOY! @KingChuddy shares why Boston loves and trusts Smart, why he's so deserving of this award, and why he is the heart and soul of the team.

The Brooklyn Nets were unable to tame a wild Jayson Tatum, his buzzer beater is what won it for the Celtics in game 1.

All in all, this was a close game ending in a point difference, 114-115
