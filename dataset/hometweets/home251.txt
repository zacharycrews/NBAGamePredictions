https://t.co/8ef0Uu9Lgl@esports_kobe @lolesports @AzaelOfficial @huhi @Licorice @warriors LETS GO DUBSSSS@DogSurfRoadshow @warriors @KlayThompson What doubters fail to realize is that this team that is already looking like the 2015-2016 Warriors are getting a KD like boost in Dec without losing their depth.@Trevor_Lane The golden state warriors- Kyrie Irving game-winning shot over Stephen Curry
- LeBron James chase-down block on Andre Iguodala
- Kevin Durant game-tying shot to force OT vs. Milwaukee
- Golden State Warriors win their 73th game of the season, setting all-time recordThis is a revenge tour for the Golden State Warriors.@warriors And Steph was basically the only threat. If Klay didn’t get injured, they can’t use it on Curry because the purpose is so that the defense doesn’t have to worry much about the other players to focus mainly on the star player. We have plenty of talent this season. It won’t work.@AzaelOfficial @lolesports @huhi @Licorice @esports_kobe @warriors @faker There better be a Raptors jersey under that sweater!Nba
LA Lakers -7.5

Phoenix Suns -7.5

Toronto Raptors vs. Golden State Warriors OVER 217@warriors Lemme try to explain how box and one works since ppl think the raptors will use it on curry tonight. Box and 1 is used usually when there is  1 offensive threat and everyone else isn’t that good. It was effective in the that finals series because they could focus on Steph.Games Batum will likely miss: 
vs @dallasmavs 
vs @DetroitPistons 
vs @warriors 
vs @PelicansNBA 
vs @SacramentoKings 

And the next being against the @Lakers. Clippers should still beat the Kings/Pelicans/Pistons but nothing is guaranteed. Going to need Nico soonThe GREATNESS that is my childhood  basketball sports hero Sleepy Floyd! He was recently on The @RickBarryShow with myself and Hall of Famer @Rick24Barry (tweet’s pinned, truly amazing show) and told us his son who lives in SF is representing him at tonight’s @warriors game. https://t.co/KXVkbA0Fne@RaiderZemag @trentsznn @statmuse @warriors @WarriorsPR @KlayThompson @StephenCurry30 @Money23Green Bro nobody?warriors has to play 96 bulls or 92 dream team or something??@AzaelOfficial @lolesports @huhi @Licorice @esports_kobe @warriors @faker he is probably speechless (hence not replying)Raiders and Cowboys both playing like trash.

Box and 1 isn’t as effective if you have a whole squad…@warriors @KlayThompson rest of the league when Klay Thompson come back.  https://t.co/deSuFXqsaTJaqen H'ghar scored 2 rebounds against the Warriors of Golden State. Lord Commander Tyrion Lannister pronounced "this has turned into a defensive battle"@solecalifornias @kokoyhez @TorontoDame @warriors U do realize they used a box and 1 because Klay and Durant were out… The reason they used that strategy is because Curry was the only offensive threat after Klay got injured. They have Poole, Wiggins, Belly, Lee, Moody, and more now. Learn your basketball before you talk.@brownbomber32 @Zuka91729997 @Raptors___Fan @nosides_ @statmuse @StephenCurry30 @warriors @WarriorsPR Obviously 😂 There’s bron fans out there who say he’s the best if u can readThe @warriors don’t need a trade because they’re acquiring one of the game’s all time greats @KlayThompson soon! https://t.co/5jnRXEKRldAhead of @warriors v @Raptors , take a look back at the Dubs win over the @DetroitPistons minus Steph Curry and Draymond Green 👇

I use 4 key stats in my model for each team when forming my lines.

For example when you see:

"Book Line Top
Predicted Line Bottom

Golden State v Dallas

S: GS Warriors -5
S: Dallas +5"

It suggests Dallas cover the spread. Same with TotalsToronto Raptors @ Golden State Warriors
Pick : Golden State Warriors.
