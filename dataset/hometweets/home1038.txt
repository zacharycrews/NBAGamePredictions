Bet slip link: https://t.co/sJlZ93lr3s https://t.co/avsWCxbHJCthe san antonio spurs play basketball laterSad I won‚Äôt get to see @AEW tonight at the Freeman Coliseum in San Antonio. Spurs are playing next door at the AT&amp;T Center, so I have to work. 
Also sad I didn‚Äôt get a picture with @thunderrosa22 on Monday at the Spurs game. I didn‚Äôt want to disturb her, but man, I‚Äôm a fan.That leaves the Spurs in a favorable spot to cover despite a modest record of their own. San Antonio has laid double digits just once this season: when it dismantled the¬†Pistons¬†by 35 points as a 10-point favorite.

Pick:¬†Spurs -13.5We back. Huge slate tonight and my first play probably is a fade. I like OKC tonight with the points in San Antonio. OKC not great against the spread as of late but neither are the Spurs. Shai is questionable, but 13.5 is a lot of points. Take OKC.Spurs' Jakob Poeltl recently tested his skills in the virtual gaming world when he made a trip to Port San Antonio for some "Call of Duty Warzone." https://t.co/6K43FN93MDGAMEDAY!!! SGA is questionable for tonight's game at San Antonio with an ankle injury.. @okcthunder start a 3-game road trip tonight in San Antonio to play the Spurs at 7:30 pm CT on Bally Sports Oklahoma...
