Pistons are 1-4 ATS in the last 5 meetings in Charlotte
Pistons are 2-7 ATS in the last 9 meetings
Under is 10-1-1 in the last 12 meetings
Hornets are 9-1 ATS in their last 10 home games@Eternity9 @hornets Bouknight is SO GOOD - what a shame we can’t see how he fits with LaMelo 😭Take the blinders &amp; earmuffs off @hornets front office, Coach JB, local media &amp; some “fans.” #allfly #FACTS #CallitOut #LaMelo #MalikMonk #JamesBouknight https://t.co/RKBNjpVkVJThis is apparently what the @hornets organization does with young talent. Perhaps on purpose. Making them feel less confident and devalued. This is a crime against the culture of hoops. https://t.co/FprfWgBeNGJust Drafted to the #TeamCSG lineup is this dazzling 2020-2021 Donruss Optic Pink Velocity Rated Rookie LaMelo Ball card graded a CSG 9.5.  The second-year Charlotte Hornets star is one of only two NBA players this season to lead his team in scoring, rebounds, assists and steals! https://t.co/dd1ZXcmSKTSponsorship Jobs Spotlight ✍️🤝

#AllFly https://t.co/CrLIQlYTPhThe Hornets have played 38 games this season. They have closed as a favorite only eight times, going 7-1 SU and 6-2 ATS when laying points. Charlotte is -10 vs. Detroit tonight.Y’all should pick up Bol Bol, Jaxson Hayes, and Myles Turner @hornets@KingJosiah54 normally, I agree with your memes. As a Hornets fan, we wisehed and prayed for Malik Monk to be great (we obviously need the help). Malik never played to his potential in Charlotte. In LA, he doesn’t need to be a star, just a role player.@IrchamImawan @Pajita06 @hornets He cant coachingIm in Charlotte and thinking about going to the Hornets Pistons game.... Is it worth it?

#Pistons@hornets
The hornets are too inconsistent for a playoff push. They’ve been playing a very slow pace game lately and been losing more &amp; more. Their rotations are very horrendous as well resulting in player inconsistencies. Who do we blame?Orlando Magic - Philadelphia 76ers
Charlotte Hornets - Detroit Pistons
Indiana Pacers - Brooklyn Nets
Boston Celtics - San Antonio Spurs

Its about firing the coach because fire the coach. JB only takes Lamelo out when he's making repeated obvious mistakes and not allowing him to continue doing that crap. That's what a coach SHOULD DO.@iAm_Kpo @hornets @hornets run it backLamelo Ball Charlotte Hornets REBUILD!

He says that when Monk fell into an inconsistent role with the Hornets he wondered what the Lakers could do to snatch him from Charlotte.Grizz will catch the Pistons on the second night of a back to back as they’re in Charlotte tomorrow night to take on the Hornets.@amabanckou @TheAthleticNBA @jovanbuha @hornets @KingJames Because they have two better and a highly ranked prospect in the wings.Back-to-back @Bucks games this weekend on @TV5manila!

Vs @BrooklynNets on Saturday; Vs @hornets on Sunday.@TheAthleticNBA @jovanbuha And the @hornets didn’t extend him? That’s why @KingJames is the GOAT…isaiah Thomas said Monk is with an organization that believes in him now through his ups an downs.  this guy is starting for the Lakers an Charlotte let him walk for nothing.. fckn hornets ruin lottery picksI’ve always liked Malik Monk even when he was in charlotte hornets .Congratulations to lakeandland who moved up 95 spots to take #52 on the Charlotte Hornets team leaderboard.

So I should be asking you that question.@SuperfanHornets @hornets Hey can you be quiet please? Thanks@aumore5 @SuperfanHornets @hornets Bruh by that time James borrego will have ruined his career the better option is for them to trade him this season b4 the deadlineJames borrego is filled with jealousy he doesn’t want lamelo ball and miles bridges to be all stars because he wants to be the main focus of the charlotte hornet teamHornets Announce Partnership with YMCA of Greater Charlotte https://t.co/SVCjEGGHMa@hornets Still pissed beyond words the Hornets passed on  him. Had him right there in their hands....PISSED!!!! https://t.co/NseAxFEXG2@Ikeyburner @LaRocca504 To each his own, the name is not for everybody. My take is, if they made NOLA give Charlotte the Hornets name back then Utah should have given up the Jazz.@banslovesmom @SuperfanHornets @hornets Melo Will leave in year 4 or hornets trade him@banslovesmom @SuperfanHornets @hornets Hornets give borrego and rozier extension lol@iamstreako Nah defo not, bringing KPJ in takes the ball out of Melos hands and we’ve all seen that’s when this Hornets teams are at their best! I love KPJ but don’t like him in Charlotte@kirbswerve @CrownClubCLT @hornets It’s going to be fun!!!@aumore5 @SuperfanHornets @hornets Trading Melo will affect the franchise massively so fireinv borrego and trading Hayward and terry are the only wayDevonte Graham cooking with the pelicans. Happy for the guy. Wish we kept him in Charlotte, our 3 guard lineup was fuego. 🔥 #Hornets #AllFly"Rick Bonnell already trying to spin a negative narrative about the Hornets 40 games into …"

 #charlottehornets #kingdomhearts #diamond #elespectador #eltiempo https://t.co/cqFUmZ7NVK@assets_nba @hornets Locked him after one year? That would completely asinine! You need to have at least 2 years to make sure it wasn’t a fluke. I can’t stand MJ as an owner but he will not let this kid leave. It’s the only thing that makes him look like he’s done something right in the draft@hornets when are we going to make the move? https://t.co/om0ooDh227Charlotte hornets game on my bday? 🤔🤔@BleacherReport Future Charlotte HornetCheck out Charlotte Hornets InsertsParallel Lot https://t.co/Ijl2aZJY05 @eBay@Italiag777 @hornets Of course they can lol.

To be able to watch @Canes and @hornets games in spite of @YouTubeTVIngram to Charlotte:

While the Hornets could really use a capable center, they’re best targeting other options at this range in the draft. Ingram is a lengthy wing who can score in a variety of ways, and projects to be one of the better playmakers at his size relatively quickly.For real though! When we were in Charlotte and the hornets and kings played I didn’t realize until after the game 🤣 https://t.co/o4TV7JuSrw@Garytom68160723 @HornetsPR @hornets Ball lazy bc if he plays good he gets taken out bro 😭 he’ll be gone soon.@WilliePStyle dropped by the @ClubhouseKB with @KyleBaileyClub today as he broke down the biggest 
concerns for the @hornets after 2 tough losses, and how big it was for Matt Rhule to publicly admit the failure with the OL for the Panthers.
