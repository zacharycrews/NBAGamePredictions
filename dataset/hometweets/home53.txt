🇺🇸 UTAH JAZZ x DENVER

🏀 Rudy Gobert +12.5 rebotes @ 1.83 https://t.co/J2uchkABC5📅 On this day in 1984, John Stockton had five assists in his NBA debut with the @utahjazz.

Stockton would end his career with 15,806 assists, by far the most in NBA history.

There have been nine 1,000-assist seasons in NBA history. Stockton is responsible for seven of them. https://t.co/fb0tz03niYThe @nuggets  no longer have Jerami Grant, Torrey Craig or Mason Plumlee. The @utahjazz  had back Bojan Bogdanovic, who missed the playoffs due to wrist surgery. He was the X-factor in this contest, hitting five 3-pointers and scoring 17

https://t.co/GHiKg2YuK6@TermineRadio I’m confused. Was Lebron and Melo the only two in the Banana boat? Doesn’t Wade have ownership stake in the Utah Jazz? But I get it, it’s Lebron. https://t.co/XIu5soK9q3NBA Day 8️⃣ 🏀🏀🏀

They sure aren’t. They are a barometer of how teams are playing right now though. And they ain’t it.@DwitjustinGilas @NBATV @utahjazz Maybe you didn’t see what they did in the off-season.  Will be different this year for sure.@utahjazz @spidadmitchell You all are getting some bonus points. 😆@utahjazz @slcstars It was a really stupid pick tbhWith their defeat of the @Raptors last night, the @chicagobulls reached the 4-0 mark faster than anyone. The @warriors and @utahjazz are right behind at 2-0, while the @DetroitPistons and @okcthunder remain winless. #NBA #BackSportsPage  https://t.co/a1dJHBLZgS https://t.co/lKffu1jusT@73MilitaryMama @Joeingles7 @utahjazz Lamb.

Been a fan since the And1 days. Been showing your YT videos to my young ballers. Great meeting you at the Utah Jazz party. My brother is part of the Udo company.@utahjazz This is terrific, congratulations @Dre_Williams12!!! 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼Bulls are going to be that NBA team that's way better than bad teams 

But not good enough to regularly win against quality teams.

Yet they'll finish like 4/5 in the east and get "dark horse" contender talk.

Basically, they are the 2017/18 Utah Jazz.Just wait until they face my utah jazz team. https://t.co/E63P49MxP6Check out Mitchell &amp; Ness 1993 NBA All Star Utah Michael Jordan Chicago Bulls Hat  #MitchellNess https://t.co/iz2Qy504ep via @eBay #jordan1 #jordan5 #nikedunks #jordan4 #jordan #offwhite #chicagobulls #michaeljordan #nba   #nbadraft #utah #utahjazz #saltlakecity #jazz #goatCongrats to CALS alum @Dre_Williams12 on the move to the @utahjazz https://t.co/F20q992hZV@NBATV @utahjazz Yeah, the NBA world so worried about gobert puting 10/10 against zubac in playoffsAll Utah Jazz are now ready to throw hands with Campazzo.

Nuggets have to play Utah jazz tomorrowEARLY SEASON HOT TAKE: 

Eastern Conference Finals matchup:

Miami Heat Vs Milwaukee Bucks

Western Conference Finals Matchup:

Los Angeles Lakers Vs Utah Jazz

Finals Matchup:

Lakers Vs Bucks@utahjazz @slcstars Man, are we ever gonna see him play rotations during the regular season??@NBATV @utahjazz Bucks and Nets??? Bulls have a better record than them@utahjazz Surely, he’s getting close 🙏🏼I know I’ve said this, but I really like this Bulls team. I feel like they are essentially the Utah Jazz of the EastWent from no respect, to all the respect! @utahjazz https://t.co/ok2It2mpd2He struggles accepting that the @utahjazz won this game and MANY others. By the looks of these replies you'd think Donovan Mitchell had a terrible game when he put up 27 points, Rudy Gobert had 17 with 20 rebounds &amp; we won 110 Jazz 101 Kings. 😏 And we lost Joe Ingles early. https://t.co/osI0jbPYLP
