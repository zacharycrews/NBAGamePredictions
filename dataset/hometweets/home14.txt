How will Miami match-up? My guess:
Giannis - Bam
Khris - PJ
Pat - Jimmy
Grayson - Dunc
Hill - Kyle

Will Miami play small (less Dedmon) off the bench with Kieff or PJ at 5 or force Bucks to defend size? https://t.co/SQGWnkoLCh@Kalebmallory @LastOfDaReal94_ @NBA @MiamiHEAT watchnbastreams .comMiami Heat basketball starts tonight! 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥WE BACK!! @MiamiHEAT #HeatCulture https://t.co/wErJDnC0tb@MedicalMewtwo @miamiguydylan @samgolub3 @H_0CKEY FAU is on the road.

Perfect let down spot for the Bucks after they had their big emotional win on opening night. Complete line flip makes me like the Heat even more.Lastly, this year the Miami Heat need to increase their pace. For the past few years, Miami has stood out as a defense first organization that loves players who have that "dog". Nothing has changed this year with the acquisitions that have been made but what about the buckets?@Pedro7007 @MiamiHEAT LETS GO HEAAAAAAAAAAT 🔥🔥🔥🔥Picks in @Broncos vs @Browns, @Braves vs @Dodgers, @dallasmavs vs @ATLHawks, @Bucks vs @MiamiHEAT, @LAClippers vs @warriors, @NCAAFootball &amp; @NHL. A winning parlay that pays $900 for $50. $90 for the parlay, $125 for all of my picks today, or $500 for 5 picks a day for a month.The Miami Heat will play their first regular season game tonight, but they've already bestowed the impending era with Kyle Lowry as the new franchise point guard with a catchphrase.

They’re calling it “Kyle Chaos."

#NBAPicks #NBATwitterLive https://t.co/1oAObQrl73@MiamiHEAT Don’t talk to the @MiamiDolphins we on a punishment go @MiamiHEATToday the Miami Heat begin the 2021/2022 NBA season and I couldn't be more excited. I believe they will be a top three team in the East this year and should be considered a dark horse favorite. In order for the Heat to be successful, I believe three major things need to happen.@MiamiDolphins @MiamiHEAT I'd rather you guys become a respectable franchise again by starting to win again and to also stop being linked to trading for a QB who has multiple pending sexual assault allegations and likes his butthole played with my massage therapists, but that's just me.@SvmR6 @Herrojuku From this Bucks fan, nothing but love for the Heat. Take care of our boy PJ, you guys got a monster. And honestly, you guys worry me more come playoff time that the Nets. They ain't DAWGS like we got in Milwaukee and Miami!!@MiamiDolphins @MiamiHEAT but it's y'all who need the luck😔@OutTheMuj why are the Heat favorited?

Miami +2.5 (2U)
Miami M/L +120 (1U)

Bucks looked great in opener. However still down 2 rotation guys and Portis left w/ heel issue. He may play. Miami is fully healthy w/ Lowery.  Like this spot for the Heat.

Mark my words https://t.co/7wnRKrnEHgOn my “do not bet on” list:

Anthony Davis - can’t be trusted whatsoever with your money 

Miami Heat - whatever you bet on to happen, the opposite will happen

I don’t even waste my time with trash teams, never know what to expect with them. Unless you catch a line finesse https://t.co/LmmFqJ0vTujames jones miami heat legend@TheHoopCentral As an honest celtics fan, I believe we should trade Jaylen Brown to the Miami Heat for Max Strus. Strus is a sniper from 3 meanwhile Jaylen not so much.15 strong #Miamiheat https://t.co/iB0BFl9SjRTHE MIAMI HEAT PLAY TOMORROW https://t.co/5EBGhH6TWJ1 more sleep 😴 @MiamiHEAT #heatnation #letsgoheat #HEATTwitter 🔥 🏀Miami heat play tomorrow.@MiamiHEAT 🔥🔥🔥🔥they not ready.Real ball 🚲 tomorrow tho @MiamiHEATBUT with NBA back in season tomorrow is the big day MIAMI HEAT BASKETBALL IS BACK BABY@knicks_post The Ray Allen 3 in Miami is up there too even tho I was rooting against the heatBasketball.

Everything I’ve read and seen, Milwaukee expects him to take a huge step. 

With DiVincenzo out, Miami’s gonna have to take Nwora into account this game. 15 and 6 last night vs the Nets.

He can be an X-factor tomorrow night. https://t.co/2Lmsg5KHLv@Alberticoo21 @MiamiHEAT I see her and I see a mix of your mom and grandma!I can’t wait for ya boys to play tomorrow @MiamiHEAT@MiamiHEAT Siiiick 🥶I can’t wait for @MiamiHEAT tomorrow@isiah_nba @MiamiHEAT Can't believe this dude was available for free late last season@MiamiHEAT Wow what a fucking magnificent choice@MccantJustin @SilverTJC @MiamiHEAT FOR YOUR MIIIIIIAAMMMMIIII HEEEEEAAAATT@MiamiHEAT Top tier dade countyThe Pacers spiraling harder than the January-February 2021 Miami Heat@MiamiHEAT Love this.@BamericaSZN @MiamiHEAT i didn’t know this existed ur my saviorJust wait till @MiamiHEAT plays 🔥🔥🔥@BamericaSZN @asvpxclippy @MiamiHEAT LinkSeeing Basketball tweets not related to the Miami Heat &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;@BamericaSZN @MiamiHEAT HOW DID YOU WHAG IS THIS@Alberticoo21 @MiamiHEAT Congrats Brodie!!!@MiamiHEAT This just got me hypedThis year's Miami Heat is going to be so special to watch #BasketballTown https://t.co/YV6AHG0eGkThat Miami Heat intro video has me hyped up enough to run through a wall like Kool Aid man. https://t.co/NRaN3Jiazr@MiamiHEAT Tomorrow We Move!!
