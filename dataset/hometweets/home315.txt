Second and more importantly in this scnerio it helps the nets clear@up their salary cap a bit… mainly the fact that they were trying to sign Durant, kyrie AND dreandre(obvious a bad move in hindsight) https://t.co/MGPFPNLN5b@cooliworldpeace @NBAonTNT @warriors @Suns You went and searched all this up and couldn’t look for proper answers on why teams use sign and trade’s and which circumstances it’s used in?

Very soon they'll start comparing him to Doncic, Tatum and Trae Young.

https://t.co/YE2EWg8lXzI find it hilarious that the Detroit Pistons have a beat writer assigned to them by @TheAthletic, but the reigning Western Conference Champs @Suns don't.

When we’re playing our style and on we can put work any team. Defense will need to be at a really high level though. It’ll be a battle for sure. Go Suns!!If the Suns are to get this W it really boils down to 3 things to me

1. Chris &amp; Devin are going to have make some tough shots in 1 on 1 situations

2. Ayton is going to have win matchups when GS switches smalls onto him

3. Phoenix has to get out and run off of TOs and missesBig time basketball tonight with @Suns @warriors . Getting the mojo going before the new year no lessDubs Suns Tonight let’s get it Babyyyyyyy @Suns @warriors PRIME  TIME @StephenCurry30 @DevinBook gonna put on a show for usIn the 4th q of Nets/Suns, the Nets opted to play without a C the whole quarter.

They ended up winning that period 35-23. Now Phoenix may have took their foot off the gas but they were stalled out very frequently.

Wonder if the Warriors smaller lineups present that same issue? https://t.co/uH8NVOpLWJHow in the world did the cheapest @Suns tickets go from $59 a couple of days ago to now $149? So ridiculous.@SportsCenter The Phoenix Suns will put  stop to them.This is the 6th time in NBA history two teams with a winning percentage of .850 or better are facing off at least 20 games into the season.

I listen to a lot of National sports talk and I don’t understand that AT ALL.. but when the best teams in hoops are talked about the Suns have made that convo every time. And rightly so..I have never seen this type of disrespect @espn is giving the @AZCardinals and the @Suns both playing at a ridiculous level and are still being ignored by the national media. It’s sad when journalists don’t even acknowledge Fact over popularity.@TheHoopCentral @Pacers are going nowhere. Sabonis deserves much better. How about a trade to @Suns? The final piece for Phoenix is a premier PF like Sabonis.@NBCSports @Suns Stephen Curry and the warriors are on fire right now so at the moment I am going to have to go with the warriors as the best team. The warriors will play the suns tomorrow though, so we will see how that goes.It's unacceptable that I have to switch to DirecTV or Cox to watch the hometown @Suns. I can't even watch them when they are on NBATV because they black it out here in Phoenix. Nobody wants a cable box or a satellite anymore.
