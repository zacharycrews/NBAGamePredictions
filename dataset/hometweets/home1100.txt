  #betting #Basketball #Atlanta #Hawks #Golden #State #Warriors@Rparksjr85 @ATLHawks @FortyEightMins The thing is though Brooklyn will likely play Toronto in the play-in. The winner of the No. 8 vs. No. 7 gets the No. 7 spot in the playoffs for seeding. It’s in Miami’s best interest to stay the course at the top of the East@shyam_fanalyst @ATLHawks @FortyEightMins I’m thinking the Heat want to slip down to that number 2 spot. Because I’m sure they would rather play Toronto than.

The Bulls are DONE. There is no sense of urgency with this team. They are getting hammered by a 30-42 team that looks hungry, wants it more. The Bulls look like they want to be playing golf!@Dom_2k Just constantly the 2015 Atlanta Hawks season after season.@ATLHawks @SharifeCooper who's not?@AugustaJags @ATLHawks Acknowledge this.

Such an amazing stat. NBA is the greatest league ever. 14 points in a quarter? Wow!! Amazing! Wonder what he’d score if they didn’t play defense.@MikeBellATL @ATLHawks @solohill Is Zion a good fit? There has been a lot of talk this year that seems to point to Zion not being a good teammate.College Park Skyhawks plays that way..The Atlanta Hawks doesn't. Ya'll gotta watch them more even when JJ and Cooper aren't playing https://t.co/ZtZq1DscqhWho’s ready? @AtlantaFX https://t.co/3jbvKQ4JLp@scottnoah07 @JCamero28858912 @onlytaron I would rather finals appearances that mean something. Going through a loaded west for my entire career instead of the weakest east in the history of mankind.  Beating the Toronto Raptors and the Atlanta hawks To go to the finals aint much@TraeFor3 @ATLHawks @TheTraeYoung @Jalen_J23 He needs to learn how to play defense…he looked like a matador out there…nice offense but that defense will keep him riding the pine…which won’t help him learn but it’s crunch time now…that is former atlanta hawks assistant eric musselman https://t.co/SBk8MTVkzf@putemupcdukes @MikeBellATL @ATLHawks @solohill @DukesandBell929 Big man with bad feet…plus an attitude….defense sketchy…all for another $170+ mil next year …hard pass…we could get two good 3 and D players hopefully a professional veteran type or Jaylen Brown😜Boot was wearing some Atlanta Hawks mesh shorts with no underwear and the usher let them both in without tickets!I heard a story that Boot Buttrey showed up at the Fieldhouse with Eric Musselman back in early 2000s to watch Fairless in a playoff game. He didn’t have tickets &amp; told the guy at the door he was a scout with the Atlanta Hawks &amp; was there to see Jerry Prestier!@putemupcdukes @Clete27 @MikeBellATL @ATLHawks @solohill @DukesandBell929 Not in the NBA…NFL yeah…NBA nope!@MikeBellATL @ATLHawks @solohill I rather them get someone like Karl Anthony Towns, Zion is injury prone and a bit out of shape.Don’t miss the REMIX!!!
