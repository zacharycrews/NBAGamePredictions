@dallasmavs @luka7doncic This draft selection is funny as heck. Both Cap not choosing one player. 😂🤣😂🤣

Happy that Giannis Jokic LeBron Steph is playing again with Luka. Plus I could see what could have been if the Dallas office is not such an ass building on a team. DeMar and Luka.@vubus @Zeraxc @dick_nowitzki @dallasmavs @luka7doncic he better fail 🙏🙏🙏Now that we’ve had a few hours to decompress. How are we feeling @dallasmavs nation?@dallasmavs @ModeloUSA So we can all agree that Cuban is a bottom 5 owner in the league now, right? Better hope Dirk’s loyalty rubbed off on Luka or he’s gone as soon as he can force a trade or becomes a free agent@Sierraztx @LAClippers @dallasmavs @BallySportWest @AM570LASports @TuLigaRadio @AguaCalientePS Exactly…Both of them have no shooting from the outside..defense will clog the laneI s2g if the Dallas Mavericks don’t play Boban now that KP is gone and we don’t have a center, I’m gonna lose my mind. 😩😩

#mffl@dallasmavs @ModeloUSA Lol Dwight Powell still here 🤦🏻‍♂️@dallasmavs @ModeloUSA Shame 💔This Porzingis trade feels like it will come back to bite the Dallas Mavericks.

He is shooting 58% on corner 3s. If used properly he will provide a great spacing option around Luka.@LiamH_14 @nRoxx27 @dallasmavs @ModeloUSA Dude don’t get my hopes up@Owen74742700 @dallasmavs @ModeloUSA KP protecting the rim https://t.co/HrlHy6nvWhFirst time an amazing duo was ruined, it was the @dallasmavs fault.

It's a win in my bookYES. Love this trade. Porzingis never lived up to the hype and now we have a dynamic guard to complement Luka as well as keeping the offense rolling high octane when Luka is off the floor.

Not like that helps much when the Mavericks 1st round pick is owed to the Knicks (and is protected for years), making them handicapped@dallasmavs got better.  PeriodT.@iamelf @dallasmavs That cap room for 23/24 is eye opening. Getting off the KP contract is huge.@jz62980 @dallasmavs KP not getting rebounds from the bench. When he played this year he was good but can’t count on him. Mavs have been playing great basketball last couple weeks without him.

Bertans here for shooting not rebounds@iamelf @dallasmavs He’s about to get that money Elf!@dallasmavs You are the biggest embarrassment of all time. Nothing about this trade makes sense, literally nothing. Every way I’ve tried thinking about it doesn’t make sense. One of the biggest L trades in our history.

Dinwiddie and Bertans!! 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣DALLAS (AP) — The Dallas Mavericks are sending Kristaps Porzingis to the Washington Wizards for Spencer Dinwiddie and Davis Bertans, a person with knowledge of the trade said Thursday. https://t.co/4yRvXP5Kj3Expected the @dallasmavs to get a lot more in return by trading KP man.

Marvin Bagley and Buddy Hield would’ve definitely been a lot better. Basically a big who had no interest at one point playing in SAC and a solid three point SG.

Smh, just hope this doesn’t backfire.@mcuban thought Dinwiddie is some new crypto currency?? @dallasmavs #NBATradeDeadline@MavsStan41 @kporzee I’m really gonna miss the bro. Everyone was hyped when he came to Dallas and everyone thought they were title contenders but the bro was not healthy and had a huge contract on top of it. All the @dallasmavs need now is a decent center. Otherwise it’s first round exit #MFFLSEE BELOW 

Why did the Mavericks make this trade with the Wizards?

The loser here is Spencer Dinwiddie who joins a crowded backcourt with a ball dominant Luka in town@kporzee @dallasmavs I'll miss seeing this duo 😭❤️ https://t.co/DQr0XIVrXZThere’s two things about this @kporzee trade. The good is we can have a player that is consistently healthy. The negative we don’t have a good big man, which means we’re gonna get torched in the paint. @dallasmavs #MFFLThe Dallas Mavericks are trading Luka Dončić to the Lakers for Kendrick Nunn and a heavily protected 2028 2nd-round pick, league sources tell ESPN.Really digging @dallasmavs trade. KP could never stay healthy and I’ve always been fan of Dinwiddie. Believe he can be  great opposite Doncic. Bertans when healthy is a sniper from beyond arc. Plus, Mavs are terrible in draft so giving away 2nd round pick is nothing@dallasmavs we have to rim protection  fuck uThe Mavericks trade away Prozingis 🚨 

Dallas are sending the center and Davis Bertans to the Wizards, in exchange for Spencer Dinwiddie and 2nd rnd pick!

#dallasmavericks #washingtonwizards https://t.co/7nOYF8hX6y@dallasmavs WHAT IS THAT?!?!I have officially given up hope for the @dallasmavs! Cuban is finding ways to waste Luka’s career in Dallas. SMH 🤦🏻‍♂️@dallasmavs wtf is going onthe whole dallas mavericks front office is not seeing heaven #MFFL #NBATradeDeadline@MKlebao The Dallas "Run it back" Mavericks.The Dallas Mavericks have traded Kristaps Porzingis to the Wizards for Spencer Dinwiddie and Davis Bertans. #Mavs #Wizards https://t.co/dBz2G1PjOIThis is a Dallas Mavericks Hate Account nowJust like that he gone?? Really?? @dallasmavs https://t.co/0Bm5cIKi5x@mcuban @dallasmavs explain this trade to me like I’m 5. We traded our second best player in order to put a worse team on the floor, one less draft pick, and picking up larger contracts. What part am I missing????Last two days really I been hoping and praying the @dallasmavs made ANY kind move by the #tradedeadline and now that they have…instant regret how are the #MAVS the ones getting fleeced here #MFFL but got damnWTF？？？How about Porzingis'knee？
Why's  Dwd？
@dallasmavsHow is that y’all find a way to fumble a bag in almost every trade?? @dallasmavs@jakecruzen41 @dallasmavs @mcuban Just trying to make Luka do it alone like he did Dirk@thisdamnbirdapp @FranmilsEyebrow @cavs @dallasmavs No, it is traded.  It was part of the LeVert deal. It has not conveyed. It is protected for 1-14 for 2022 and 1-14 for 2023. Turns into two 2nd rounders if it doesn't convey by 2023. In order to trade any pick prior to 2025 RIGHT NOW they would have to remove the protection.BREAKING: The Atlanta Hawks are sending John Collins to the Dallas Mavericks in exchange for Dorian Finney-Smith, Dwight Powell, and a 2024 second-round pick, sources tell ESPN.@sydneyisfunny @dallasmavs Marc Cuban = Da Goat. 😂😂😂😂@ShamsCharania @kevinsheehanDC @TheAthletic @Stadium Sources: Dallas Mavericks trading Kristaps Porzingis to Washington Wizards for Spencer Dinwiddie, Davis BertansThe Washington Wizards have acquired 26-year old big man Kristaps Porzingis and a second-round pick from the Dallas Mavericks for Spencer Dinwiddie and Davis Bertans. https://t.co/bOuAS3XtIaSo no Marcus Morris or Myles Turner Damn. @dallasmavs you never fail to disappoint@YaBoiTPoo_ @MavsPR @redditmavericks @TexasLegends @dallasmavs Mavs wanting to make Luka request a trade lmaoWow. @dallasmavs …

▪︎Kristaps Porzingis

Via: @wojespnThe Dallas Mavericks are going into the offseason with little space below the luxury tax. They have 15 players on their 2022-23 roster including their first-round pick.

This doesn't factor in Jalen Brunson and Dorian Finney-Smith who are unrestricted free agents this summer.the only way this would be even better is if the mavs got deni avdiya in that trade too. #byebyekp #lukadoncic #DallasMavericks go mavs #kpsucks https://t.co/N1Jw0V6AeePLEASE @mcuban @dallasmavs this trade just isn’t it…. PLEASE MAKE ANOTHER MOVE, A BETTER MOVEDam KP was one of my favorite @dallasmavs player .. now he gone 😭.. but I understand he can’t stay healthyThe @dallasmavs Porzingis experiment was bad and could be as bad for @WashWizards .

Richaun might be gettable for Powell, Burke and Josh Green@MattGregoryNews @dallasmavs @wusa9 I’ve used it!@dogmanp_sparks @jdon_jdon @MikeMJoseph @AaronBenRose who said Masai cares? Its about Dragic having value because one of the stars in the league has made it known he wants to play with them. That has value to the Dallas Mavericks. BTW Dragic just got traded for Thad Young and saved us $2M and brought a veteran PF for our younginsLET US KNOW WHEN GORAN DRAGIC IS A DALLAS MAVERICK 

WE ARE GOING TO SLEEP 😴If kp goes to Toronto that opens up the possibility of Randle going bac to his hometown team the @dallasmavs #KnicksAm I the only #mffl that is not interested in @dallasmavs signing Goran after he gets bought out?
