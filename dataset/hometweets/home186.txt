Minnesota Timberwolves vs Los Angeles ClippersThe Pelicans having an awful year and getting a top 3 pick will be better in the long run than if they finished in the lower seeds of the playoffs

I think having another young star alongside Zion and BI will make New Orleans more attractive to Zion for his future🏀 #NBA
