🟡 ORL ML +410Penn State up 8 on Indiana. Mike Woodson not only coach with NBA ties, new Penn State coach Micah Shrewsberry coached with Brad Stevens on Boston Celtics.@ArtCovUnion247 @LordBrOFFICIAL @BryenJ_5 @celtics When you have no ExCeltics in the organization, maybe that's why.

All I know is if the cut and move like last game and win by 20 and then Tatum comes back and we're back to slow down iso brick ball, then we will have a data point on the prob

Under 500 everything is on the table(Boston) Celtics
(Scotland) Celtics
(Ireland) Celtics

People are just starting to catch on -- to the Title.@celtics Damn i wanted @jaytatum0 and Robert Williams to play@DHendersonCO @LordBrOFFICIAL @BryenJ_5 @celtics These kids are too young. They probably barely remember 08, let alone back in the day when the Celtics were NBA royalty. Unfortunately that is no longer the expectation and the standard in Boston anymore.@celtics I sure hope Larry Legend never reads this. Lower back pain? Bird couldn’t even sit on the bench. Big toe sprain?? Bird broke his face in Indiana playoff game and played. This team complains about people being out your “best player” (JT) has to recondition. 🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡@LordBrOFFICIAL @BryenJ_5 @ArtCovUnion247 @celtics He's not THE PROBLEM.

But he is certainly PART of the problem.  That's undeniable.  

Basketball is team sport.  Well it use to be in Boston anyway....@celtics Dennis is back! He's gonna hog the ball for even longer now that JT is out@SkyBet do you know why you cannot bet on the Boston Celtics match ?@King46706884 @celtics Lakers fan 😭@LordBrOFFICIAL @DHendersonCO @BryenJ_5 @celtics The great ones have found ways to make it happen. Lebron, Giannis, KD. Having one of those guys is essentially a gaurentee top 3 seed regardless of who’s around them. Tatum can’t do that@PhillipM113 @celtics Off-Season@DHendersonCO @BryenJ_5 @LordBrOFFICIAL @celtics Facts, did we win the championship in any of those years? No. Failed seasons.@DHendersonCO @BryenJ_5 @ArtCovUnion247 @celtics Tatum not the problem, its the team as a whole, our bench is not deep at all, and nobody can contribute if tatum or brown have a bad night💀@DHendersonCO @BryenJ_5 @LordBrOFFICIAL @celtics He just doesn’t have the mentality of the great ones. Watch KD and Lebron, they just take over games differently. Tatum doesn’t have that.@BryenJ_5 @ArtCovUnion247 @LordBrOFFICIAL @celtics Forget other seasons... what about this year?@BryenJ_5 @DHendersonCO @LordBrOFFICIAL @celtics What are they since the beginning of 2020?@BryenJ_5 @LordBrOFFICIAL @ArtCovUnion247 @celtics How many game winners this year?

How many take over in the 4thQ and win games for us this year?

Again... just saying.

That's what the great ones do....even on a bad team.@LordBrOFFICIAL @BryenJ_5 @DHendersonCO @celtics Are they an above 500 team when Tatum plays? I don’t know I’m genuinely curious@ArtCovUnion247 @BryenJ_5 @DHendersonCO @celtics Nothing💀 we fasho aint shit when brown has to lead@BryenJ_5 @DHendersonCO @LordBrOFFICIAL @celtics Well, then what is it?@ArtCovUnion247 @LordBrOFFICIAL @celtics I think he is an incredible talent...unbelievable skills. 

Does he make players around him better or worse?  That's the big question.@BryenJ_5 @DHendersonCO @LordBrOFFICIAL @celtics What are they with Tatum?@LordBrOFFICIAL @DHendersonCO @celtics “I have no response to your logical argument so I’m going to spam emojis so it seems like I’m right”Boston Celtics: HH talks Russell Westbrook for Al Horford/Josh Richardson deal – NBA News https://t.co/oQ2tuRcwhY@DHendersonCO @LordBrOFFICIAL @celtics Agreed. I do think he could be a great player but he definitely needs to humble himself a bit. I think he’d be deadly as the #2 option on a team but he’s too selfish to be the main guy@LordBrOFFICIAL @ArtCovUnion247 @celtics Excuse me...Clippers game was without Smart.

Dude we are an under 500 basketball team for the last 100 games (almost all) with Tatum playing.

Could he be the problem? Slows the game down, Iso ball, many bad shots.... just saying.

He needs to lose the Kobe bullshit...@mr52pickup Boston Celtics Flash Challenge

Now we get to see if the problem is Tatum.  Timberwolves game was without Smart, FYI.   

But they beat the Suns easily with Smart back and Tatum out.  They also cut, moved without the ball, assisted, and played D.

So now we'll see... if that continues@ArtCovUnion247 @celtics wow you're weirder than I thoughtBoston Celtics 6 card lot!
