U realize u said the same thing about the @dallasmavs for the first 3 months &amp; then quickly got proven wrong ? Luka ain ‘ t walking through them globe life doors anytime soon but at least the @Rangers have their dignity , something us * fans can ‘ t quite say .This "Shark Tank" company made $130,000 in 6 days – and Mark Cuban wants the Dallas Mavericks to use its products.

More importantly, they actually moved the ball and forced Phx to play defense against 5 players instead of 1. @dallasmavs can still shoot better at home. I like their chances to even the series. https://t.co/1KgMmQZ9N0@dallasmavs Agreed@dallasmavs Cute kid, Dallas is cool city but Suns in 6
