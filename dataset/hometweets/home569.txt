They want a rebuild. They wont get 2 first rounders from anyone else (OKC is not trading for Turner)@kirbybobby1 @AlexFon25 @Suns @Gambo987 @Amareisreal Amare eventually had probably one of the most money 18 footers in the league but fact still remains nobody could stop Amare because he was physical unless it was rebounding üòÇ@john12680 @MikeGrabman @Jumpshot8 @JohnEhrenfeld @NBA @Suns @warriors @Bulls @nets @Bucks @memgrizz They're pretty sick of having both Sabonis &amp; Myles on the same team iirc, they want only one of them to remain so one of them alone can play the 5.   Trading for Adams creates the same problem for them all over again@john12680 @MikeGrabman @Jumpshot8 @JohnEhrenfeld @NBA @Suns @warriors @Bulls @nets @Bucks @memgrizz I do think he can be had but it probably has to be an overpay i.e. KAT or something similar, he can't really go anywhere as a restricted free agent and only like 2 teams have any cap space so it's kind of a bad time for him in terms of leverage.  Sarver is super cheap though yeah@AlexFon25 @YouknowMeMan1 @Suns @Gambo987 @Amareisreal So answer me this then how is it that @Amareisreal 2004 and 2007 suns averaged 26 and 25 points a game and dude was 6-9 and teams had better bigs then to defend? He was getting all the attention and dude only knew how to dunk?@Viscous_cree @MikeGrabman @Jumpshot8 @JohnEhrenfeld @NBA @Suns @warriors @Bulls @nets @Bucks @memgrizz You dont think they would take Adams and 2 firsts (lakers and Jazz) for Turner? or maybe Slomo and 2 firsts? I think they would@kirbybobby1 @YouknowMeMan1 @Suns @Gambo987 @Amareisreal He definitely is, but Biyombo and McGee don't garner as much attention as DA on rolls so they have way more opportunities to dunk it. They also come off the bench so their always facing bench Centers instead of starters.@MikeGrabman @john12680 @Jumpshot8 @JohnEhrenfeld @NBA @Suns @warriors @Bulls @nets @Bucks @memgrizz I remember browsing UNC fan reactions and they were ecstatic about Cam going to PHX which gave me hope, he hasn't disappointed in the slightest@Viscous_cree @MikeGrabman @Jumpshot8 @JohnEhrenfeld @NBA @Suns @warriors @Bulls @nets @Bucks @memgrizz yeah but 45-50 Million a year before the back half. Paul is expensive. Sarver is a cheap skate. You think Ayton is happy there after not getting extended? Maybe I am wrong. I think he can be had. But there is always someone  unhappy. Grizz have to trade but no FA is coming.@MikeGrabman @john12680 @Jumpshot8 @JohnEhrenfeld @NBA @Suns @warriors @Bulls @nets @Bucks @memgrizz Cam is almost definitely gone after his rookie deal sadly, even though he might be the best pure shooter on the team.   Ayton looking like the odd man out applies tenfold to Cam Johnson, unless you move on from one of the other starters or Cam agrees to take only $15M-$20M@AlexFon25 @YouknowMeMan1 @Suns @Gambo987 @Amareisreal Because DA isnt doing the pick and rolls like McGee or Biz. They pick and roll and dunk they are full steam ahead. If Da played like Mcgee and Biz dude would average 30 easy. Who is gonna stop him?@john12680 @MikeGrabman @Jumpshot8 @JohnEhrenfeld @NBA @Suns @warriors @Bulls @nets @Bucks @memgrizz I've always liked Sabonis, but he's like an even higher usage version of Jonas so if you were happy downgrading to Adams as it were idk if it makes sense to revert back to Sabonis.   Adams -&gt; Turner would be the upgrade but you'd need a 3rd team because for Indiana that's lateral@john12680 @MikeGrabman @Jumpshot8 @JohnEhrenfeld @NBA @Suns @warriors @Bulls @nets @Bucks @memgrizz Paul's contract is basically non-guaranteed in the back half, Mikal was already signed for very very good value, Booker is Booker you have to pay him, Ayton will be paid depending on if anybody overpays in RFA via offer sheet.   Otherwise he probably doesn't get maxed imo@sbryaant_ @Suns @AndrewLeezus Ain't no way dude would wanna play with Chris Paul lol@Viscous_cree @MikeGrabman @Jumpshot8 @JohnEhrenfeld @NBA @Suns @warriors @Bulls @nets @Bucks @memgrizz Sarver isn‚Äôt paying Paul booker bridges and ayton/Kat. I think ayton is odd man out. He can be had. But that would be a good trade for Minny. But there are other options for Memphis. Sabonis/turner. Siakim (wouldn‚Äôt be my pick). Zion (cough).Dirk my favorite PF of all time followed by Phoenix Suns Amare Stoudimire hope I spelled that right@john12680 @MikeGrabman @Jumpshot8 @JohnEhrenfeld @NBA @Suns @warriors @Bulls @nets @Bucks @memgrizz Suns have wanted KAT forever, it's been rumored for years that they'd be willing to move Ayton for him.   Idk if moving him for Steven Adams and some mid-tier draft picks makes alot of sense

Celtics, who knows.   They could use the depth so a 4-for-1 or 5-for-1 would help themThat would be the @Suns, not the @warriors. https://t.co/ThDQZCR1Ob@guyfromsoccer @blazindw I‚Äôd like to nominate Phoenix for collective worst. Redeemed only by the Suns.@MikeGrabman @john12680 @Jumpshot8 @JohnEhrenfeld @NBA @Suns @warriors @Bulls @nets @Bucks @memgrizz Oof yikes, didn't know that about JV's spouse@john12680 @MikeGrabman @Jumpshot8 @JohnEhrenfeld @NBA @Suns @warriors @Bulls @nets @Bucks @memgrizz That's fair, although giving up a 1st just to move off Adams' contract sounds painful

So you think no way Adams is around past next offseason?   He might have rehabilitated his value slightly in MEM but idk if it's by that much.   Most can't afford to start a non-offensive big@Viscous_cree @MikeGrabman @Jumpshot8 @JohnEhrenfeld @NBA @Suns @warriors @Bulls @nets @Bucks @memgrizz I‚Äôm quite enjoying the I think friendly discussion.@AndrewLeezus @Suns True, if we never signed Biyombo, Cousins would‚Äôve been perfect counterpart to Javale Abdul Jabbar@MikeGrabman @john12680 @Jumpshot8 @JohnEhrenfeld @NBA @Suns @warriors @Bulls @nets @Bucks @memgrizz Most of us can't really go outside rn so what else are we gonna do lolRemember when most people where saying that the @Suns made a terrible, horrible mistake and gave up too much for CP3? That they gave up too much in *checks notes* Ricky Rubio and Kelly Oubre? No? Okay.@sbryaant_ @Suns Wouldn‚Äôt have been terrible but Lowkey Jalen McGee and Bismack elite@Suns üòóüëÄ

#ValleyProud https://t.co/7ccJ3NzdxI@Viscous_cree @MikeGrabman @Jumpshot8 @JohnEhrenfeld @NBA @Suns @warriors @Bulls @nets @Bucks @memgrizz Grizz can‚Äôt afford 25-27 for non rim protecting center (they have young guys to pay). Adams either plays next year or is dealt (his contract is very moveable especially with 3 firsts in next years draft). Plus a first round pick and a lottery pick in swaps.@Viscous_cree @MikeGrabman @Jumpshot8 @JohnEhrenfeld @NBA @Suns @warriors @Bulls @nets @Bucks @memgrizz So mil, gsw, Phoenix, Utah, Chicago? Nets? Heat? Makes sense. Memphis probably right there at that 6-9 spot.@Suns y‚Äôall kno what to do https://t.co/CDn8jm2jQA@ACfor3_NFT @flovatar Phoenix Suns @tiny_by_naturee @Cap_Plantain@john12680 @MikeGrabman @Jumpshot8 @JohnEhrenfeld @NBA @Suns @warriors @Bulls @nets @Bucks @memgrizz Steven Adams is being paid $35M/2 to set screens and average 7/9/3 it's not like your saving THAT much money lol, he isn't going to get that much cheaper either.   I don't think Jonas gets maxed or anything like that he probably gets $25-27M per year and you're gonna re-up Adams@Viscous_cree @MikeGrabman @Jumpshot8 @JohnEhrenfeld @NBA @Suns @warriors @Bulls @nets @Bucks @memgrizz Very good point. Okc game in particular messed the numbers up. But they also looked stout against Phoenix and the nets on the road. Underrated win against the cavs on the second night of a road back to back short handed.@camjordan94 @PelicansNBA Not too many @Saints and @Suns combo fans out there. I am one! Saints fan from Phoenix here ü§éüñ§ü§éüñ§  üíúüß°üíúüß°@MikeGrabman @john12680 @Jumpshot8 @JohnEhrenfeld @NBA @Suns @warriors @Bulls @nets @Bucks @memgrizz Top 8?   Yeah sure

Top 5?   No@john12680 @MikeGrabman @Jumpshot8 @JohnEhrenfeld @NBA @Suns @warriors @Bulls @nets @Bucks @memgrizz Over half of your games in the last 20 contests have been against bottom 15 offenses so I'd hope so.   SAC, HOU, OKC, DAL, LAL and almost all of them you've played 2-3x@Viscous_cree @MikeGrabman @Jumpshot8 @JohnEhrenfeld @NBA @Suns @warriors @Bulls @nets @Bucks @memgrizz Good for Jonas putting up big numbers. I‚Äôm sure the grizz are even happier when some team way overpays or the pelicans keep him. Meanwhile the grizz are rebounding better than ever and Ja is ascending. Also they will flip that first (Myles turner, cam reddish) the trade isn‚Äôt a l@Viscous_cree @MikeGrabman @Jumpshot8 @JohnEhrenfeld @NBA @Suns @warriors @Bulls @nets @Bucks @memgrizz Add in the contracts and the fact that the grizz wouldn‚Äôt have been able to resign Jonas ( by the way huge favorite in Memphis) and the addition of picking up Z. Williams and the Lakers first make this trade look much better.@Viscous_cree @MikeGrabman @Jumpshot8 @JohnEhrenfeld @NBA @Suns @warriors @Bulls @nets @Bucks @memgrizz I could care less where you rank the grizz. I was just saying the narrative around the Jonas - Adams trade is lazy. The grizz sucked on defense the first 15 games then got better (much better). Adams has played really well while having lower usage which is also a plus.@MikeGrabman @john12680 @Jumpshot8 @JohnEhrenfeld @NBA @Suns @warriors @Bulls @nets @Bucks @memgrizz Alright dude cool@MikeGrabman @john12680 @Jumpshot8 @JohnEhrenfeld @NBA @Suns @warriors @Bulls @nets @Bucks @memgrizz Bro y'all are the original ones who got upset üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ

Y'all are barely playing defense when you're winning, and the Pelicans have a much worse rosterMy most and least confident (players/teams) while sports betting:

NBA Best: Joel Embid / Phoenix Suns
NBA Least: De'Aaron Fox / Kings

NFL Best: Lamar Jackson / Cardinals (to lose)
NFL Least: Justin Herbert / Seahawks
