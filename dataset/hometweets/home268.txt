Analysts straight up HAVE said that getting Fultz back makes Orlando a competitive team.@BeenKnightedUCF @Tweets_By_Barry @JNCO_suave @Akumpo__ @unitedweare23 @OrlandoMagic And no disrespect I love kel but how many yrs he been in the league and the only thing he’s barely better at is playmaking. WOW@kostas_burner @Tweets_By_Barry @JNCO_suave @Akumpo__ @unitedweare23 @OrlandoMagic Great, but he showed zero competence and zero leadership. I LOVE cole. He is my favorite player on Orlando by far. But he is maybe the third best player on a fully healthy Magic roster at best. I fully expect Suggs to be better than Cole too.@BeenKnightedUCF @Tweets_By_Barry @Akumpo__ @unitedweare23 @OrlandoMagic On offense yeah prob. His d is not too shabby either but JI is the best defender in the league when healthy. The only giannis stopper in existence@BeenKnightedUCF @Tweets_By_Barry @Akumpo__ @unitedweare23 @OrlandoMagic All analyst and nba media people would agree on this 🤓@BeenKnightedUCF @Tweets_By_Barry @JNCO_suave @Akumpo__ @unitedweare23 @OrlandoMagic Idk maybe because Cole was a rookie ?@JNCO_suave @Tweets_By_Barry @Akumpo__ @unitedweare23 @OrlandoMagic lol you probably think Suggs is more impactful and a better player than Isaac.@BeenKnightedUCF @kostas_burner @Tweets_By_Barry @Akumpo__ @unitedweare23 @OrlandoMagic His ball movement is spectacular tho. The offense flows well with him. Yeah he’s always gonna be a liability on d but so is Wendell right now lmao@BeenKnightedUCF @kostas_burner @Tweets_By_Barry @Akumpo__ @unitedweare23 @OrlandoMagic Cole is better now like way fucking better?@JNCO_suave @kostas_burner @Tweets_By_Barry @Akumpo__ @unitedweare23 @OrlandoMagic Dude have you seen vooch this year?

Orange isn't it@BeenKnightedUCF @Tweets_By_Barry @Akumpo__ @unitedweare23 @OrlandoMagic People that make Twitter profiles dedicated to random basketball players that have zero idea who they are and never will are the TRUE hoopers lmfaoaoaoaoaoo@kostas_burner @Tweets_By_Barry @JNCO_suave @Akumpo__ @unitedweare23 @OrlandoMagic And how come as soon as Fultz got hurt last year and Cole got to use those “weapons” in Gordon and Vooch, the Magic became IMMEDIATELY the worst team in basketball? Didnt take 2-3 games to get there. The INSTANT fultz went down they became the least efficient team in the NBA@BeenKnightedUCF @kostas_burner @Tweets_By_Barry @Akumpo__ @unitedweare23 @OrlandoMagic Oh you REALLY think Wendell&gt;Vuc and aren’t just trolling lol wow@kostas_burner @Tweets_By_Barry @JNCO_suave @Akumpo__ @unitedweare23 @OrlandoMagic Wendell has had a better year this season than Vooch, and Aaron Gordon was NOT good in Orlando at all😂everyone wanted him AND vooch traded because they didn’t provide much other than empty stats, like Cole.@BeenKnightedUCF @Tweets_By_Barry @Akumpo__ @unitedweare23 @OrlandoMagic Lol mk buddy I’ll fucking deuce you up tomorrow where’s the court at@JNCO_suave @Tweets_By_Barry @Akumpo__ @unitedweare23 @OrlandoMagic Defensive efficiency is a basic stat that pretty much everyone uses...your basketball IQ is below the floor. I can tell just by the way you speak that you’ve never played, coached or been involved with the game other than watching. It’s painfully obvious.@BeenKnightedUCF @Tweets_By_Barry @JNCO_suave @Akumpo__ @unitedweare23 @OrlandoMagic Obviously the magic aren’t gonna start good without another actual top tier player. Kel had vooch and Aaron Gordon who I’m taking over anyone else on the current magic besides obv Cole and franz@JNCO_suave @Tweets_By_Barry @Akumpo__ @unitedweare23 @OrlandoMagic so thank you for pointing that out. Proves my point even further that Cole is a liability defensively@BeenKnightedUCF @Tweets_By_Barry @Akumpo__ @unitedweare23 @OrlandoMagic You don’t feel weird at all going on your little roller coaster ride of dumbass stats lmfaoooaoa@JNCO_suave @Tweets_By_Barry @Akumpo__ @unitedweare23 @OrlandoMagic I’m very glad you aren’t Orlando’s GM, coach, etc lol because you’d tank this team into the ground with your takes@Tweets_By_Barry @BeenKnightedUCF @Akumpo__ @unitedweare23 @OrlandoMagic Then mute me idgaf I’m gonna speak my truth and THE TRUTH IS Cole&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;fultz has EVER been@JNCO_suave @Tweets_By_Barry @Akumpo__ @unitedweare23 @OrlandoMagic Atlanta and Orlando are ranked 27th and 28th respectively in defensive efficiency as a team, so they are pretty much exactly the same caliber on defense. The fact that Cole is STILL 13 points worse than Trae despite that, makes it look even WORSE...@JNCO_suave @BeenKnightedUCF @Akumpo__ @unitedweare23 @OrlandoMagic How many asses are you going to laugh off?  So tired of the fans (of any team) thinking it's all about PPG, completely ignoring everything else.@BeenKnightedUCF @kostas_burner @Tweets_By_Barry @Akumpo__ @unitedweare23 @OrlandoMagic What a sample size lmfaoaoaoao he could find Vuc in his spots when Vuc had the best year of his career WTF is he gonna do with no motor Bamba and why dell carter@Court_Cousins @wojespn @OrlandoMagic I’m surprised that our fan based hasn’t completely gone of the rails about his lack of production and his body language! He doesn’t want to be here!@kostas_burner @Tweets_By_Barry @JNCO_suave @Akumpo__ @unitedweare23 @OrlandoMagic He does not run the floor well at all yet...he makes terrible decision after terrible decision outside of those games where he goes off. Fultz consistently is a floor general, and is THE reason Orlando got off to a hot start last year@BeenKnightedUCF @Tweets_By_Barry @Akumpo__ @unitedweare23 @OrlandoMagic Yeah man that stat has nothing to do with how good your team is lmfaoaoaoaoaoao@JNCO_suave @Tweets_By_Barry @Akumpo__ @unitedweare23 @OrlandoMagic there is absolutely nothing that would suggest that...wtf😂Trae is literally a whole THIRTEEN POINTS per 100 possessions better...jesus man https://t.co/Zg7rKzCQ4a@BeenKnightedUCF @Tweets_By_Barry @Akumpo__ @unitedweare23 @OrlandoMagic They shot a helluva lot better from 3 when Cole was in. I’m over this you guys obv think fultz is insanely good. I hope you’re right. But he hasn’t been yet lol he’s showed signs yes but he’s showed signs since his debut in philly@BeenKnightedUCF @Tweets_By_Barry @JNCO_suave @Akumpo__ @unitedweare23 @OrlandoMagic I’ve watched every magic game this season. If u also have u would know everytime Cole is on the court they are ALOT better. Doesn’t matter if he’s not shooting well he runs the offense as good as any other second yr player and always gets his teammates the looks they need@BeenKnightedUCF @Tweets_By_Barry @Akumpo__ @unitedweare23 @OrlandoMagic Cole spreads the floor for them fultz will find them in open spots but good luck getting open lol@JNCO_suave @Tweets_By_Barry @Akumpo__ @unitedweare23 @OrlandoMagic also...been trash with and without cole...no differencePreview: Hornets conclude three-game road trip in Orlando against the Magic https://t.co/GgrsHhERr2@BeenKnightedUCF @Tweets_By_Barry @Akumpo__ @unitedweare23 @OrlandoMagic I’d honestly say cole is way better on d than trae but go off I don’t watch@JNCO_suave @Tweets_By_Barry @Akumpo__ @unitedweare23 @OrlandoMagic Maybe because they don’t have another PG, which is the problem Fultz would solve...Suggs has been awful, as expected from a rookie PG...omg man😂of course they’re gonna suck if they don’t have a single competent PG playing@OrlandoMagic no more orange !!!!11/24/89 – #Suns reserves were outscored 16-0 to start the 4Q, so "only" up 28p, Cotton brought back his starters, allowing Jeff Hornacek to record the first triple-double of his career, 22p/12r/15a, in a 121-94 win over the Orlando Magic.

Disney SALUTE Teams Make Holiday Magic in Orlando and Anaheim Communities

https://t.co/FzOeugB3xo#ICYMI on #TheShow on the #ScoreWI, @LeoKiperJr &amp; @EricBalkman talked about what made the @bucks win over the @orlandomagic so historic on #BuckItUp:
 https://t.co/EzscFYTflH https://t.co/l4cF34VHri@BeenKnightedUCF @kostas_burner @Tweets_By_Barry @Akumpo__ @unitedweare23 @OrlandoMagic Fultz disappeared half the game every game besides the laker game but go off on your imaginary past@JNCO_suave @Tweets_By_Barry @Akumpo__ @unitedweare23 @OrlandoMagic Neither of them are even close to as bad at defense as cole is(cole is in a different stratosphere of bad defense my guy), and they’re WAY better than him and WAY more consistent offensively, what is your point there 😂@BeenKnightedUCF @Tweets_By_Barry @Akumpo__ @unitedweare23 @OrlandoMagic Been trash since cole got hurt lmfao. I don’t watch tho ;)@kostas_burner @Tweets_By_Barry @JNCO_suave @Akumpo__ @unitedweare23 @OrlandoMagic You don’t watch the Magic either 😂 Cole is wayyyyy too inconsistent. He can score 30 in one game, great! But then lay an egg 2-3 games straight. That’s not cool. Fultz is consistently helping the team and not hurting them every single game.@BeenKnightedUCF @Tweets_By_Barry @Akumpo__ @unitedweare23 @OrlandoMagic Meanwhile Steph and trae might both be in the finals this year lol@JNCO_suave @Tweets_By_Barry @Akumpo__ @unitedweare23 @OrlandoMagic bro this take is awful...you say you watch Orlando and then say things that indicate otherwise...Bamba and Wendell have been great from 3...so has RJ...@JNCO_suave @Tweets_By_Barry @Akumpo__ @unitedweare23 @OrlandoMagic If you can score but immediately give up points on the other side of the floor because you suck ass at defense (no really, he is TERRIBLE at defense, it’s tough to watch)...how much of an impact are you really making???@Tweets_By_Barry @BeenKnightedUCF @JNCO_suave @Akumpo__ @unitedweare23 @OrlandoMagic Fultz and Cole are both good but if u think fultz is better than Cole then ur delusional. U can’t bring up him being #1 pick to help ur argument because that doesn’t mean anything besides he was a good player at lower levels@Tweets_By_Barry @BeenKnightedUCF @Akumpo__ @unitedweare23 @OrlandoMagic Then why does he suck lmao@OrlandoMagic the white jerseys the best jerseys ever@JNCO_suave @BeenKnightedUCF @Akumpo__ @unitedweare23 @OrlandoMagic Correction, he's not top 10, but shooting over 40% from 3@Tweets_By_Barry @BeenKnightedUCF @Akumpo__ @unitedweare23 @OrlandoMagic If you TRULY think fultz &gt; Cole idk what I’m even doing here lol I mean at certain things sure but having a dude who can actually SCORE is a big deal. Be ready to be disappointed when he’s back@JNCO_suave @BeenKnightedUCF @Akumpo__ @unitedweare23 @OrlandoMagic WCJ is top 10 in 3 pt %, and has above avg FG % though, and Bamba has cooled down from 3, but still shooting 45% from the field.@BeenKnightedUCF @Tweets_By_Barry @Akumpo__ @unitedweare23 @OrlandoMagic Yeah having a point guard helps make a team good. Can’t wait for fultz to drop absolute dimes for Bamba and Wendell for them to BRICK it just like they have been all season long@JNCO_suave @Tweets_By_Barry @Akumpo__ @unitedweare23 @OrlandoMagic Most of the NBA experts and talking heads and whatnot have the same opinion lol. That Orlando is missing Fultz very very badly. Again, he was a #1 pick for a reason and this year he is finally going to have the keys to the team.@BeenKnightedUCF @Tweets_By_Barry @Akumpo__ @unitedweare23 @OrlandoMagic Prob as long as how old you are lol bout to get fucking blocked tho putting words in my mouth@JNCO_suave @Tweets_By_Barry @Akumpo__ @unitedweare23 @OrlandoMagic He has won the Magic 4 games in 18 attempts. Fultz won Orlando 6 games in 8 attempts, and the instant he went down the Magic were the least efficient team in basketball.@BeenKnightedUCF @Tweets_By_Barry @Akumpo__ @unitedweare23 @OrlandoMagic Idk what fultz y’all watched but I hope you guys are right lmfao@Tweets_By_Barry @JNCO_suave @Akumpo__ @unitedweare23 @OrlandoMagic I’m not sure how much basketball this person has watched in their lifetime if they’re telling me net rating means nothing lmfao@BeenKnightedUCF @Tweets_By_Barry @Akumpo__ @unitedweare23 @OrlandoMagic He’s quite literally the only reason we’ve won any games at all this season@JNCO_suave @BeenKnightedUCF @Akumpo__ @unitedweare23 @OrlandoMagic Ummmm... point differential is a pretty good barometer of winning. If our bench was at least average we'd be a middle of the pack team.@OrlandoMagic Shoulda kept the number font@JNCO_suave @Tweets_By_Barry @Akumpo__ @unitedweare23 @OrlandoMagic Cole is not winning the Magic games 😂@JNCO_suave @Tweets_By_Barry @Akumpo__ @unitedweare23 @OrlandoMagic The fact that you’re basing it off of THAT is what makes you a hater my guy. Fultz makes an impact on every single aspect of the court, and he has NEVER had a chance to have the keys to the team because Orlando kept giving the ball to Fournier, Vooch, etcDisney SALUTE Teams volunteered to make extra holiday magic in Orlando and Anaheim this Thanksgiving season! https://t.co/Y3cdmQJhlZ@Tweets_By_Barry @BeenKnightedUCF @Akumpo__ @unitedweare23 @OrlandoMagic Ok when we get fultz back and lose every game I’ll come back to this tweet lol@Tweets_By_Barry @JNCO_suave @Akumpo__ @unitedweare23 @OrlandoMagic Yep. It’s partially on Mosley, but I don’t blame him wanting to have a veteran presence. Our vets just absolutely suck. Ross is legitimately the least efficient player in the NBA at the moment. And he is always the first sub@BeenKnightedUCF @Tweets_By_Barry @Akumpo__ @unitedweare23 @OrlandoMagic Cool stats win games lol cole was just about as good as fultz BEFORE he blew his knee out and has now surpassed him@JNCO_suave @Tweets_By_Barry @Akumpo__ @unitedweare23 @OrlandoMagic The issue is Mosley takes the starting lineup out wayyyy too soon. Subs in Ross just a few minutes into the game. Magic ALWAYS get off to a hot start, and Fultz/Harris etc ALWAYS ruin any momentum the team had, and puts the team in a deep hole.@Tweets_By_Barry @BeenKnightedUCF @Akumpo__ @unitedweare23 @OrlandoMagic Meanwhile fultz be like 12 points, 8 points 19 points!!!!, 8 points again lol ok NOW I’m a hater@JNCO_suave @BeenKnightedUCF @Akumpo__ @unitedweare23 @OrlandoMagic Check the stats and point differential when the starters are on the floor.@OrlandoMagic Glad Penny never had to endure wearing those hideous orange unis.@JNCO_suave @Tweets_By_Barry @Akumpo__ @unitedweare23 @OrlandoMagic So does everyone. Cole makes bad decisions, turns the ball over too much, doesn’t defend NEARLY on the level of Fultz, in fact he’s a liability on defense, and he is not NEARLY the passer that Fultz is...none of these are even arguable. Cole has cool stats but isn’t as impactful@JNCO_suave @BeenKnightedUCF @Akumpo__ @unitedweare23 @OrlandoMagic Once Cole gets more consistent (one game scoring 25, next one getting 12, next one getting 20, then another one 14), he'll be a star.@BeenKnightedUCF @Tweets_By_Barry @Akumpo__ @unitedweare23 @OrlandoMagic It’s gonna take more than a solid bench to make this team good. If our starters were actually as good as that stat makes them out to be we wouldn’t be getting blown out on a nightly basis and we’d have the lead more than 20 seconds per game@OrlandoMagic @JJudahIsaac I just saw a vid y’all put out yesterday the footage was from JI birthday to begin the clip… he appears to be taller than Mo now! Had JI grown?Ready for the first City Night of the year at @AmwayCenter @OrlandoMagic #MagicTogether https://t.co/P54eByr54W@BeenKnightedUCF @Tweets_By_Barry @Akumpo__ @unitedweare23 @OrlandoMagic You also think fultz is better than cole so idk mannnn lmao@OrlandoMagic Get rid of the shitty current logo@OrlandoMagic As long as the pinstripes r there im fine with it

Also wish Magic jerseys were more accessible worldwide@OrlandoMagic Old jerseys was slick loves the black with white pinstripes too. Also the old court with the checkered board look was badass@OrlandoMagic lawyer needed more@JNCO_suave @Tweets_By_Barry @Akumpo__ @unitedweare23 @OrlandoMagic I also don’t want you to think that I’m saying “so far Fultz has been better in his career than Isaac”. Isaac, so far, has been better. But Fultz makes a huge impact either way. I do think Fultz’ potential is still where it was, the only thing he is missing is a shot right now.@OrlandoMagic Get rid of the orange@OrlandoMagic Wrong colors !@OrlandoMagic Bring Back Original!@JNCO_suave @Tweets_By_Barry @Akumpo__ @unitedweare23 @OrlandoMagic It does. The Magic statistically have one of the best starting lineups in the league(emphasis on statistically). The bench is by far the worst in the league. Fultz either moves one of our good starters to the bench, or improves the bench mightily himself. That’s HUGE for any teampast meets present https://t.co/UVWTMmNmPpOrlando Magic…PLEASE https://t.co/LjFGGIAPdC@BeenKnightedUCF @Tweets_By_Barry @Akumpo__ @unitedweare23 @OrlandoMagic Them deer legs@BeenKnightedUCF @Tweets_By_Barry @Akumpo__ @unitedweare23 @OrlandoMagic I’m just saying that the dude has a point with fultz coming back not making too big of a difference but JI coming back making a big difference that’s all. Yeah he helps a bit forsureWikipedia page Orlando Magic has possibly been vandalized. https://t.co/bqDlw3G49G@JNCO_suave @Tweets_By_Barry @Akumpo__ @unitedweare23 @OrlandoMagic I never said he’s anywhere near prime Rose. He isn’t gonna win MVP anytime soon. You don’t understand how bad Orlando is right now. Fultz is a good player coming into replace likely a very very very very bad player. That’s important.@JNCO_suave @Tweets_By_Barry @Akumpo__ @unitedweare23 @OrlandoMagic I agree that JI is a lockdown defender, but HE has missed, outside of a handful of games in the bubble, over 2 years...that’s not good. I want him to be successful, and think he can, but the chance that he makes an impact THIS year compared to Fultz is very very slimNBA Temporada: 31-29

Idk maybe he practiced his threes a lot while injured and will prove me wrong. JI brings a lot more to the table when healthy@JNCO_suave @Tweets_By_Barry @Akumpo__ @unitedweare23 @OrlandoMagic The games they win will be because Orlando played well, NOT because the other team absolutely sucked.@JNCO_suave @Tweets_By_Barry @Akumpo__ @unitedweare23 @OrlandoMagic Yes we may keep losing. But the team will look competent. Currently, even the games we win require the other team to play so poorly that the game is hard to watch. Fultz makes Magic games so much easier to watch because his movements are so smooth and he’s a natural ball player.@JNCO_suave @Tweets_By_Barry @Akumpo__ @unitedweare23 @OrlandoMagic Thats something that’s going to improve with time most likely. Even if it doesn’t, he brings so much that our team is missing.@Tweets_By_Barry @BeenKnightedUCF @Akumpo__ @unitedweare23 @OrlandoMagic Our defense will have top 5 potential. Fultz brings ball movement but not much shooting@Tweets_By_Barry @BeenKnightedUCF @Akumpo__ @unitedweare23 @OrlandoMagic We have PLENTY of issues but yeah that’s a major one forsure. Like I said be ready to keep losing when he comes back. When JI comes back tho I expect the wins to come@JNCO_suave @BeenKnightedUCF @Akumpo__ @unitedweare23 @OrlandoMagic The thing that's absolutely killing us is not having a backup pg worth a shit. Literally the thing we need more than anything right now., Fultz solves that issue.GiGi's heads to the Cavs game!

We’ve started strong seasons a few times with Vuc and settled flat then ended semi strong. That was like clockwork. Fultz was subpar I watched every single game some multiple times. Teams don’t have to guard him.

https://t.co/0Ir06BWLZJ@JNCO_suave @BeenKnightedUCF @Akumpo__ @unitedweare23 @OrlandoMagic He came back from not playing like a year and a half to get like 13 and 5, and started last season going for about 17 and 7 (not including the game he was injured 5 min into that lowered is per game avgs), and the Magic looked SO much better.@Tweets_By_Barry @BeenKnightedUCF @Akumpo__ @unitedweare23 @OrlandoMagic He’s not better than cole has been this year. Delusional if you think so lol he was OK@BeenKnightedUCF @JNCO_suave @Akumpo__ @unitedweare23 @OrlandoMagic He's the only PG on the team that can truly be called a "facilitator". His assists numbers would've been so much higher if he had other people making shots besides Vooch.@BeenKnightedUCF @Akumpo__ @Tweets_By_Barry @unitedweare23 @OrlandoMagic I wouldn’t say huge lol better yes but not near his number one pick expectation. Did you ONLY watch that one laker game where he went off?

The Magic don’t look like a basketball team when he isn’t on the court.@BeenKnightedUCF @Tweets_By_Barry @Akumpo__ @unitedweare23 @OrlandoMagic Feels longer blame the weed/covid lol y’all are some nut jobs@BeenKnightedUCF @Akumpo__ @Tweets_By_Barry @unitedweare23 @OrlandoMagic Ok we might be overrating fultz JUST A TAD lmao@Tweets_By_Barry @Akumpo__ @JNCO_suave @unitedweare23 @OrlandoMagic This is exactly what the guy doesn’t get lol. The Magic starting lineup has a top 3 net rating in basketball...the bench is whats tearing the team down...Fultz provides that depth the Magic need so badly. JI back makes them even deeper.@Akumpo__ @BeenKnightedUCF @JNCO_suave @unitedweare23 @OrlandoMagic Ok, we get it, you've watched two Magic games in the last 5 years. It's about getting deeper. We have the worst bench in the League, and it's not even close. Moving Suggs to the bench and starting Fultz, or vice versa, would do wonders.@Akumpo__ @Tweets_By_Barry @JNCO_suave @unitedweare23 @OrlandoMagic Again, you’re an idiot if you think Cole is even close to Fultz lol. You don’t watch the Magic.@Tweets_By_Barry @JNCO_suave @Akumpo__ @unitedweare23 @OrlandoMagic People are clueless man lol. Fultz will make a massive impact the instant he comes back. He’s that dude.@BeenKnightedUCF @JNCO_suave @Akumpo__ @unitedweare23 @OrlandoMagic For real.

I don’t like Randle or Thibs and until I see Randle get this team out the 1st round, I ain’t seeing that bio. I’ve been saying as long as Randle is our #1 who doesn’t pass the ball for shit we’re just the 2018-19 Orlando Magic.@opinionsondanba Dragged the magic to the playoffs back to back years, teams always played for him and loved him, excellent defensive coach with suboptimal pieces in Orlando

He's got more left to give! @memgrizz ? @nyknicks ? @OrlandoMagic ? https://t.co/UCbxfPl1Z1Lol if a @OrlandoMagic player hit that shot it would have been reviewed for 6 minutes and then overturned for traveling.@scottptb30 @KY_PDX @503Blazerfans Comparing to what Orlando got, that wasn’t necessary. One of the two young guys, a future protected pick + expiring salaries would have gotten it done. Magic took on Gary Harris salary for another season (wasn’t expiring. Making 20 million this year) with a future pick and RJHBucks make franchise history in win over Orlando Magic https://t.co/bfpHO9i16xi deadass forgot orlando magic exists  💀@MjBaby23 Yes pretty much but still love the @OrlandoMagicRockwell Automation is excited to be SHPE's title sponsor for this years Magic of Innovation hackathon challenge!

They can make any lead disappear right before your eyes!”In 1988, New Orleans Hornets and Miami Heat joined the NBA. 1990 Orlando Magic and Minnesota Timberwolves joined the NBA.@rads619 @alanhahn No, the jerseys are Knicks jerseys.
