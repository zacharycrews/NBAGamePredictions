#LetEmKnow https://t.co/EOnxlhD7FD@bduerREP @cavs Without him there wouldn’t have been an 1986 draft, Lenny Wilkins &amp; no Jordan over Ehlo. No LeBron James. No 2016 💍. None of that would have happened in and for Cleveland. Maybe in Toronto, not Cleveland. That’s why more than anything his number should be retired with the Cavs.@cavs @BallySportsCLE @CampyRussell @RMFieldHouse When times were simple I miss this trio https://t.co/v2BNYj1jUs@bduerREP @cavs It’s seems hyperbolic to younger fans, but considering that without his impact in saving the franchise from moving &amp; making Stepien a footnote in Cavs history, his charisma &amp; exploits, especially the 84/85 season, World B Free might be the most important player in Cavs history.The Cleveland Cavaliers have a 1.8% chance of winning the NBA Finals, per basketball reference https://t.co/y3L6s3k6dfNBA Betting Preview: Chicago Bulls vs. Cleveland Cavaliers - Saturday, March 26, 2022 https://t.co/mNHGzOzf35@MaxeyBetta @cavs @BallySportsCLE @CampyRussell @RMFieldHouse ironicForever etched in Cavalier history ❤️💛

How am i crying when yall about to lose to the bulls and we about to  take that spot@zbond19 @SwipaCam @Raptors @cavs @nuggets That's a defeatist mentality. Even if they have better overall teams right now, that's still no excuse to lose to a team like the @okcthunder at home.

Especially recently@itssjuszach Cleveland Cavaliers guard Collin Sexton suffered a torn meniscus to his left knee, team says. No immediate timetable on a return, more testing to come, but expect Sexton to have an extended absence from 7-4 Cavs.Consensus Line Move:

To this day my kids still call him dad, and that brings a smile to my face every morning.@zbond19 @SwipaCam Exactly. That's why every game matters. Losing to the @okcthunder cannot happen. Collapsing in the fourth quarter to the @Raptors cannot happen. Choking to the @cavs cannot happen. If the @nuggets won those games, Jokic would be firmly in the #1 spot.
