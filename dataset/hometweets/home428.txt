How sweet that was.Now With the Houston Rockets, Daniel Theis Sells $2.2M Boston-Area Home https://t.co/2jHo7XFkVuAs a #Cavs fan I want to say thank you to the @HoustonRockets for trading Harden to Brooklyn so the @cavs could get Allen, and also for taking Green at 2 so we could get Mobley!  They are givers!  To show our gratitude we GAVE them a beating last night!  #LetEmKnow@rcb05 @JorfiD Fox Sports regional channels mostly cover these.

Fox Sports Southwest would get me Spurs, Rangers, and HS games and there is Fox Sports Houston which I believe cover Astros and Rockets games.

https://t.co/U97EUpCWwQGoing to be dedicating my time on the microphone tonight during our @HoustonRockets game to a childhood friend and wonderful person @sshamner  - she passed away unexpectedly yesterday. My prayers are with her entire family 🙏The next time my prediction machine has the Wizards with better than coin flip odds of winning is January 3 against the Houston Rockets. They have 9 games before that one.@Honus55 @HoustonRockets TRUTH.....@marioelie1 @HoustonRockets As a kid I remember watching him play, and as an adult I watched him win the titles as a coach.  He was such an easy guy to root for...👍Daniel theis a center if the Houston Rockets are looking to move him then they should replace him with a 6’11 or 6’10 Pf. Bcos after the cavs game it became obvious the rockets needs size and heights.if they move Danuel House they can as well get another 7.0 or 6’11 pf.Trying to cut the cord with DirecTV but don't want to lose AT&amp;T SportsNet SW (Astros and Rockets) or Ballys (TX HS FB) any Houston folks found a streaming service that provides both?@marioelie1 @HoustonRockets Don't ever underestimate da heart of a champion 🚀🚀🚀🚀🤟🤟🤟🚀🚀🚀@DoughBo32869116 @RyanKlimaszews5 @HoustonRockets Dude your team literally got smacked last night from the start of the game to the end.

I ain't mad@YordongCockarez @cincyCTK @HoustonRockets @kroger Right@J0ZlF @sahteolmayan9 @c7haddad @HoustonRockets Literally no one said he plays perfect, we just want the best player on this team to play 30+ minutes@HtownJ99 @mariuscojocaruu @HoustonRockets IMO no he doesn’t. His defense is horrendous and he isn’t a good playmaker. As a scorer he’s gonna be good but outside of that he’s not all thatMy god the Houston rockets are the worst team in the history of the nba.@justtxyank @HTOWN4LIFE40 If he’s not impacting the outcome of the game, who gaf how many minutes he plays? His minutes have literally taken over everything. Is it the Houston Rockets or Houston Senguns?@HtownJ99 @mariuscojocaruu @HoustonRockets Thanks taking him away we would probably be 7-20 rn if we had him@RealGokTurk @c7haddad @HoustonRockets I literally never said he was the reason we down 30 wtf? I just said sengun hasn’t been perfect@c7haddad @sahteolmayan9 @J0ZlF @HoustonRockets Exactly, this has nothing to do with being Turkish or not. My guy gets benched when being the topscorer and being down by 30+.

Really gotta question that coaching staff @HoustonRockets@HoustonRockets Give us KMJ + Nwaba and we won’t embarass you in the 2nd half.@HtownJ99 @HoustonRockets sadly kpj was a problem for us he seems happy in houston and we are happy in the land too@HoustonRockets Perfect Alpi, sit on the bench now .@carlossgotit @HoustonRockets No I’m saying he literally left and went to the locker room@RealGokTurk @c7haddad @HoustonRockets Where did I say that? Show me brother@HoustonRockets sengun has to start in second half still has a game@sahteolmayan9 @RealGokTurk @c7haddad @HoustonRockets Exactly bro. Pointing out the flaws isn’t hating lmao he hasn’t been perfect@J0ZlF @c7haddad @HoustonRockets Literally no one was perfect. Of course he does some mistakes, but you really trynna blame the rookie that the Cavs are ahead 30+?@sahteolmayan9 @RealGokTurk @J0ZlF @HoustonRockets That's why we want more minutes, hes not gonna learn from the bench. Imagine he was getting 30 mins a game. He'd be in the ROTY conversation I have no doubt in my mind. He's already learning to stay out of foul trouble9-19 yessssssirrrrr

please not by 50 @HoustonRockets@mariuscojocaruu @6_rasean @HoustonRockets yeah but KPJ has legit star potential@HoustonRockets The best Offensive player was on the bench and he played only less than 10 minutes. ingenious@HoustonRockets Hey Rockets fans https://t.co/E8tYtSGszY@mariuscojocaruu @HoustonRockets Yeah that backcourt would have been scary fr@HtownJ99 @6_rasean @HoustonRockets okoro is really good his offensive game starting to improve@tony21292936735 @Houston923FM @YoItsKenneth @HoustonRockets The Warriors of course.@WoodFromRange @HoustonRockets + Never bench him@RealGokTurk @c7haddad @HoustonRockets I’m addressing “what has he done wrong”.like I said let’s not act like he was perfect either bro.

There’s no other explanation@HoustonRockets Stop doing sengun wrong WTF@6_rasean @mariuscojocaruu @HoustonRockets bruh what...@HoustonRockets Damn https://t.co/6mi3tEpnX4@carlossgotit @HoustonRockets In ya’ll defense Silas kinda left in the middle of the half@Tru_lio @c7haddad @HoustonRockets I agree@J0ZlF @c7haddad @HoustonRockets Uhhhh the 19 year young rookie who’s our topscorer with 9 points in 9 minutes has some turnovers

He’s playing like he’s wearing the jersey for 10+ years wym smh@Houston923FM @YoItsKenneth @HoustonRockets Aint like yall have a choice lol@J0ZlF @HoustonRockets I know he's not perfect but to only have 9 mins AGAIN after being the only player that can seemingly put the ball in the bucket is just so weird. Every game he has a positive impact on the court and he just gets benched,  the more he plays the better he will get@HtownJ99 @mariuscojocaruu @HoustonRockets Okoro is a better fit.@Sixteenhundo @HoustonRockets We definitely didn't want Allen. Y'all can take that contract if you want tho 🤷‍♂️@HoustonRockets POVERTY LMFAOOOOOO@okdawgg @c7haddad @HoustonRockets yeah tough game to watch for y’all, your healthy team is better than this but cavs at the moment are way better@HoustonRockets we won the Harden trade💀@HoustonRockets That’s not idealomw to the houston rockets page for the 2nd straight quarter https://t.co/8e9B8JwPMQ@HoustonRockets Ayo y’all good over here ?@HoustonRockets Only down by 31 at the half.
