I want the #Heat to get the 1 seed and have the East playoffs run through Miami. And I believe the #Nets will end up with the 7 seed and will play the 2.I don't want Brooklyn in the 1st round bc that's just an abnormally difficult 1st round series. 2nd or ECF? gladly will face them. but I don't want to have to grind out a 6-7 game series win against the Nets to face the Bucks who didn't even break a sweat sweeping the CavsOkay brooklyn owns the tiebreaker over us so technically we won’t be tied with them but still 

A win tomorrow and Brooklyn loss we are in a tied record wise with hornets and nets@Precision80 @Giannis_An34 @dariusgarland22 need a nets loss to tie us with brooklyn and give us the 8 seed. and need a cavs win so the hawks don’t tie us@KendrickPerkins All 5 of those teams fear the Brooklyn NetsSo, root for the Nets to help Miami get the 1 seed only to face Brooklyn in round 1? 

Or

Have Milwaukee take the 1 seed and avoid Brooklyn?
