#ValleyProud https://t.co/gPwUJ5pOBN@Migwell1231 @0nlyHoops @OfficialRomp that’s true but it’s more of a matchup nightmare for the warriors than for the suns. especially with their interior defense being average, and the grizzlies averaging the most paints in the point. so at this point and time i’m more scared of phoenix@jakezach01 @macwebb @_JasonLT Goran Dragic’s 36% for 3-pointers career stat would have been beneficial during the 2021 NBA Playoffs when the Phoenix Suns clogged the paint with 4 defenders, daring the Lakers to make WIDE OPEN 3-POINTERS. 😭😭😭The ties aren’t me, Thanos has been running the show his faves are playing ☀️@Suns &amp; @Bucks 🦌!

Atlanta Hawks 52%
Charlotte Hornets 51%If you love 90s Hip-Hop, Phoenix suns basketball &amp; are a kind person, we are already friends@Suns @efirstbank so glad we got him backQOTD: The correct answer from yesterday was D. Zhaire Smith. On June 21, 2018, Smith was selected with the sixteenth overall pick by the Phoenix Suns in the 2018 NBA draft, but was immediately traded, along with the Miami Heat's 2021 first round pick, to the Philadelphia 76ers https://t.co/0aEH07mxQc@mdamore4 The Coyotes must've been offered a BAD deal to use the Suns' arena again. Because they played there when they first arrived in Phoenix, and NHL hasn't ever been too particular about bad sightlines and obstructed views.
