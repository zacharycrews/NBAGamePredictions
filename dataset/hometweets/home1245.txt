Warriors were up 20 at the half, somebody in the coaching staff has to realize this and pull key guys from a meaningless game. Mavs were up 94 - 76 when Doncic goes down injured.@mcuban @DrHussainL @EricTopol @costplusdrugs @akesselheim @bnrome @AnnalsofIM @PORTAL_Research @dallasmavs @luka7doncic Basically you are the Costco (fixed margin) of drugs and don't even require a membership fee?

If each team is at 100% and the Mavs have home court advantage I think Dallas wins in 7.
