https://t.co/WltqubDruK https://t.co/CC7TtNDFEi@RussTakeover Did you not watch him in Houston? Outside of 3pt shooting that was the most efficient year of his career and then he got the torn quad in the playoffs and it bothered him all year in Washington… compared to Houston it’s regressed but he was hurt on the wizards all year ..Tyler Herro is questionable tonight vs. Washington.

Herro has missed only one game this season; The Heat won that game (against the Wizards) 112-97.Miami Heat vs Washington Wizards 11/20/2021 Picks Predictions Previews

Lakers the last sucker remaining. Only needed a veteran’s minimum PG with Catch &amp; Shoot ability.ITS GAMEDAY HEAT NATION 

we start a 4 game road trip tonight vs the washington wizards@TrentUSMNT @LFC Washington Wizards :)With a victory tonight, the Washington Wizards would improve to 11-5 and would equal their second-best start in franchise history after 16 games, per @bball_ref. These are the keys to tonight's rematch against the Miami Heat. (Click on the attached screen grab.) https://t.co/67i2IZYipTWhat game are you most excited for tonight?

My Picks are:

Miami Heat @ Washington Wizards
Charlotte Hornets @ Atlanta Hawks
Memphis Grizzlies @ Minnesota TimberwolvesWashington Wizards https://t.co/QmzPDjj0nn@WashWizards @NBATV @MuggsyBogues He played for the Washington Wizards, the Charlotte Hornets, Golden State Warriors and the Toronto Raptors, averaging 7.7 points a game.How Are The Washington Wizards The Best Team in the NBA?

I just falsified a deal with the Washington Wizards
The organization just gave me twenty million dollars https://t.co/MAW9tu0ktbThe Washington Wizards solid start is more of an indicator of  Westbrooks effect on a team, than the slow Lakers start.

The Lakers slow start highlights the weaknesses of Anthony Davis as the primary star, in my opinion5 plays for tonight

He should of stayed with the Wizards were there is no expectation. Fill up the stats and not make the playoffs and Washington fans are good with that, bcuz at least it was fun 😂.
