Good morning.Top 5 vs. Bottom 5 ATS matchup tonight in the #NBA 

Bulls 18-10 at home vs. Magic 12-17

Chicago is currently a 9 point favorite 

#GamblingTwitter https://t.co/TFBZm4ip9KThe UNDER is 37-16 in the last 53 meetings. The UNDER is 8-1 in the last nine meetings in Chicago. The UNDER is 6-0 in Magic last six vs. a team with a winning record. The UNDER is 22-7 in Bulls last 29 vs. a team with a losing record. Bet the UNDER in this game Tuesday.Tuesday's Free Pick: Magic/Bulls UNDER 222.5

This will be the 3rd meeting between the Orlando Magic and Chicago Bulls in less than a month. Familiarity favors defense and low-scoring games, and I look for this one to stay well UNDER the number tonight.chicagobulls: RT @bullscommunity: Our Chicago Luvabulls teamed up with Walter Payton College Prep's K-Pop dance group TAK for a routine they're performing tonight to celebrate Lunar New Year!

Always a few steps ahead.The Chicago Bulls are back in first place in the Eastern Conference! https://t.co/XRAnWlsRkSI better not hear another Maxey trade proposal either. That man is a better all around baller than Simmons and to include him in a trade to get… (clears throat) James Harden? I’ll take Maxeys upside. 

P.S I’m a @chicagobulls fan btw@LunaBulls @stablekwon @chicagobulls better endorse the 96 hoodie@sportssapphic Ah yes just like Chicago traded Pippen after the bulls pulled off their first threepeat 📠Burks had a great game!

I come from Poland and I would like to ask a question. I watch old NBA games and I am fascinated by the Chicago Bulls team from the 90s. Everyone talks about Jordan or Pippen but...I fell in love with Rodman. Is there a basketball player now who resembles him from the game?Let me say this.

That Last Dance documentary thing wasn't a docu-anything.

It was a one-sided Jordan infomercial &amp; everyone outside of Chicago knows that.

How hurt &amp; put off the Bulls players were by it should tell you Jordan lovers what kind of person Mike really is.
