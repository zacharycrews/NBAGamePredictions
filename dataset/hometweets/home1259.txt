#PhilaUnite https://t.co/5lZ8KxgRqc@arpan_on_BC It has nothing to do about being from Toronto the teams I root for are Raptors and the Jays, they’re typically loved throughout Canada.  I’m going to wager that you didn’t watch the games because you probably wouldn’t be making this about whatever your Toronto beef is.@raptors Game 4 could be final chance for the team or the start of something amazing. Tipoff just past 2 pm EDT. #WeTheNorth 
https://t.co/MvPIzpSGKU @canadian_xing@abomczak @Raptors Happy Birthday!!!!! 🎂🥳@Raptors @TangerineHoops I’ll actually be surprised if the Raptors lose this one, but they will definitely lose game 5. It’s probably a cheaper flight to LA from Philly than from Toronto for Nick Nurse.

#AllInWithAlleslev #LeadersMatter #WeTheNorthReports of Joel Embid playing are promising. But how will this affect his game and the 76ers chances to win on Saturday Can James Harden step up?

If they blow out @Raptors in G4 they’re winning the chip. Champions go for the kill.

Whereas if they come out flat and lose or barely win, it’s another 2nd round exit.

 Flat out the Sixers have outplayed the #Raptors. It's not the refs or certain fouls calls; #Toronto just stunk up the joint for 3 games.

#ScottieBarnes is doubtful for Game 4. Oh Boy. #NBA https://t.co/SE54pMsPV3@in4_raptors @SiakamSpinV2 If Kawhi suits up for @Raptors sure - 4-3. If FVV and Scottie Barnes have to play 40 minutes on one leg each because Malachi is the backup PG...No.Props for Raptors-Sixers Game 4 are listed. Joel Embiid is listed at O/U 31.5 points.

Initial reaction is to take the under. The injury is on his shooting hand. He has gone under 31.5 in four of six games played vs Toronto this season. https://t.co/jR5Q5tO73hI seriously want to say this. Toronto was getting beat before Scottie Barnes got hurt. He had 15 pts 10 rebs 8 asts. Gary Trent played 45 minutes. How are the Raptors that depleted because of a rookie?

https://t.co/DWnupIl68n@ANUNOBY3 @Raptors I mean I wish we kept Dewan as a centre but that didn't work out. If we can draft purposefully this year, we have an opportunity to make noise in the East.Our guy @lukegazdic is fading Kyle Lowry hard. The former Toronto Raptor has only put up 19 points in his first 2 games this post-season.

#Raptors #WeTheNorthJoel Embiid and the Sixers are "coming for the sweep" after capturing a 3-0 lead over the Toronto Raptors.

If they pull it off, this would be the franchise's first sweep since 1991.
