But I still trust in the team, so let's get this dub today!@markhaynesnba There shouldn’t be any controversy or issue about Steph starting. He is the superstar and the franchise of the @warriors.

He’s not a superstar, this playoff run proves it. Last year he got lucky, because you usually get better from one season to another. He got worse.I talk about this in my YouTube.  Poole must play through the contact (repeatedly) in order to eventually get consistent calls.  He can do it!

First round Knicks wasn’t anything to worry about, Philly chemistry was ruined with drama and Trae was historic . But these guys that are starting are reliant on the greatness of Trae.

#Warriors #Nuggets #NBA
https://t.co/sXBFX2D6vX@Highlighter84 @LuhJahs @ButtCrackSports @Money23Green @warriors @ATLHawks @TheTraeYoung It’s centered around Trae because who else is there? The warriors have a team where 2 other players can take over scoring duties for him, Curry always had a player that could average 20 and help with scoring, Trae doesn’t, Curry has people to run the offense Trae doesn’tGolden State Warriors should revert to original starting five

Please reply@warriors poole masterclass please https://t.co/NHl9kvjgGl@montserado @ChillAssDRe @ButtCrackSports @Money23Green @warriors @ATLHawks @TheTraeYoung Point is he got that contract being the best player ona team of nobodies. He didn’t have to do to much to earn that money that was gonna get paid to somebody anywayToday either we win or we win @warriors@Asher__Theodore @BabyKaiBzR @overtime @warriors nah fr tho.

They weren’t all stars the first year we won the title lol. Something about being one of the top teams in the NBA usually stamps 2-3 players as All Stars. Happened this year for the Warriors. Main reason why Wiggins got in.@VicLombardi @nuggets @warriors The lack of Tony Brothers on this list makes me extremely happy.@warriors Defend the ground@LuhJahs @jayvonchii @ButtCrackSports @Money23Green @warriors @ATLHawks @TheTraeYoung Two totally different offenses just because trae hits 3's don't make him steph trae offense is way more centered on him@ButtCrackSports @Money23Green @warriors @ATLHawks @TheTraeYoung facts Trey showed me he actually is too little@jamesange4 @ButtCrackSports @Money23Green @warriors @ATLHawks @TheTraeYoung they keep producin hall of famers@BamBam1A @warriors I listened to BamBam's Wheels Up.

https://t.co/pTdA3PLMIj@ChillAssDRe @ButtCrackSports @Money23Green @warriors @ATLHawks @TheTraeYoung They made the ECF last year. What are you talking about. They lost to the team that won the championship. 😂😂. Trae averaged 30ppg and 10ast in the playoffs last year as a 22 year old leading his team to the ECF.

Steph wasn’t a starter and that was on the coaches. Warriors had Monta Ellis at the time. It wasn’t until they traded him that Steph got the job full time. He also didn’t enter the league at 19. He played 3 years at Davidson.i shall sleep because @warriors have a game tomorrow, chase about to send nuggets home@skrizPO @VicLombardi @nuggets @warriors No Tony b or Scott foster could be worse!

https://t.co/2s26hRLjeI@finesse616 @ButtCrackSports @Money23Green @warriors @ATLHawks @TheTraeYoung They’re very different. Trae is ball dominant in a heliocentric offense. Steph plays off ball and picks defenses apart through movement and quick decision making when he has the ball.@ButtCrackSports @Money23Green @warriors @ATLHawks @TheTraeYoung @Money23Green at this point. Trae had to be the number 1 scorer and facilitator on his team. Curry has the luxury of having two players (Poole and your Yoursef) to start the offense. He had Poole and Klay to help out with scoring. Trae don’t have that so your point is done up@Dan_Lesage98 @ButtCrackSports @Money23Green @warriors @ATLHawks @TheTraeYoung Yeh what about him@ButtCrackSports @Money23Green @warriors @ATLHawks @TheTraeYoung @Money23Green I’m sorry when Curry played against the heat this season he shot 3/17 and had 9 points idec if the team won he had a bad game and his team has better parts.

I remember that series as Toronto is my favorite team.KD had to join the Warriors because he couldn't beat them in playoffs.Kd is overrated never won before or after golden State.Golden State won before him and they'll win again@iamjohnk2 @RetiredHoya @warriors i respect KD as a player &amp; person (from what i have observed and heard about him). he grew into manhood under the type of microscope none of us can imagine. he seems thoughtful &amp; perceptive. that’s why i’ve been pushing back in this convo on the idea he’s impulsive, entitled, etc@mamommascooking @Bandit_200 @KingVegetaback2 @ButtCrackSports @Money23Green @warriors @ATLHawks @TheTraeYoung kinda hard when steph being the most guarded throughout the entire season with double teams or more. n still manages to get his points@ButtCrackSports @Money23Green @warriors @ATLHawks @TheTraeYoung At the same age trae &gt; curry@Baz1ngo @KingVegetaback2 @Bandit_200 @ButtCrackSports @Money23Green @warriors @ATLHawks @TheTraeYoung Lebron was not in his prime@warriors, let today be a good day. https://t.co/PMO2m9CVSo@iamjohnk2 @RetiredHoya @warriors i don’t think it was an overreaction. KD went to what was already the best team and won titles that GS probably would have won without him. as a competitor and true hooper he must have understood on some level that those chips are questionable among a lot of us.Check out #GoldenStateWarriors #Hat - #NewEra9FIFTY #NBAHat #NBA #Basketball #Snapback Hat NWOT https://t.co/rtp1ZVBKi3 #eBay via @eBayDenver Nuggets vs  Golden State Warriors Prediction 4/27/22 - Free NBA P... https://t.co/LmvPubxrOy via @YouTube

That Cavs Team would‘ve smacked both teams yesterday. Heat even were missing two starters. 

But of course it was an underperformance from Steph, but comparing it to Traes stats from yesterday is blasphemous like Stephen A smith would sayIf any of my fans are looking for me, I’ll be at the @warriors playoff game tonight 😎

Taking a break from Twitter until everyone settles down 

Go Dubs!ANBA Golden State Warriors develops growth plan, includes NFT realm https://t.co/d7BEmosTIO w/@DNASportsTalk hopefully the @ATLHawks realize the experiment to become the @warriors of the east has failed and they look to build a team a more traditional way.@maxkellerman @KeyJayandMax look at @KDTrey5 career as a whole. He’s never been the guy when it counts. He choked when the @okcthunder were up 3-0 on @warriors then joined that team to get all his rings, now can’t win a series with the @BrooklynNets@KingVegetaback2 @goatedmanager @Baz1ngo @ButtCrackSports @Money23Green @warriors @ATLHawks @TheTraeYoung I’m the one being logical, Steph wasn’t good by no means not by his standards. Only he knows how much that injury affected him. 
I’m just saying comparing 11 points 15% FG with 9FTs to 17 points 33% 1FT is ridiculous. Sounds like an agenda to meI need a Jordan Poole @warriors jersey and a @javy23baez  @tigers  jersey…it’s been decided!@KDTrey5 @WorldWideWob KD won’t tell you this the real reason he left the @warriors lol @rihanna hurt his feelings 😂 https://t.co/y6K75sPc5mIf @warriors win today, they’re the only team in the west who finished Round 1 in 5 games.

Crazy techMikal Bridges played the most minutes in the NBA this year. He's bright eyed and bushy tailed.

The Nuggets are older. Joker has miles on him. COULD he play 46 minutes? Sure. Is it smart to do that against the Golden State Warriors? Hell no. https://t.co/f2kLDWnJG4@jasontbattle @warriors @Oracle Ok it's just a posture corrector.

1. Boston Celtics
2. Miami Heat 
3. Golden State Warriors
4. Phoenix Suns
5. Memphis Grizzlies@jessewashington @RetiredHoya @warriors The thing is, KD likes to portray himself as someone who doesn’t give a rip about “perception”. If that were true, he wouldn’t feel the need to leave and win on his own.
I think he cared too much about the outside noise while at GSW, and overreacted and left.Look at that @warriors ! Phoenix can play big if they needed to…..NEW episode of Pickaxe and Roll with @NBABlackburn:

Plus, the Nuggets aren’t down bad like some NBA teams right now. https://t.co/epmd9Nm1N5@KDTrey5 look I'm not going to lie. Those Championships with @warriors are forever going to be looked upon as a fixed ring but when you can't get it done in @okcthunder and @BrooklynNets, just means you are a good rider and not driver. @StephenCurry30 was the Driver in GSW@AGumulia @warriors it’s a burner account dummy. i didn’t even expect followers to begin with lmao@Timberwolves and @memgrizz just fighting for the right to get whooped by the Dubs... on god 😂😂😂

@Timberwolves get you a smart point guard.@RingzSeason22 @warriors @memgrizz I’m not scared of them. Inexperienced team.@JohnFricke this is how i judge the Atlanta Hawks. How many of our players would start on the golden State warriors. Hell, only like 4 would be on the roster. Hawks just don't have the talent and coaching. Hopefully we get zion in the off-seasonAfter the @warriors Win this Title this year. I am Completely done with this FAKE ASS NBA LEAGUE AND INFLUENCED OFFICIALS.@warriors vs @memgrizz is inevitable. Either I'm confident or scared.@ghouIsy lmaooooo @warriors@iExCLuSiVe_Op @KDTrey5 The Golden State Warriors did it pre KD@QuillionWatts this is wack ball neither one of these teams can beat @warriorsWhat sucks is that I love watching the @memgrizz play basketball, It is so beautiful to watch!
