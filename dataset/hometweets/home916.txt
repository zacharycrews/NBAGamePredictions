Have faith.Didn’t chose to come here? I was with you on board the whole time with that we would get something good 4 Ben. I can’t wait until Brooklyn realizes what they got in Simmons.

Harden had to play with nobodies for 1 week then decided to bounce@BrooklynNets This is dumber than @LeoDiCaprio calling everyone “Old Sport” in The Great Gatsby .. Let @KyrieIrving ball 🏀 #FreeKyrie https://t.co/92iGddYP85@BrooklynNets so the nationally televised games has two former Nets as their analyst and you can’t get either one on your games Smh terrible.RT @BrooklynNets: “We were all locked in and we got to see the results tonight.” 

New episode of The Bridge drops tomorrow at 9 am ET 👀 https://t.co/74AvLJBeHk@BrooklynNets delete the harden one but still a WWI don’t miss @BenSimmons25 .. good luck with that @BrooklynNets https://t.co/Xu2vgls6fN@bob3919 @BrooklynNetcast @JHarden13 Yes I did, that could have been us but Kyrie is part time and @BrooklynNets fans blame everybody but him.Watching Nets last night, just feels like Milwaukee didn’t have the POA defense you’d think Brooklyn lacksAlways nice to see 🙌🏽 @BrooklynNets https://t.co/Nwp1vvD7yl@GFan89 @BrooklynNets @sixers @AnthonyLGargano Like I said coming from a fanbase that he never wanted to be with in the first place. He is with Morey now and will never betray him.@report_court @CozyLito @HawksDraftNerd @Alley_Oop_Coop @NBATradeGuy @BryceHendrick14 @qkhoops @H00P_Talk @HunterCruse14 @tankathon With the 24th pick in the 2022 NBA Draft, the Brooklyn Nets select Walker Kessler from Auburn. 

At 7-1, Kessler provides much needed rim protection for BKN as they chase a title, while developing into a possible floor spacer in the future. https://t.co/OEVQn8hIesHow many more L's as NY sports fan are we gonna get ? The Brooklyn Nets don't count they might as well be visitors.#KyrieIrving!! @kyrieirving will most likely NOT BE CLEARED to play in #Brooklyn even after a relaxed mandate on vaccinations!! #NBA #NoWinForKyrie @brooklynnets @nba #Basketball 🏀 https://t.co/olMN3qv77M@FinalsKyrie @BrooklynNets They lost to kessler edwardsIf I’m the Brooklyn Nets I am letting Kyrie play. Enough is enough with all the hypocrisy. What are they going to do? Fine us? Go for it. Take their asses to court. They let everyone else go about their business besides Kyrie?? GTFOHGreat couple days for @BrooklynNets Celtics lose, Hornets lose (1 team right ahead &amp; below them in the standings) &amp; Nets win vs Bucks now play another team right ahead of them back to back nights the Raptors ! Lets get a W tmm vs them &amp; then hopefully KD comes back for 2nd game@_demonsndollars @Atlanti11448522 @BrooklynNets And Blake what??James Harden gave us glimpse of what we got all too little of with ...

I guess a winning environment cures everything because players are listening to him on the Dallas Mavericks when he speaks and he is back to playing his game that we saw with the Brooklyn Nets.@clutchfans I feel the Rockets need to find a pure point in draft and move Green to small forward and KPJ off the ball. Hopefully the Brooklyn Nets pick ends up top 10 along with our 1 2 or #3 pick.@Tony994445271 @Arun30384 @JayLGK @Rob24282840 @BrooklynNets 76ers in 4 https://t.co/50HEDBcyYZCongratulations to Sircano91 (@Ccano91), RareKitties (@rarekitties), rayminbi (@rayminbi), brballer, clegainz (@clegainz), willh and Evo who moved up to take #4, #5, #6, #7, #8, #9 and #10 on the Brooklyn Nets team leaderboard.

https://t.co/8yzss9CSSP@BrooklynNets   Pay the fine https://t.co/buzmQ7WgP3@BrooklynNets @joetsai1999 The Brooklyn nets should just play Kyrie once the general vaccine mandate has been lifted.  This has gone beyond nonsense.You fucked up @nba @BrooklynNets https://t.co/8nYS5TCnvf@BrooklynGuy2021 @MikeKing00 take my money Brooklyn Nets@ShamsCharania The mandate is stupid because visiting players who are unvaccinated can play but kyrie can't. Don't get me wrong kyrie is selfish and not a leader but it's not fair to the nets when antivax guys like jonathan isaac beal josh richardson and others could still play in Brooklyn.The Clippers improved to 32-31 with the win.

LA goes over .500 for the first time since January 1st, when they defeated the Brooklyn Nets to improve to 19-18.Tonight on @SportsFinal4NY - “The Capper,” @TimCapstraw joins me to talk @BrooklynNets basketball!

Ben Simmons stay losing like a L. Brooklyn Nets stay losing in the playoffs. Ben is trash.We got a spot for you @KingJames @BrooklynNets team up with KD https://t.co/NkqXKsHz3S@aresburner @HenienKarim @SamHoweII @BleacherReport @BrooklynNets The sixers have gotten so much better to where they are now championship contenders. So Houston got better when he left? OKC? They were the favorites when he was on the Nets lol. Looks like every team gets worse that he leaves#BenSimmons for #JamesHarden. Wonder if #CharlesBarkley thinks the @BrooklynNets still got the better deal. 😂😂😂@Sixers #Sixers #HereTheyCome https://t.co/sWdGekrP7J@BLCity5 @ILoveLukaMagic @BrooklynNets @NYPost_Lewis @KyrieIrving He’s asked us both to.

Zack Britton said it wasn’t true on Twitter, and I think he’d be in the know.@LRubinson @WFAN660 @SBondyNYDN @nyknicks @BrooklynNets @KenDavidoff Please ask if Leon Rose has any semblance of a plan?@davdavies @BrooklynNets Yes its better harden go because he is liability its not an asset... may be he plan that way so that he avoid the nets but he cannot avoid the nets a healthy nets cannot lost in 7 game vs sixers... good plan by Mr. Best actor.@BrooklynNets @AndreDrummond Love me some drum drum upset we had to give him up but u go get it son@LRubinson @WFAN660 @SBondyNYDN @nyknicks @BrooklynNets @KenDavidoff If there's no agreement reached what happens next? Will they keep negotiating?@FinalsDurant I never said he didn’t your Brooklyn nets fan base the one who act like he never had a hood game and holding him back because Kevin let his friendship with kyrie and the fact kyrie said he wiling to retire if traded stop him from letting nets trade kyrie@LRubinson @SBondyNYDN @WFAN660 @nyknicks @BrooklynNets @KenDavidoff Yes ask them..why do we start and finish our games without a PG..@LRubinson @WFAN660 @SBondyNYDN @nyknicks @BrooklynNets @KenDavidoff I'll be thereI'll be on @WFAN660 tonight from 11 pm to 2am. We'll start with your calls and then have 2 guests. Guests are: @SBondyNYDN on #Harden, @nyknicks and @BrooklynNets. And @KenDavidoff on #MLB lockout.  do you have any questions you want me to ask Ken or Stefan? I'll pick one to askIt's clear at this point that Kyrie playing home games for the Brooklyn Nets is happening, and soon. Barring any catastrophic event (it's still America, after all), we're going to see it. 

Which makes me wonder, if this announcement came 3 weeks ago -- does Harden still bail?Drummond di @Lakers dan @BrooklynNets #NBA75 #LakersNation #LakeShow #NetsWorld https://t.co/oeD348YbxSFAWK THAT @BrooklynNets LET KYRIE PLAY ANYWAYS, FAWK THEM POLITICIANS!!

I have no love for the Nets, but he did them the same way he's done every team he's played for. And he sucks in the playoffs.

 #Brooklyn_NetsAnyone know if the vaccine mandate being dropped on 3/7 would include fans attending Nets games at the Barclays?! #BrooklynNets #Nba@barryisthedon What he means is today's players are soft and while @Giannis_An34 knows with most teams, (maybe not @BrooklynNets), he can drive up the gut to score at will, it would have been harder with NBA teams of  yesteryear, and that includes 60s/70s @Bucks.@BrooklynNets @NBA @NBAPR it's time guys. Pay the fine and let Kyrie play. Clarification from @Fabien_Levy is not only a jackass, terrible way to deliver this news but alsl absolute BS. Kyrie can practice, warm up, sit in the stands, but not play.
