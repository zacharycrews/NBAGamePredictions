It’s for a friend…@FanDuel Charles Barkley for Phoenix, Shaq for Orlando and Magic for the Lakers.  Having Nash and Penny is comical.  Kobe has a case but Magic meant way more to the franchise and was a better player so he’s their GOAT.@AmicoHoops Hope this goes better than the mighty Orlando Magic facing the Cavs without their top players. #GoCavs@OrlandoMagic @devin_cannady3 @PrincetonMBB @LakelandMagic @nbagleague Awesome news.

#MagicTogether https://t.co/hv7x8kIhMd@enticingsnake @Sixers_Matt I’m a Magic fan and Kobe was my favorite player once Tmac forced his way out of Orlando. But that doesn’t mean I’ll go out of my way to argue Kobe is better than Lebron when it’s simply not true. Embiid has a better case than Giannis.

Orlando magic
NY KnicksDevin Cannady's 10-day contract with the Orlando Magic expired today.

Orlando may be able to re-sign Cannady for today's final game by petitioning for a hardship. Or the Magic could sign Cannady to rest-of-season contract or multi-year deal.@RyanGreen1010XL today is the last day of the regular season for the Orlando Magic while I am sad to season is coming to an end I know that the franchise is headed back in the right direction we have great young Talent and I believe we are ready to make the move next year@great_brains @Pacers @DetroitPistons @OrlandoMagic By the way, love your banner on your page - I love succession!@great_brains @Pacers @DetroitPistons @OrlandoMagic No thanksGame 82!

Oh wait…@frankdegods I feel you. Been a huge Shaq fan for a long time. Like Orlando Magic days with Penny Hardaway long. 

Wow, this is epic! https://t.co/HQr02WGFiJ@WalrusTM I was at the Orlando game, and while I know it’s the Magic, the way Mitch and Sims would sub for each other and continue the dominance in the paint and on the glass was incredible. And of course the way RJ, Obi, and IG played together was also something to marvel at. What a core.@tg_bennett @OilersNation Orlando Magic also comes to mind now.#MIAvsORL
