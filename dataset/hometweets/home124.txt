Thank you to our fantastic staff, aka Magic Makers, our dragontastic PTA, and the Orlando Science Center for all your hard work to make it happen. @Southeast_OCPS @johannaocps @OCPSnews @alelivaz https://t.co/gyjoUk38Lp1) I cannot help but notice the San Antonio spurs are in town for a marquee matchup against the Orlando magic tomorrow night. I will not support anything this far liberal, white guilt all star team member and white apologist Greg Poppovich does. “Pop” is a pinko liberal with his https://t.co/xiULoUxTe8@Community_Magic @OrlandoMagic  @AlomaElem successfully completed the 4 week Magic Fit Challenge! 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻💪🏻💪🏻💪🏻 https://t.co/KlgJYpz16UMiss you @mickeymouse !!! #tbt #mickey #waltdisney #waltdisneyworld #orlando #orlandoflorida #trip ❤️ em Magic Kingdom https://t.co/WStUCU1qY9Celtics doing to the @MiamiHEAT in the 2nd quarter what they did in the 3rd quarter to the @OrlandoMagic last night. https://t.co/xSqM3s5uKgLast night we held the trash Orlando Magic to 79 points through the entire game. Tonight, we’re on pace to hold the 6-1 Miami Heat to just 66 points.☘️ https://t.co/HHfctB0gE0I didn't think it was possible for another team ( @MiamiHEAT ) to put up as bad a quarter as the @OrlandoMagic did last night #NBA #MiamiHeat@HeatvsHaters We look like the orlando magic 😎Also coming soon.

After four seasons as Manchester United head coach, Gregg Popovich returns to the NBA and the San Antonio Spurs in a bid to become the most winning-est coach in the NBA. Kicking off the season against the Orlando Magic.

T Mac was there when I was about 5-8 years old, he made me love basketball and the Magic.@HoopsTalk13 @JonnaDeOlive @OMagicHQ @OrlandoMagic Just enjoy watching him from the sideline. Still has 3 years left and no PO 😏One box yields Gold and Photon 👏👏👏 #coleanthony #orlandomagic #rookie #rookiecard #ratedrookie #ssp #jimmybutler #miamiheat /10 #donrussoptic #opticbasketball #paniniamerica #whodoyoucollect #nba #basketball https://t.co/N3uHmukQx5@bob4punk @BostonCeltics @OrlandoMagic I’m 47. Those teams were the best. I started rooting hard in the ‘86-‘88 range. Can’t give up.@MayorTooliani @BostonCeltics @OrlandoMagic I can't wait for the Knicks to be good again, I used to love the mid-90s knicks.... basketball is better when they are doing good@MayorTooliani @BostonCeltics @OrlandoMagic 100% agree there!@bob4punk @BostonCeltics @OrlandoMagic I’m not up to speed on what happened btw Smart, Tatum and Brown but it’s on my radar. That team is underperforming it’s talent.@MayorTooliani @BostonCeltics @OrlandoMagic It was close until halftime then they blew it open. And yes sports are very much like the stock market in the sense you think you have a slam-dunk winner and then it turns sideways on youRemember that the ownership group for the Orlando magic commits war crimes and crimes against humanity through their private military.@bob4punk @BostonCeltics @OrlandoMagic Magic beat my Knicks at MSG 2 days after the Knicks mauled them in O-Town. I would have laid the wood on that not happening. Isn’t there some infighting btw Smart, Tatum and Brown right now. Not trying to talk you out of it tho. 🤷‍♂️@JohnDenton555 @SixthManShow @TheAthleticNBA @OrlandoMagic @AP @TheAthleticNBA John is the perfect fit to be our new Orlando Magic beat writer.

Is the process! Patience and results will start coming. The switching from Boston was with lots of energy involved, so there is some job to do with shape and dynamics of our team in order to get the ball back. Look forward to next game. The future look bright.
