The team isn’t able to practice regularly during the pandemic either, leaving new recruits playing catch-up. https://t.co/kpHVm9uiYw@KeviKev88 @trailblazers @Alexancooper @hhsocialwork @sleepesoteric @rosecityboii Thanks Kev I’ll already be here!

https://t.co/BYEF9AWji2@JJRahKay @TheNBACentral @trailblazers Indeed like Reggie Miller. He Should have left after 10 yrs also or insisted on better players. He was content with Being ’The Man’ and less on the focus of winning a ring.@trailblazers @utahjazz @ModaCenter @RipCityRadio620 Will be interesting to see how many points Rudy Gobert will have against us without a center. O/U 40?@trailblazers @utahjazz @ModaCenter @RipCityRadio620 Y’all got this!

I don’t think a ton of ARMY understand how big of a moment this is for us 😂 2 very significant and important things to me colliding like this… I can’t handle it. I’d love to see Dame/Blazers gain worldwide ARMY respect, and Suga/BTS gain more sports fans respect!@TomerAzarly @trailblazers @Dame_Lillard he just put out a genuine, heartfelt statement is all. dont twist his intentions thanks@bts__jen @trailblazers @Dame_Lillard @BTS_twt @bts_bighit dead ass😂😂✋😭@kookiebutttter @trailblazers @Dame_Lillard @BTS_twt @bts_bighit the iconic wave omg ugh the basketball fanatic in me is literally shaking so is the ARMY in meHey @trailblazers my daughter would love to give these pictures to the team/players. Is there any way we can do that?  Drop them off or in the mail?  Making these pictures has honestly helped her 10 year old heart so much.@onigiridorkk @Pheeeeeeeebs1 @trailblazers @Dame_Lillard @BTS_twt @bts_bighit dead ass same dame is such a humble player he wouldn't do jack for clout he loves the game and the ppl that support him and that's that just like bts@trailblazers @Dame_Lillard @BTS_twt @bts_bighit being and NBA fan and BTS fan this just ughh make me so happy. we need a damedolla and agust d collab 😂😂✋@trailblazers @Dame_Lillard @BTS_twt @bts_bighit Omg 😍 You are very amazing Damian thank you for this message for SUGA ❤️🏀🏀@UrsulaFriends @bybyeong @trailblazers @Dame_Lillard @BTS_twt @bts_bighit How do you feel tricked though? Dame *himself* is not asking anyone in this video to vote for him; it’s a personal message he’s hoping to get out to Yoongi. It’s the Blazers media that posted this in support of both Dame and BTS. Dame is THE most honest person in the NBA league@trailblazers @BTSdailyinfo @Dame_Lillard @BTS_twt @bts_bighit i hope this reaches suga 🥺 @BTS_twt @bts_bighit@trailblazers @Dame_Lillard @BTS_twt @bts_bighit no more dream suga 🏀
