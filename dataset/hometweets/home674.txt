4. CIA-funded violent coups of leftist leaders in South America
These are just a few examplesThe Golden State Warriors love running this action. Get your best scorer open or isolated on the wing.

The Black July riots gave enough evidence against Sinhala rioters for Tamils to complain. Although riots was government sponsored. Sinhala military was guilty of many atrocities well documented against Tamils in North-East from 1983 even after war ended.@TaylorRooks I mmmmmeeeeeeeeeeaaaannnn Kyrie definitely has a point i mean that was against the golden state warriors they had the best record in nba history and they came back to beat them in a series yeah them cav fans is motherfucking ungrateful@BamBam1A BamBam is going to perform on M Countdown but he still doesn't forget about his side job of making Golden State Warriors win 😭 BamBam..a dub nation said to make the L in capital letter

@KlayThompson @warriorsKlay Thompson Leads Warriors in Scoring for the First Time Since 2019 . After more than 2 years away following surgery and recovery, Klay Thomson now leads the Golden State Warriors in scoring. This... https://t.co/qTISiKf3IR@warriors co-owner and billionaire @chamath is facing internet outrage after declaring that “nobody cares” about the plight of the persecuted #Uyghur ethnic Muslim minority in China’s far west #Xinjiang region. https://t.co/f0DMSYN08N@warriors Greatest defender of this Era and the most unique and unselfish player of all time.
#DraymondGreen ll #NBAAllStar@NickSwagyPYoung Stop it. Lakers might not even make playoffs. @Suns or @warriors would run @Lakers out Gym if they played in playoffs that is if the Lakers actually make the playoffs. Lakers needs to concentrate on just trying to make the "Play in" tournament &amp; not teams clearly at top of NBA@warriors Why are you tweeting so late, gotta post these pre game or during the game@AlwisInoka @tomhaverford24 @chamath @warriors Point I am making is that in 1981, when Chamath was 5 years there was NO JVP or LTTE threat for Sinhala Buddhist 2 flee to Canada. I live in Los Angeles since 1983, N many used JVP uprising as an excuse 2 apply 4 refugee status which could never be verified. Desperate Tamils too.During a #TV discussion #billionaire investor @chamath said he didn’t care about #Uyghurs and nor do most #Americans. Following #socialmedia backlash, he apologized.

They are being rounded up for a reason. How short our memory is. Just wait long enough they will raise hell again in US and Europe.@warriors Loved seeing Steph and LeBron on the same team during this game.@SwitchGlitchmon @llb_877 @NevaPopAPressy @SaftyKuma @michaelsobolik @warriors @chamath You see no difference between making convicted felons who received due process work and enslaving the Uyghur? No difference between having facilities to hold foreigners who illegally entered our country and genocide?

Enjoy the inexpensive shoes and phones I guess.@caseyvitelli @StephenCurry30 @KDTrey5 @NBA @NBAAllStar @warriors @BrooklynNets @Jumpman23 @unimockups These are pretty slick@jediandjerms Problem is that the @warriors and @Suns are better this year than last year
#UtahJazz@warriors I just have one wish if Steph will not be the captain. It is for him and Lebron on one team again. I am warriors fan but I say that they do have a chemistry but sadly people think they are rivalry.

#StephenCurry #NBAAllStar@AuPropaganda Kentucky, Georgia, Golden State Warriors, it makes no difference, Auburn by 50🅿️🦚@NickSwagyPYoung I beg to differ.  A healthy @warriors team won't have a problem with that.@Jason @michaelsobolik @warriors @chamath It's far worse than that.  He refuses to speak separately about China and the U.S. and therefore equates us.  His point is NOT that we need to take care of our own..it is a shield for China, suggesting that we can't try to stop their GENOCIDE if we don't have enough black CEOs.@Rsashimi12 @warriors Tell Kerr please@warriors approved by the king 🌝@normy11 @johnnyRyall11 @MSTalokonnikoff @michaelsobolik @warriors @chamath You're still going on and on, so clearly you take this very seriously. If only you were serious about your "activism" &amp; "egalitarianism "  

But why do all this show? For likes? To score chicks? Or to feel better than others by telling yourself lies?

Good luck, anyway. Carry on@jkubatko @warriors Forgot another fact in the tweet.
#NBAAllStar #AndrewWiggins@warriors So good So cool #StephenCurry #NBAAllStarThe @NBA @warriors @chamath @SteveKerr are all hypocritical whores. China is their pimp. They don't care about human rights atrocities against the #Uyghurs nor what's alleged against African Americans for that matter.

It was injustice o.k.a thoughts and attitudes. While the King was in prison, it is my firmly held belief that he was throwing a lot of thoughts and attitudes belonging to fellow Americans into the ethereal jail.@warriors @beck good song! https://t.co/kpeXOJRshP What’s being thrown in Jail? Truisms may sound new, but they’ve been said before. I say it because it makes me feel good and it’s nice to be accompanied by truth at this present hour. So what’s being thrown in jail you may ask?I don’t want to talk about the Jazz anymore so…
