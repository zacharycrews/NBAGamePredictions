We also went to the Orlando Magic game and went on an airboat alligator tour.  That was fun!The starting lineups for tonight's matchup between the Nets and Magic in Orlando ⬇️

#NETSonYES https://t.co/DMZFX1O6fZGood evening everyone!🍺

First SGP is for Nets vs Magic. Thought about adding a player from Orlando but I just didn’t find a spot I liked. The Magic played the 76ers tough as double-digit dogs so I’m hoping they can do the same tonight. KD and Kyrie take over and cash us out!🤘 https://t.co/Xi7dMXTIcjNot much from me today...

I can only hope he balls out next year HEALTHYNets PG Kyrie Irving gets the start tonight in Orlando vs. Magic along with Goran Dragic.

Here’s Brooklyn starting 5:

Irving, Dragic, Kevin Durant, Bruce Brown and Andre Drummond. 

This is Brooklyn’s 39th different starting lineup, a season record.Goran Dragic will start in place of Seth Curry (ankle) alongside Kyrie Irving, Kevin Durant, Bruce Brown and Andre Drummond tonight against the Orlando Magic. Interesting decision by Steve Nash to start Dragic over Patty Mills.The Nets starting 5️⃣ against the Magic in Orlando: Irving, Dragic, Durant, Brown and Drummond.

The Magic starting 5️⃣: Cole Anthony, RJ Hampton, Franz Wagner, Wendell Carter Jr., and Mo Bamba.NBA Live Thread: Brooklyn Nets at Orlando Magic, 7:00 PM EST https://t.co/34Dd4nXvZI https://t.co/VV3JMziIy7Uniforms for Brooklyn Nets vs Orlando Magic at 4:00 PM.

Van Gundy then put Jameer BACK which DESTROYED the chemistry!@TraviesoAndrew @OrlandoMagic I don’t think that’s it. They were just very transparent, announced he’s shut down till next season and gave honest interviews.

@MountainDew x #MagicTogether https://t.co/QJijkFEbEn@OrlandoMagic @JJudahIsaac I would’ve appreciated this information months ago, thanks anyway though.The Nets are 6-0-1 ATS in the last seven games on the road. 

Tonight, they play the Magic in Orlando. The Nets are -10.5. 

WHO ARE YOU GUYS TAKING??March 15, 1995: New Jersey’s Derrick Coleman had 36 PTS (14-21 FG) &amp; 11 REB in a 108-99 win over Orlando.

Shaquille O’Neal led the Magic (48-16) with 34 PTS &amp; 17 REB. The Nets improved to 26-37.

Isaac tore his left ACL on Aug. 2, 2020.

He is in year one of a four-year $69.6M extension.  🤕  #NBA #NBATwitterLive #Magic (Via @BobbyMarks42)So @OrlandoMagic fans preach patience with a multi-year rebuild, but the obvious move of taking Isaac’s rehab slow is unacceptable?

Magic: 33-36 

Best bet for this one? https://t.co/pSiWWesCPsThe Orlando Magic have released a statement reporting that Jonathan Isaac will still miss the remainder of this season. 

The young star hasn't played an NBA game since tearing his ACL during the Disney bubble of 2020.

(via @davidaldridgedc) https://t.co/JzP9SORFkm@JFurKSL No lie, I went to a Sixers game vs. Orlando when I was about 15 (I admit I was briefly on the Magic bandwagon). The Philly fans booed him (duh) in the lineup intros. He then proceeded to outplay Shaq and left to a standing ovation in the 4th.This kid really played himself into the starting Pg spot. @OrlandoMagic have to figure out what the other guards fit in rotation next season once guys come back healthy. But Cole can’t be moved to the bench https://t.co/2dIlV9WZuW@mattnewts I look at Mitch stint in Chicago like if the 1992 Orlando Magic told Shaq to stay exclusively on the perimeter &amp; shoot 3's instead of easy dunks in the post. Nagy seems like he was here to show what Mitch couldn't do instead of showing what he could do.The @OrlandoMagic covered the spread against the @sixers but ultimately lost by two points &amp; @BrooklynNets is clinging to eighth place in the East after narrowly edging out the @nyknicks

A point I know all too well growing up in Orlando being a Magic fan https://t.co/p9sbBPagwrJonathan Isaac says he’s frustrated. Jeff Weltman says he doesn’t look at it that way. But nobody @OrlandoMagic is happy that @JJudahIsaac is missing this entire season. https://t.co/9PzKodTYXKNow that Jonathan Isaac has been officially shut down this season... we're looking at 800+ days between his last game for the Orlando Magic (Aug. 2, 2020)... and his next.@Max_Van_Auken @OrlandoMagic @BrooklynNets Awesome...The  #NetsWorld  are 6-0-1 Against the spread in their last 7 games on the road.

But what’s gonna happen is he’s gonna play 15 games and then hurt himself again cuz he’s made of glass. BUT STILL you don’t waive a guy you’re paying a fat contract too. Makes no senseJalen Suggs will not play tonight in the @OrlandoMagic’s home game against the @BrooklynNets. R.J.

It’s a lost season anyways so let him come back to play next year after adding another top 5 pick to this young core and we’ll be nasty. It’s nonsensical what you propose we do@NBATurkiye Hedooo orlando magic@FOX35Adam @fox35orlando @OrlandoMagic Sell the team.
