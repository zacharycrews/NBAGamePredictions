What can we get from SGA tonight? What about OKC’s young players. What do we get from Green tonight? More about looking towards the future.

Tonight's game against a young, but talented, Thunder team will give us better insight as to what to expect from a lot of these younger guys on the Houston Rockets.It's clear @BenSimmons25 wants to be in Houston, @malika_andrews, @ABCGMA3 , @dmorey , @HoustonRockets . https://t.co/mX7OlKVdPh@ansatsusha80 @kb81244 @JJMaples55_MST James Harden pulled a “sneak move,” used the Lakers to make his teammates so mad at him that they would never want him back in their locker room. If the Houston Rockets beat the Lakers that game, NO TRADE.@ansatsusha80 @kb81244 @JJMaples55_MST Be decisive and make the trade earlier instead of procrastinating. 😄😄😄
That way there is no chance for the Lakers to blow the Houston Rockets out so bad that James Harden explodes on his teammates. https://t.co/vzxggGMJPpIt's the #Rockets Home Opener TONIGHT

Back at the 50 year anniversary, Drexler caused some controversy by being announced: 'From the Houston Rockets'. Maybe Clyde will balance the scales and present as a Blazer this go around.@jimmybuxbux @darrenrovell @HoustonRockets @karbachbrewing Too bad MJ was in the league when the Rockets beat the Magic in the finals. Not Houston’s fault MJ couldn’t beat Shaq 🤷🏻‍♂️Ben Simmons to Houston for John Wall to Philly. Make this happen and everybody wins, because the respective systems work for both players.
@JohnWall @JoelEmbiid @HoustonRockets @sixers @NBAonTNTThe Houston Rockets Zhou Qi had a blind fold on during the game.How is this station supposedly the "Houston Sports Leader" when @SportsTalk790 has the #1 team flagship in the @astros and flagship of the @HoustonRockets and @UHouston and has @SportsMT . @SportsRadio610 only had that football feeling @HoustonTexans. https://t.co/nk1TnTLl1lA lot of teams are getting spanked 👀 @NBA @HoustonRockets@karbachbrewing @HoustonRockets Hook up a lifetime rockets fan from So. Illinois!?If the 90's Houston Rockets had played in New York City, Otis Thorpe and Sam Cassell would be on the #NBA75 list.@ddpage369 @RooshWilliams @_JasonLT He played against Houston with no names then an injured PG against the jazz then with the rockets played against LAL on one leg
