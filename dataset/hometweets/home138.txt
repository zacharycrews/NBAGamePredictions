Why not? Because the stampede would have been far worse than the shooting.To all my Toronto Raptors fans, if you’re reading this? Kevin Durant will drop 50+ points, possibly breaking his record for most points in a game. The undisputed GOAT will put an end to your poverty franchise. Mark my words.Last time Brooklyn Nets Kevin Durant was in The Toronto Raptors Arena he had 11 pts 3-3 from The 3 point line &amp; 1 block before getting injured https://t.co/BeB8uKGvnR"PRE GAME: Chicago Bulls (2-6) vs. Toronto Raptors (5-4) (November 7, 2017)"

I've loved the Raps for years because

1. Noone wants to go there (Idk why, TOR is a 🔥 city)
2. The NBA doesn't market them enough
3. You won a chip in 2019#NEWBLOOD-NEWSFLASH!
F.S.U. was the only school with 3 NBA Draft Lottery picks in the 2020 &amp;2021 NBA Drafts( Patrick Williams, #4 overall by Chicago &amp; Devin Vassell, #11 overall by San Antonio in 2020 while Scottie Barnes was taken #4 in the 2021 NBA Draft by the Toronto Raptors.Okay excited af before the game... Don't really know what's gonna happen. OG on KD / Scottie on Harden, let's hope he doesn't make mistakes. Would be an interesting matchup defensively and offensively. #WeTheNorth #raptorsnets #Toronto #Raptors #NetsWorldBrooklyn Nets @ Toronto Raptors
