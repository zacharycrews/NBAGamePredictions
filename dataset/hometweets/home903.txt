Still hard to believe how Suns &amp; Raptors lost by such a big difference to such ass teams like Hornets &amp; Pelicans respectively. 😶

#bettingsports1U Heat -7.5 (-110)

Both teams are on a B2B, but the Spurs just played a double OT game where there were 310 total points scored and now have to travel down to Miami in less than 24 hours to play the Heat.He just scored 40+ on the Miami heat lmao fuck what they talking bout https://t.co/VfSGh6IfwDMy new favorite teams: (in no particular order other than #1)

5. @MiamiHEAT@LondonoCiro1990 @complexzone @LeBronfactcheck Miami went back to the playoffs the 2nd year after Lebron left. Wade and Bosh were both hurt so they didn’t make it the first year. And then “washed Wade” got the Heat to the same place, while playing better that Pippen got without Jordan when Heat lost in 7 to Raptors.@WadexFlash @MiamiHEAT @JimmyButler @raf_tyler And we still got dipo coming, scary hoursAs a Miami Heat hater I will say I’m officially proud of Bam man 😂💯all I wanted him to do is keep getting 11+ rebounds consistently https://t.co/aUHWbgWx2nGood morning  to only Miami Heat fans ❤️Ray - Miami

I’ve heard multiple podcasts talk about the heat and my only thought is that they don’t have the best player in any series against Philly/Bucks/NetsThe Heat were built to stop Scary-Hours Nets...Bam, Jimmy, PJ - 3 superstar-stoppers to stop 3 superstars. And they won't even need to do that now.
Brooklyn, Milwaukee, Chicago and Philly each have a better player than anyone Miami has - but no one is a tougher out than the Heat.I’ve had an Amazing time tonight at #msg where the #knicks took on the #heat and HEAT WINS!!!

10 TOV - excellent
28 PF - atrocious
30 PFD - This won Miami the game tonightMissed those "Let's go #Heat" chants for Miami road games. Heard them tonight in NY as #Heat win 1st game after All Star break. Gotta 🥞 these wins! #HEATCultureJust saw Miami heat va NY nicks and it’s disappointing. Even though nicks had lost, they should have kept playing till the end - not this ‘hold the ball mopping’ crap.

I guess basketball has changed since I last saw it. #drink #beer #wow #NeverGiveUpLove it, this will only harm the heat. Imo Miami currently has a perfect rotation everyone knows their spot and fit in great. 

Oladipo imo will throw that off considerably https://t.co/dP9rZHt4k4Miami Heat win!#MIAvsNYK

Just can’t make more than $10,264,000 in Year 1 or Miami won’t be able to match as a restricted free agent.

@MiamiHEAT | #HEATCulture https://t.co/8MwvbQ0UsX@jedeyeee @_ThePrinciple28 @KingJames @dallasmavs @NBA When the game mattered, he let him score the go-ahead points over and over. I’m a heat fan I'm from Miami and live in Miami. We all saw prime LeBron choke. You must've never have gotten to see prime Jordan, cause if you did, you'd never post your nonsense.@MiamiHEAT HERRO PISSED OFFI agree with Doris Burke that Lamelo shouldn't have made the All-Star over Herro #MiamiHeatPlease send the “franchise killer” back to Miami Heat then. I’d love to get another chip. 😊 https://t.co/DLv2t2RDen@MiamiHEAT Tyler is such a stud. With this great team, the Heat are winning the finals this year. I CALLED IT!!!After such a slow start by the Miami Heat in that 1Q, they are only down 2 points after one quarter.

@MiamiHEAT @nyknicks 

#LEGENDoftheMiamiHEAT #NBA75Knicks started this game on a 10-0 run and Miami looked rusty as hell and I still never once felt like the Heat were in any danger lol.@SwaggyHeat @ChefTrillie_ @MiamiHEAT It has everything to do with it truly. We may be a good team but not a team that can afford to not score in the first quarter in the playoffs. The Knicks are a bad team. This is becoming more common then you’d like to see from a 1 seedEnd of first quarter: Knicks 32, Heat 30. After New York started the game with a 10-0 run, Miami narrowed the gap with the help of nine points from Kyle Lowry and eight points off the bench from Tyler Herro.@TrolledByJimmy @MiamiHEAT Thibodeau paid the refs tbf as jimmy said that “thibs would always tell us to hate Miami”Not a great 1st quarter miami heat but Herro been cooking#MIAvsNYK
