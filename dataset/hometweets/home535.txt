#bettingtips #bettingtwitterWhat happen with KPJ??? The @cavs have finally made me forget about him and that whole situation.

Most importantly: Go to Mobley MORE. He is unstoppable!@mattrph23 @ClvForVendetta @AlanAla73691898 @cavs Do you know how many people die each year?  So you’re a covid 0 guy eh?

How many of them are in good health and under 50?@mattrph23 @ClvForVendetta @AlanAla73691898 @cavs It’s only unmanageable Bc of policies.

Come tell the people in my hospital that they have the flu@TheRealDuane @ClvForVendetta @AlanAla73691898 @cavs We’re trying to get people out of hospitals. Because its unmanageable.

Yall need to go to him more. Id like to see you (darius) and Evan be the most agressive players on offense with our injuries. You guys are more than capable. Go out and take it.@cavs @dariusgarland22 We need our own bunny with a walker.@AFC_Owen_ @NBA Cleveland Cavaliers. Young, very exciting team.

Last year we were 13th seeded in the East at 22-50. So far this season, we are at 20-16. We do have players out for the season rn though, those being our starting SG Collin Sexton and backup PG Ricky Rubio.
