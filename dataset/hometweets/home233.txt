Bucks won NBA title, and MU keeps winning?!?!? 🙃@LandonGibson @RealTalk900 Conference Finals... So Wilt dominated someone who scored 34 points on his head every night because he held him to the same FG% that Wilt had? You're an idiot. The 1971-72 Lakers were the BETTER TEAM than the 1971-72 Milwaukee Bucks. Wilt averaged 10pts a game. Nice Try...The road goes on forever, and the party never ends!
