But I could see the Warriors do well on him. Maybe not fully stop him, but at least have him force tough shots and lower his efficiency.#TheShow rolls on now on the #ScoreWI with @LeoKiperJr &amp; @EricBalkman catching up with @lohausfan from @brewhoop ahead of tonight's @DetroitPistons &amp; @Bucks game on #BuckItUp: https://t.co/y1mL3q6zje https://t.co/4SMqTRtCG4@NBlakiston @Roger_fan123 @MaxRigman @Jumpshot8 @NBA @Suns @warriors @Bulls @nets @Bucks I wouldn't necessarily say only way, but yes that's one way.

Let’s call a spade a spade man- warriors are the best team in the west.@thatboy_17 @Col_Macpherson @AZSportsNut11 @SLAMonline @Bucks Defender hadn’t established any position. If anything that’s blocking, but imo just a good no call.@OBrianHargrave @Jumpshot8 @NBA @Suns @warriors @Bulls @nets @Bucks Not for long and only by ONE game.  And their point differential is only 4th in the conference.  That's a better measure than who's ahead by one game.@Bucks @Khris22m Does the Milwaukee Bucks say Hi back or give a follow?@AZSportsNut11 @Col_Macpherson @SLAMonline @Bucks Defender wasn’t even set in a legal guarding position. That can be a block-and-1 if you wanna call ticky-tack contact…or the refs can let them play like they did.@Bucks @Khris22m lmfaooo@hitmire @Bucks I knew who you meant.I just tried tried to match your funny😆You know what to do.

I mean that has to be an offensive foul initiating contact that way?@Meme_SZN_ @SLAMonline @Bucks How am I lying 😹 Giannis lowers his shoulder into Hernangomez’s body 😹😹😹😹😹I wouldn’t mind making a trip to Milwaukee every year if the Panthers were invited.
