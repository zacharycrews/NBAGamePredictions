Atlanta Hawks were great, but Miami Heat were insanely good this season. Wizards were good offensively, but struggled on defense. Clippers actually had good defense, but no Off. https://t.co/w2FWdsZbU8@UriahAdam @HawksPR @ATLHawks One is on a two way contract, meaning they’re a g league player that can get called to the NBA, and the other is on an NBA contract that was down graded to a g league rosterTop #NBA play today: Atlanta Hawks -7.0 (6.8 value)

You have no idea lol@GooseVallejo @JacobWhite0626 @NBA @ATLHawks You like to change the subject because I brought up that the hawks owned the sixers 💀@GooseVallejo @JacobWhite0626 @NBA @ATLHawks You started talking about the playoffs@GooseVallejo @JacobWhite0626 @NBA @ATLHawks And I’ve watched all Philly sports be irrelevant for years and years 💀@robbie_deason @JacobWhite0626 @NBA @ATLHawks And since we like bringing up shit from past seasons. I saw your falcons blow a 28-3 lead in the Súper bowl. Go cry@GooseVallejo @JacobWhite0626 @NBA @ATLHawks That’s not what we’re talking about thought is it?@robbie_deason @JacobWhite0626 @NBA @ATLHawks Also saw us cook you twice this current season.@GooseVallejo @JacobWhite0626 @NBA @ATLHawks You also watched the sixers lose 4-3 and choke a 20+ point lead 💀💀💀@JacobWhite0626 @robbie_deason @NBA @ATLHawks Yeah, I watched y’all lose the series 4-2@ATLHawks Hawks scored 9 points in 4th quarter@djbowmanracing @camhapp @sixers @ATLHawks Reddish 🐐People should never get their hopes up about teams from Georgia. The Atlanta hawks were an exception last year, and they didn’t even win it all. Mickey Mouse state@camhapp @sixers @ATLHawks And Philly with Simmons checked out.@djbowmanracing @sixers @ATLHawks And they only beat the Knicks in the playoffs, that's not hard@camhapp @sixers @ATLHawks Had to keep him cos his ceiling is high but he gets in foul trouble and can’t stay involved in game when he’s in foul trouble. I love him and he’s still young they a young team just probably overachieved last season@djbowmanracing @sixers @ATLHawks 100% guess that's why they didn't offer him a big contract extensionGeorgia Sports:
Braves: World Series Champs
Atlanta Falcons: SB 51 is still haunting you
Atlanta Hawks: Meh 
Atlanta United FC: Does ATL really care about soccer
Georgia Bulldogs: Blowing up in big games@camhapp @sixers @ATLHawks Agree JC to inconsistent IMO to reliant on Trae in a couple of years when Hunter and Reddish are more experienced they be serious team.@djbowmanracing @sixers @ATLHawks Had to win yesterday, that was a weak Philly side with Embiid half fit and little else@GooseVallejo @robbie_deason @NBA @ATLHawks Did you not watch hawks last playoff run??@ATLHawks @emoryhealthcare Let Collins dominate. He will be the only all star on the court if Trae doesn’t play.@camhapp @sixers @ATLHawks At full strength they are a legit 3-5 seed but they don’t have the depth to carry injuries IMO@Michael11571673 @terrence711 @ATLHawks @emoryhealthcare so its 2 G-league teams@ATLHawks @emoryhealthcare If trae and huerter don't play we gotta play shariffe and jalen🏀 #NBA #NBAtwitter
