Denver Nuggets - Minnesota Timberwolves

Nikola Jokic O12.5 Rebounds @ 1.75 ($100)

Jokic averaging 14.3 rebounds in December, and Minnesota is the #1 worst rebounding team in the league. I also like his match-up w/ Towns.

The Denver Nuggets.@JenniferSey If I went to a Denver Nuggets game, I would wear a mask so that nobody would know that I was there@TheAthletic @TheAthleticNBA @KDTrey5 @sam_amick @JoshuaBRobbins To everyone who's mad that Jokic isn't on this list:

You DO realize he plays for the Denver Nuggets, and  NONE of these former players *actually watch* the Denver Nuggets? Very simple explanation lol@Nuggets_TR denver nuggets tr de@bomani_jones The famously healthy and full strength Denver Nuggets@JoelRushNBA If we are talking about literally which player is most valuable to their team.

The hobbled Denver Nuggets without Jokic are useless, compared to the Bucks, Lakers or Warriors without their stars.

The 8-man Nets rotation gives them a run for their money but still.Easily one of the most fun quarters of this Denver #Nuggets season. https://t.co/a9GPdC332SGAME DAY for the Wolves!!

Way to go Matthew! https://t.co/XHlP4UVNJkAs Captain Doom and Gloom, I took possibly the greatest day in Denver Nuggets history and reimagined it with a twist:

What happens to the Denver Nuggets franchise if Jusuf Nurkiƒá, not Nikola Jokiƒá, is the center the Nuggets choose to lead their rebuild? https://t.co/sq2smamwqYFive years after the Denver Nuggets fateful anniversary of December 15th committing to Nikola Jokiƒá for good, @NBABlackburn asks a dark question:

What happens to the Nuggets franchise if Denver chose Jusuf Nurkiƒá over Nikola Jokiƒá?

Carmelo Anthony, after he won his ESPY in 2003, had an unprecedented person on his Thank You list.

"I also want to thank myself," said Anthony, who was picked 3rd overall in the NBA Draft by the Denver Nuggets. "I put in a lot of hard work day in and day out."
