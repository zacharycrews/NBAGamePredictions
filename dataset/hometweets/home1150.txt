💭 If we lose, we lose. We already know the tank vibes🤫, but above all else may @franzboogie  continue to state his claim for ROY 
#MagicTogetherTonight is the only realistic chance the Orlando Magic have to secure the worst record in the NBA.

If the Rockets lose as I would imagine, it will go down to a coin flip (assuming Orlando doesn’t win any more games).

The tank efforts from both teams will be damn near disgusting https://t.co/qwWCxdUwSJHey @OrlandoMagic perhaps have consistent security standards and personnel that aren’t rude and abrasive,meanwhile thanks for the reminder why we cancelled our season tickets! #magicisgoneTonight's starting lineup for the Orlando Magic: Anthony, Hampton, Franz Wagner, Okeke, Bamba
