Time for a bit of NBA #OrlandoMagic https://t.co/QY3GDDYLFl@MikeyBailey86 @OrlandoMagic @devin_cannady3 Said it before but I love the setup, mate!Maybe it's just me, but, I THINK, Orlando #Magic play their best game of #Nba year TONIGHT, shut Siakam DOwn. La Bambo! Think Cole really gon go, distribute + his drives, he's going to hit a couple deep, too, efficiently.
Markelle's going to add minutes, SHINE.

#MagicTogether #MoBamba #GoMagic #OrlandoMagic https://t.co/62OLp3MNby@MarshaBlackburn This woke stuff is going to bring down the ‚ÄòMagic‚Äô Kingdom. The bigger they are, the harder they fall. That‚Äôs some prime real estate there in Orlando!@OmahaSpeak Knott's Berry Farm, SeaWorld Orlando, or Kennywood is most definitely a better deal, in my opinion. What's the point of going to Disney World when all the magic and creative aspects/flourishes that made the park special to being with are completely stripped away for the dollar?@RP3toughscene @weekendtweeter @fadingpayload @Dom_2k He left the Magic, didn‚Äôt win there. T-Mac is the Orlando GOAT. Grant Hill even left the Pistons to go to the Magic and it was the best thing to ever happen to the Pistons lol@MathLarssonlol @MartellEverett @OrlandoMagic @CCDistillery @MarkelleF he doesn‚Äôt shoot free throws like thatCongratulations to GKTW wish child Masai for saving the Orlando Magic‚Äôs lovable mascot, Stuff the Magic Dragon, from The Joker during today‚Äôs Batkid For A Day presented by The Axel Foundation.
