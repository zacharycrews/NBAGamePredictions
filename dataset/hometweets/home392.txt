@Mark25Price @_bigjayy_ https://t.co/tWWkaQhJtQ https://t.co/GVABI802ul@cavs don't need to trade for a star that will hog up the usage. They need a perimeter shooter that can score when given the ball. That is it. I would still even be fine with Okoro starting and adding that shooter to the 2nd unit.It is speculation on my part but I think that the NBA knows that they went too far in rigging the recent Phoenix Suns vs. Cleveland Cavaliers game so that the Suns would win.

Now, the Cavs are being shown extra love to cover up what happened in that game.

It was a tweet that blew up because most people misinterpreted it. My focus as a Browns fan right now is burying the stupid Ravens.@brownsfan593 @AbelFCano @cavs It‚Äôs not a dumb idea. I‚Äôve interacted with several fans on Twitter in the last 48 hours who have flagplantitis. They exist, and in the thousands. They are a very small, yet very loud minority.

It‚Äôs a shame that if I still lived in DC I could, but now that I live in CLE I can‚Äôt.@CardenBrent @cavs @dariusgarland22 Absolutely agree!I've seen some folks asking if @cavs play is sustainable. I would direct those folks to how the cavs play as the answer; it's not a ball dominant-powered offense. Sure, Garland is gonna have the rock a ton, but it's not only high PNR over and over again orWhat a delightful team and a good win. The schedule eases up here for a couple weeks for @cavs not gonna lose many games where your starters shoot 70%@Spas_tik_ @MarkCor28 @EdGreenberger @cavs I‚Äôm saving this so I can come back and gloat ‚Äòcause he certainly will!!!!It's almost as if the @cavs said if we have a prototypical big that will do the defensive dirty work inside it will allow Love to do the rare set of things Love does insanely well. Like swallow up rebounds and hit outlet bounce passes 3/4 court https://t.co/NMQCIm7VHELMAO why should @cavs buy out Love for nothing again? 

As an aside, this is the defense the Miami Heat were playing for four seasons with Wade, LBJ, Bosh. You wonder why San Antonio turned them inside out in 2014? https://t.co/o8BKpX5mFg@jaypflug @DPini22 @cavs Just losers making fun of women (probably because they can‚Äôt get one), negative Browns fans, and people calling the Cavs ‚Äúfun‚Äù.
