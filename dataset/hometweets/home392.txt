No more value, you took all the money already from every book! #GamblingTwitter@SammySweet @RobOstrom @EdGreenberger @cavs So I searched your old tweets for the word "Baker."

That tracks. 🖕 https://t.co/hh5Yi6vlq8@Poo76460295 @Xzelasmr @cavs He's better than Alonzo gee. I would say right now he's more an Iman Shumpurt from his first year with the cavs. Can play defense and occasionally make some shots.

I'll ask again but I'll type slower this time since you can't read fast:

1. Where am I "bitching" or "crying" in this thread?

2. Why are you holding it against Baker that certain fans are making "excuses" for his play?@cavs Alley oop game crazy@aaronkollar @cavs @Boards2Buckets I did praise them last @Boards2Buckets  steam 😁 https://t.co/BgUAAKpJDm@brownsfan593 @cavs Excellent response.

https://t.co/azn1hPWXcn@BallySportsCLE @_bigjayy_ @cavs @DreKnott Such a great dude for this city. Hope we can keep him for his career and hang a jersey in the rafters one day. Thinking he could be that good!@Xzelasmr @cavs @isaacokoro303 YOU KNOW BALL@BuckeyeRP @hylander91 @cavs Well, first off, I’ve interacted with several fans who have admitted it. (Most won’t, by the way.) Second, being “disappointed” by his performance this year doesn’t explain the vitriol of some fans. At all.12/11 NBA Picks

I don't think there are any wholly unbiased and impartial Browns fans out there who believe Baker is a "bad" QB. He's not and that's a fact, not an opinion. If there are any unbiased fans out there who believe this then they don't understand the game.@statmuse @cavs Bruh on 10 fgas per game too???? That's actually nuts.Day 1 of tweeting @BallySportsCLE and @cavs until they figure out their user experience or the Cavs leave the Bally sports network.Can somebody talk about it!! @cavs @KendrickPerkins https://t.co/1VCM9xX9b8@Rob_Shenanigans @Coach_DLOVE @EdGreenberger @cavs “You’re” too busy worrying about people spelling correctly on a social media app. Probably should be focusing on that sub-mediocre QB play in a year that I’ll guess you had us going…12-5? 13-4? Stop defending 🗑. https://t.co/ZZiPFEDxLa@hakaitan @NBA @cavs It is shown all over the country but most people don't even get that channel.

Why is it that the Baker Haters can never put together a cogent argument to rationalize their hate?

After what happened to the 2017-18 Cleveland Cavaliers?I really love this young, funky Cleveland Cavaliers squad but looking at today’s game objectively:

No one in Sacramento should consider this a “get right” game.

@cavs are in my blood 
@Mark25Price @_bigjayy_ https://t.co/tWWkaQhJtQ https://t.co/GVABI802ul@cavs don't need to trade for a star that will hog up the usage. They need a perimeter shooter that can score when given the ball. That is it. I would still even be fine with Okoro starting and adding that shooter to the 2nd unit.It is speculation on my part but I think that the NBA knows that they went too far in rigging the recent Phoenix Suns vs. Cleveland Cavaliers game so that the Suns would win.

Now, the Cavs are being shown extra love to cover up what happened in that game.

My focus as a Browns fan right now is burying the stupid Ravens.@brownsfan593 @AbelFCano @cavs It’s not a dumb idea. I’ve interacted with several fans on Twitter in the last 48 hours who have flagplantitis. They exist, and in the thousands. They are a very small, yet very loud minority.

It’s a shame that if I still lived in DC I could, but now that I live in CLE I can’t.@CardenBrent @cavs @dariusgarland22 Absolutely agree!I've seen some folks asking if @cavs play is sustainable. I would direct those folks to how the cavs play as the answer; it's not a ball dominant-powered offense. Sure, Garland is gonna have the rock a ton, but it's not only high PNR over and over again orWhat a delightful team and a good win. The schedule eases up here for a couple weeks for @cavs not gonna lose many games where your starters shoot 70%@Spas_tik_ @MarkCor28 @EdGreenberger @cavs I’m saving this so I can come back and gloat ‘cause he certainly will!!!!It's almost as if the @cavs said if we have a prototypical big that will do the defensive dirty work inside it will allow Love to do the rare set of things Love does insanely well. Like swallow up rebounds and hit outlet bounce passes 3/4 court https://t.co/NMQCIm7VHELMAO why should @cavs buy out Love for nothing again? 

As an aside, this is the defense the Miami Heat were playing for four seasons with Wade, LBJ, Bosh. You wonder why San Antonio turned them inside out in 2014? https://t.co/o8BKpX5mFg@jaypflug @DPini22 @cavs Just losers making fun of women (probably because they can’t get one), negative Browns fans, and people calling the Cavs “fun”.  That is Twitter right now.  HahaStarting to think the Cavs have a legitimate chance to make it to/win the ECF #Cavs #LetEmKnow @cavsWe could do a thread of at least a dozen of these this season in semi transition where Allen slips a stagger look and Garland throws it up.

FG% in the case of players who take a noticeable amount of 3s, is not fine.@cavs @isaacokoro303 I guess the trade talks we took too seriously.  Carry on. Maybe he can average now 20 pts a game and get better shooting 3s.I love this @cavs team@dat_dude_dys @SFOURDEE @JamesHa27374257 @stephenasmith Nobody said KD is trash but basketball is game of chess.

CAVS ARE GOOD@duds14 @cavs Once they kept playing well beyond 20 games I decided to jump on the bandwagon 😉 https://t.co/eZBSt9apbF@cavs You never cease to amaze me with these@NBA @cavs Jarrett goat@Huffman_12 @cavs 40 minutes of garbage time@cavs keep it rollin!!!The Cleveland @cavs are the only team in the @NBA that’s undefeated against teams under .500. #Cavs #NBA75 #hopeididntjustjinxitMinnesota Timberwolves 106 (Karl Anthony Towns 21 pts, Leandro Bolmaro 2 pts) Cleveland Cavaliers 123 (Jarrett Allen 21 pts, 10 rebs), Charlotte Hornets 124 (James Bouknight 24 pts) Sacramento Kings 123 (De'Aaron Fox 31 pts).@Cavs stretch their streak of victories by blowout to six. Haven’t been tested in a W since Nov. 13 vs. Boston (91-89). #LetEmKnow.@NBATV when y'all gonna give the @cavs some love? 

P.S. I'm gonna bother y'all until you respond.Is it me or are the @cavs the third best team in the eastern conference with room to grow?! https://t.co/OHdxjepICX@cavs Another practice in the books 😎@cavs #LetEmKnow we’re back https://t.co/CTkgUsrh0r@EdGreenberger @cavs As an OSU alum/fan, I forgave Baker for that. He is on the Browns. If you can’t separate your fandoms, might want to rethink things.@cavs Damn I spelled once wrong 😔@cavs W admin@EdGreenberger @cavs I love the Buckeyes more than anything but if Baker wins a super bowl for Cleveland I’ll sneak into the shoe and plant the oklahoma flag if he wants.Man I’m really excited to be a @cavs fan this year. We’ll worth the waitThe @cavs improved to 9-5 on the road after tonight's 123-106 win in Minnesota. 

Cleveland is also now 7-2 on the road since Nov. 1.THE CLEVELAND CAVALIERS1st words out of @_bigjayy_  mouth w/@DreKnott were “it was a team effort.”
@DreKnott One of the best. He brings out the personalities of the @cavs players. WHICH a great interviewer does.

Mobley of course a lock for under 16 points. One of the worst ROTY candidates to EVER play in the NBA.@wasted_voter @cavs But I know Isaac is going to go 1-7 for four points tomorrow.

I just want someone that can give the rest of these guys space on the offensive end when hes on the floor. Its simple.Simply put, if you are not a lock to win the east or the west, my Cleveland Cavaliers will blow your doors off and be up by 30 at some point on your hometown teams floor. *insert RJ clip*@cavs THT: 11PTS 3 REB 2 AST 1 STL 🔥🔥

They were saying we aren’t a real team, just like coffin flop wasn’t a real show@ed_the_all_wise @cavs It's his biggest weakness as a coach. If Sexton was healthy Cedi would be out of the rotation. That's how absurd this is.My brother is taking me to a @cavs game for my bday I’m so pumped man I haven’t been to a game in yeeears. Maybe they could hook me up with some type of birthday gift ehh??

#LetEmKnow #Cavs https://t.co/vwMJetBZrV@dmansworld474 @cavs Think lebron wants to come back……..@EV4NMOBLEY @cavs @BallySportsCLE Waive this ratioThe @cavs' 21-point halftime lead is due in large part to Isaac Okoro holding Anthony Edwards, the Timberwolves' second-leading scorer, to 4-of-12 shooting from the field overall and 1-of-5 from beyond the arc.

#LetEmKnow | @DreKnott https://t.co/c4CTFBxyP8The Cleveland Cavaliers have a better record than the Los Angeles Lakers. 🤔Collin Sexton is still a huge part of this Cleveland Cavaliers franchise! He will be back, &amp; he will be better from this setback! 

#LetEmKnow@cwmwrites Come on wit it @cwmwrites This foolishness has got to stop.. I’ve seen exactly 2 @cavs games and 3 @CleGuardians games since October of 2020… EXTREMELY UNEXCEPTIONABLE!!
