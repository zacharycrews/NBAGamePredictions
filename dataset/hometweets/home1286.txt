@RevsRundown @TalkinJake @Suns @Dbacks It would be nice for there to be another competitive team in the division, but I just don’t see it happening. Nice start for the Dbacks, and they won a series against the Dodgers, but the Dodgers lineup hasn’t even woken up yet. I don’t see the Dbacks contending come July.@peakoko @Jari2Fly @Suns theyre always in here. it’s better to ignore them because they do bite.It’s time!

The only way the @Suns winning a championship can, in the moment of victory, really top @Luisgonzo20 winning the World Series in 2001 is with @DevinBook hitting a game 7 buzzer-beating, game-winning 3.

* Over 207.5 Sixers/Heat (15-70 three’s G1)

* Phoenix -6 (4Q run after Suns quit playing should give Mavs false sense of security)

U tried acting like the Lakers didn't have much &amp; weren't that good before they got Magic. U were wrong. With or w/o Magic they either won it all or lost to a Finals team from '77-'88. In '81 they lost in the 1st rd w/Magic...How far do you think the @Suns will advance this season?

They tried in game one.  Another huge FT disparity towards the opponent.@BleedingOrnge @Jumpshot8 @Suns @FlexFromJersey Know my history? Ok clown. 🤣 A bit ironic coming from you. 😂

Soon as Nash got checked players go at each other and have to be separated on court. THAT is an altercation. Nothing remotely like that happened on this Payton Jr. play.

Those 3 playoff defeats u bring up were ALL THREE to teams that made it to the Finals that year (with 2 of the 3 winning it all &amp; the 3rd coming 6 pts in game 7 from winning it).

And who’s to say without Magic that some of these cats (sans Kareem) would’ve been HOFers??A couple thoughts after last night’s @Suns game☀️: 

1. We have beat Dallas 10 games in a row! (there last win was in 2019) 
2.Jae crowders been to the last 2 Finals in a row! (soon to be 3? I smell a Suns vs Bucks rematch) 
3. Mikal Bridges won 2 chips at Nova!?  #ProvenWinner@CamaroAdict1985 @lasakespear @Prince15081967 @NBA @CP3 @Suns I think we’re getting at the same thing. . My comment was toward @lasakespear ‘s comment he joined a team of ballers.  My point was that “team of ballers” got bounced the years prior and like you just said, when Magic was hurt the next year, they were bounced againThree years ago: Phoenix Suns quickly changed course for the better after hiring Monty Williams https://t.co/4AY3pP0bl8The Phoenix Suns and Miami Heat are top seeds in the NBA playoffs and at the moment they look like it, coming off impressive performances. https://t.co/EkBmGaX7Ik@MattBallestero4 @lasakespear @Prince15081967 @NBA @CP3 @Suns Yet Magics 2nd season he played just 37 games yet their record only fell from 60 wins to 54 and got beat in the 1st rd. The Lakers had 2-4 HOFers around Magic from the moment he joined the Lakers to the moment he first  retired in '91/'92. My fav all tome great but it's the facts@IAmMattBetz gotta buoy the ratings before they play the "small market" Phoenix Suns.@MattBallestero4 @lasakespear @Prince15081967 @NBA @CP3 @Suns Lol kid they already had HOFers in Kareem &amp; Wilkes who were 32 &amp; 26. Plus along w/Magic they added HOFer Spencer Haywood &amp; basically added Cooper (played just 3 games the season before as a rook) &amp; Norm Nixon was developing at 24/25 just a few seasons from making All Star.🤦🏼‍♂️🤣.Jalen Brunson says Dallas ‘eased into’ Game 1 vs. Phoenix, resulting in the Suns’ tone-setting 1st quarter run...

But he and the Mavs got off to a similar start vs. Utah, and both were able to bounce back. 🤔
