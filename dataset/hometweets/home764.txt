Look to see how the Suns handle Kyrie and (potentially) Harden. Those two will be putting up the most shots attempted. If the Suns can stop them, then that would be a huge victory for this Phoenix team. 

#ValleyProud #KyrieIrving #CourtSideHeatNets head coach Steve Nash is back where it all began for him in 1996. Here's a look back at his 40+ point games with the Phoenix Suns.

Lebron interrupted and sabotaged us with Westbrook. https://t.co/oXjtitDv4JAs a tribute to his late grandfather, @CP3 scored 61 points in one game to honor every year of his grandpa's life. He was fouled at the end of the game and purposely airballed the last foul shot to keep his points at 61. #REPuThrowback #Suns #NBA #PhoenixSuns #REPu https://t.co/EHi7BizMbKGet a preview of the Brooklyn Nets vs. Phoenix Suns basketball game. https://t.co/63zEo1bmTj

Poor perimeter defense &amp; inability to make WIDE OPEN 3-POINTERS.  That's your 2 Priorities for any MAJOR TRADE. Point guard is not a major weakness as long as you got Lebron = 2019-20 point guard.It's @brooklynnets vs. @suns in Phoenix tonight — who do you got?! Let us know in the replies!

In honor of tonight's game we're throwing it back to high school with @KyrieIrving + @CP3.

- If CVS isn't in Chicago, I don't the Sky repeating.
- Phoenix is somehow about to do some interesting math + become the league frontrunner.
- A healthy Elena Delle Donne puts Mystics in the mix.

But with what I have seen this season, I feel they could better their 51-21 record from last season and make a real push in the postseason. 49 games played and they have a 40-9 record. This team is hot@TodayInSports3 Old school Phoenix Suns logo@money_talks65 @TheHoopCentral Lockdown defenders still get scored on occasionally. 😂😂😂  They do a better job than the majority NBA defenders.

Brooklyn has won eight of the past 10 games against the Suns in Phoenix, and have the second-best road record in the league (17-7), trailing the Suns. 

James Harden (right hand strain) remains questionable.@Franky_SoSmooth @BeccaMVP2 The Phoenix Suns clogged the paint with 4 defenders and challenged the Lakers to make WIDE OPEN 3-POINTERS. 😭😭😭 Westbrook can’t make those 3-pointers either = 30.5% for 3-pointers career stat.
