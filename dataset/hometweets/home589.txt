On this page we talk @HoustonRockets. If you have any input add it. Right now were #15 in western conference. 11 wins 28 losses. https://t.co/lu5FI9yYlh@Mattygfor3 @john_keeffer I agree. I hate whenever anyone brings this up. It literally doesn’t matter. The Jazz have the same chance of winning a ring as the 2022 Houston Rockets without either one of them. They’re both on max contracts. It literally doesn’t matter one bit who is better. Just win.@Sportsnet @HoustonRockets Fruit loops!?! @ryan12456985Hey @HoustonRockets @ToyotaCenter 

See you tomorrow! https://t.co/MqLnrI5klH@HoustonRockets sign him. https://t.co/AUj3O5MfUY@HoustonRockets @ToyotaCenter Taking a page from @ProgressiveFans and Happy Dog Cleveland, huh?@GSWarriorsWorld I can tell you only watch stats because I watch houston that entire year and during that stretch harden was playing some of his worse basketball as a rocket still better than most because he can get to the line but it was not good@roo_44 @CrankyCyborg @HoustonRockets @ToyotaCenter Agreed. And I'm OK with that. 😁The Houston Rockets Luc Monte had a twitterbot with no followers.@dizzygotbanned1 @BiasedHouston Most of Harden's Career was carrying the Houston Rocket's on his back in the regular season and being too burned out to continue on in the playoffs. The man needed help and he got that with CP3. Kyrie literally had the best player to ever touch a basketball.@HoustonRockets @bull50 The 🐐of Houston announcers!@TodayInSports3 @HoustonRockets Do you eat this with a Latte because that the only thing that makes sense@SilipigniMario @CrankyCyborg @HoustonRockets @ToyotaCenter It looks like a Midwest state fair offering.@HoustonRockets @ToyotaCenter @Invigoratept this is you for sureHeat making the suns look like the Houston rockets 😱@rockets3413 @HoustonRockets Definitely.

We give up on players too fast2018 Houston Rockets🚀🚀 https://t.co/5luwLtgw9Q@HoustonRockets @ToyotaCenter I hope you named it 11-29 coz that shit looks horrible.@HoustonRockets @catwomyn31 Bill Worrell and Bob Costas was my childhood. Sitting in front of my TV every game watching. Cancelling plans with friends on weekends just to hear his voice call the games. I am going to miss this man!@TodayInSports3 @HoustonRockets It’s like a basket on Chopped.Friday was officially named “Bill Worrell Day” by the City of Houston, and the Rockets honored his legendary 40-year broadcasting career throughout that night’s game at Toyota Center.  https://t.co/7hZrggWx1K@TodayInSports3 @HoustonRockets Yummy!!!¡@HoustonRockets Bill i love how you announce a game very down to heart you will be miss@HoustonRockets I’m attending the Rox game against the Spurs this coming Wed in SA. Do y’all know if I have to show proof of vaccination or have a negative test result to attend? Can’t find a clear answer on their website?How about this trade…

#Celtics get: John Wall and Jae’Sean Tate

#Rockets get: Al Horford, Josh Richardson and Juancho Hernangomez 

Houston gets about $20 million in extra cap space next year. Boston gets a veteran leader and a potential long-term rotation guy in Tate.@TodayInSports3 @HoustonRockets WTF is this!@TodayInSports3 @HoustonRockets might be kinda good? the cost is what's gonna really make me cry@Dreday80m8 @HoustonRockets @ToyotaCenter My thoughts exactly 🤣 🤣The Houston Rockets Zhou Qi had a falling out with his uncle billy.@DimmadomeHat That's up there with "I be down in houston like kareem I'm a rocket"@Jipufix First, how are you blocked by the Houston Rockets???

Like it or not Scott foster committed a crime even nba players were talking about it, so yeah Houston was definitely better that series just not enough luck@HoustonRockets @ToyotaCenter 15 minutes later… https://t.co/1ZyBBmALsc@Sportsnet @HoustonRockets Would I try it????
How could you not?Houston Rockets hotheads Christian Wood and Kevin Porter Jr. may have added themselves to the trade block. Should Portland make a deal for one of them?

https://t.co/QbIEaGq4aI@TheAstrosLocker I’m still an Oilers fan. I never left my team. The Oilers didn’t leave you, the city of Houston ran Bud Adams out of town because he was an asshole. Somehow, as soon as he was gone, they spent a BILLION $ on new stadiums. I’m an Astros fan, a Rockets fan &amp; Dynamo.  Never #Texans.@Sportsnet @HoustonRockets Is this an SNL skit?@ColeyMick @HoustonRockets Deal y’all get John WallSteve Francis was selected second overall in the 1999 NBA draft and was named co-NBA Rookie of the Year. 

He was a three-time NBA All-Star while playing for the Houston Rockets.

He was known for his crossover dribble, driving ability, and flashy dunks. https://t.co/hU1fnCGuKr@rickygiotti @pdxGRAPHIN Once at Loyola the Lakers and Clippers were practicing and the Sixers were stuck in the parking lot waiting for one of them to finish so they could practice.

#HoustonRockets #CamReddish #atlantahawks #NBA #basketballThe Houston Rockets have lost 72.5% of their games this season.
