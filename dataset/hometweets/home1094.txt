Jan 4th there was no excuse, just a cold night from KD. Does that satisfy your question Clint?@notthefakeSVP I noticed after the @BrooklynNets losing to @memgrizz

WHAT A GAME! Grizzlies are 15-2 without Ja this year! 😳 https://t.co/cdv8pKydgXA few things about the @memgrizz Grizzlies…
1. Ja Morant 
2. They are a young rough &amp; tumble, energy team 
3. They live in the paint/mid ranges but they have sharp consistent 3 pt shooters
4. Have the size for both ends of the floor
5. Clearly well coached

You do that with Lebron when he scores and loses with 2 NBA top 75 players.

So KEVIN DURANT.

P.S : Just showing how pathetic lebron fans are when they do that.
