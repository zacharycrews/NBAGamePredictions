#dALLasIN #Crypto4All https://t.co/SmZkFzr4zFThe Dallas Mavericks (+105) will try to keep their season alive when they host the Phoenix Suns (-2) for game 6 tonight

🏀Phoenix is 10-4 ATS in their last 14 games vs Dallas
🏀Dallas is 10-1 SU in their last 11 home games
🏀The  under is 9-4 in the last 13 games in this matchup https://t.co/I8ZMzIatyI@Tx_Tender_Love_ @dallasmavs Enjoy my friend. Pray that you are doing well. Stay safe.
❤️❤️❤️This a tough call. I think the @Suns will win the series but after last night the way the Grizz staved off elimination, I think @dallasmavs will win as the home dog at +2 to force a game 7, which is on my Christmas list. #NBAPlayoffs https://t.co/crrszMbA9sI love people watching at Mavs games. The crowd I've met so far tonight is ready so let's go @dallasmavs #MFFL@Livvingnew I'm not surprised, considering some of the issues that the Dallas Mavericks organization has had regarding their toxic workplace culture, that would be brought to light again if they address this unfortunate occurrence.🏀 @robvenosports has his eye on a specific player to go over his 3-pointers made prop tonight in the Mavericks vs Suns Game 6 in Dallas. See which player it is as he provides a full run down of the game from a betting perspective!

I love it 😍🤣This season, the Dallas Mavericks were 44% better when Luka played than when he didn’t; the Phoenix Suns were 45% better when Booker played than when he didn’t.

Note: it’s harder to increase that winning percentage when you play for a better team.Yelling at Biden for inflation is a lot like yelling at the Dallas Cowboys because a Dallas Maverick missed a 3 pointer.

Please win @SpursOfficial @dallasmavs@HRenewedHope @THENEXTBlGTHlNG @dallasmavs @Chime Because the match up isn't good for him or Luka for the pick and roll. Bridges fights over every screen so Ayton can play drop coverage. The pick and roll game has been taken away from us because we can't set good strong offensive screen. 

Well played by Bridges and Crowder thoCan the @Suns wrap up the series on the road, or will the @dallasmavs force a Game 7? 👀

This whole series comes down to how much Dallas can get out of their role players, who perform much better at home.

Unders is a solid play here, but I'll be taking the points, confident Doncic can force a Game 7 in this series.

Robert Sarver went over then GM Ryan McDonough's head. Drafted Ayton from the U of A which Sarver is a Booster/Alum. So if you know this back story? It just makes sense this series WOULD BE chippy.@elonmusk might die?

Here’s the hilarious part. Luka is a clear better player than Book 

Mavericks are capped out, that talent excuse is bull especially against the suns 

It’s easier to drop in book than Luka &amp; that’s a Luka prob. https://t.co/tyPGfhkThzNBA Basketball Game Betting Picks Simulator: 5/12/2022 9:30 PM ET - Phoenix Suns vs. Dallas Mavericks - YOU CAN RUN THE GAME SIMULATION FOR FREE HERE: https://t.co/n1NWAyJKT0 #nba #gamblingtwitter #sportsbetting #freepicks #cappertek@chestersd4 Let's go Dallas mavericks#dALLasIN Soooo Travis Taurus Pernell Taylor aka @mo_shabazz7 from Hemingway SC, is not fit to be a father, coach or mentor of young people because he is physically, mentally, physically and emotionally abusive towards women.
