I definitely didn't, especially Andre Drummond yet he has been just as valuable as Curry has

I personally liked the trade before, I like it even more now #NetsWorld@BrooklynNets Most skilled PG ever!!Really fascinating to watch all of the NBA Games last night

Bulls with a must win against the Cavaliers and due to the Raptors beating the low seeded Pacers

It dropped the Cavaliers to the 7th seed which is huge for the Brooklyn Nets for obvious reasons

Kyrie Irving set to make home season debut for Brooklyn Nets Sunday night https://t.co/dx1Q37HY2t@AdamBrr @chrisbosh @BrooklynNets CB &amp; Micky were sick https://t.co/JqxAxRdrsm@madeby47 @IsaacMurisa @Chef_Itayi @BrooklynNets You are allowed to pretty much take as many steps as you want as long as you aren't illegally carrying or palming the ball. So Drummond can take those steps and then grab the ball with both hands to take his final two steps.I don't see how you can minimize this 4 game losing streak

The Heat were suppose to be locking up the #1 seed and ramping up for the playoffs

Instead they lost to 3 absolutely SHITTY teams and got embarrassed by the Brooklyn Nets@0x_eLCrypto @StonedApeCrew @BrooklynNets That’s lit asf fam!

Their playing with a different excitement. Kyrie is back, and  Playmaking is back!  A lot of "cookies" were taken in the first half!I need me😤 @BrooklynNets https://t.co/Z6shROUjCG@theScore @BrooklynNets He gotta make up for all those lost shots from this seasonFrom NetsPR

Biggest halftime leads for Nets on road this season:

30 points - 3/15 at Orlando

26 points - 3/8 at Charlotte

21 points - 3/10 at Philadelphia

#LEGENDoftheMiamiHEAT #NBA75I expect both Brooklyn and Miami to come out w/ a chip on their shoulders and play w/ a little fire. Kyrie starts playing at home for Brooklyn tomorrow vs CHA (3/27/2022), but I believe his play starts tonight vs a quality Miami Heat team #NBA @MiamiHEAT @BrooklynNetsToday is a money line day. We’re gonna go with @memgrizz money line and the @BrooklynNets money line.
