Phoenix is on a B2B with both Booker and Ayton questionable. Portland should have Lillard back but McCollum is out. I see this as a virtual tossup that should go under.

If the cost is low enough, I'd definitely go after Nance.

Let’s keep egging them on Eggers towards greatness!Despite losing 5 in a row and 8 of 9 to fall to 10th place in the West, @trailblazers (11-16) are still just 5 1/2 games out of 4th and 3 out of 8th. Trouble is, at some point you have to start winning some games. Portland is only 2 1/2 games ahead of No. 14 OKC (8-18).
