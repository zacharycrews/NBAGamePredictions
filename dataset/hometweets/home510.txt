Also Ja walked on the last play anywaysIt won't get much easier for them tonight in this tough spot.  Now they take on a Memphis Grizzlies team that just got back JA Morant and is about as healthy as any team in the NBA right now.  That has shown in their last two games with a 127-102 blowout road win at SacramentoWednesday's Free Pick: Memphis Grizzlies -5.5

This is a tough spot for the Los Angeles Lakers tonight.  They will be playing the 2nd of a back-to-back after a 132-123 shootout win in Houston last night. LeBron James played over 39 minutes and Russell Westbrook played 35 minutes.@gov_tom2024 @thhtthh1 @memgrizz @NBA I’m not saying he’s better but to act like he would he make zero impact on the game is just ignorantCodeCrew is joining Mentor Memphis Grizzlies and @MENTORnational in celebrating National Mentor Month and MLK Day of Service.

You never hear a Memphis fan making injury excuses when we lose.@sayhiarjun @ArshadDahlan123 @statmuse @DBane0625 @memgrizz @GrizzliesPR If you gotta say “its a joke” its a bad joke@NBA @memgrizz Makes me feel good know little guys can get it in when it countsGone are the days of debating whether @JaMorant is an @NBA All-Star. 

Now are the days of debating how many and which other @memgrizz players should also make the team! https://t.co/iurMZFR6Vk@TheNBACentral Desmond Bane @memgrizz@memgrizz @jarenjacksonjr Top rightBring Tyreke back @memgrizz @TyrekeEvans https://t.co/GRfN1BZqVN@memgrizz @jarenjacksonjr Totally traveledI am very much here for the @DBane0625 @JaMorant mutual appreciation society.  #TCU @memgrizz https://t.co/1yY6QeexcP@statmuse @DBane0625 @memgrizz @GrizzliesPR that last part is just you trynna fit in bruh lmao a lot of hoop fans know he been a bucket@Corkey910 @NBA @JaMorant @memgrizz Sounds like a team destined to still not win an NBA Title then.@memgrizz @JaMorant @DBane0625 I’m smiling but it’s cuz the burger I had was from Burger King and I just pooped it out with only a short period of sweat and tears.@memgrizz #1 is me watching these COVID case counts@FedExForum @memgrizz @Lakers @AdamRedrum is that you outside the gambling bar?@WinsNLosses_ @memgrizz @NBA Dillon Brooks, DeAnthony Melton, Ziaire Williams, &amp; more were outWe have all the delicious food and entertainment in our home!

it’s not easy to put up good numbers on decent efficiency when you’re the number 1 option on a team with terrible spacing@memgrizz @JaMorant @KingJames @Lakers Who can help me out and get me tickets so my 11 year old kid can see his two favorite players go head to head.  I would love to surprise him for his birthday and drive down from St Louis tomorrow.@Ugonnaaaa @volshater69 @Helcio_97 @thatboyluis2 @JaMorant In 76 years , the warriors were only able to come up with 6 championship out of 35 playoff appearances. The Memphis Grizzlies have yet to win a championship in their 25 years after 11 playoff appearances.@tthehut @rjsmith_01 @Kingdame79 @tswhsien754921 @statmuse @DBane0625 @memgrizz @GrizzliesPR What parts of his game are average? Enlighten me please…@brooksethomas Decade+ now. Not a new thing. 

Timberlake is part owner of the Memphis Grizzlies. Other examples in other sports.@Goodwarriorsfan @Jumpshot8 @DiJon_4DeLo @memgrizz Turns out it's difficult to win when you're missing your head coach and half your roster. Piss poor performance none the less@GrizzliesPR @memgrizz @Lakers Bruuh wtf is wrong with Sam Merrill ankle yo this ain’t right@crouton_asu @memgrizz She gotta start something with that!! I wanna pair lol!!@JaMorant is a straight-up, stonefaced killer in crunch time.  Dude hasa Jordan level of confidence and self-belief. The future is gonna be fun for the @memgrizz@memgrizz @NBA @RealStevenAdams He’s really turned it around for us what a beastMemphis grizzlies lot with Brandon Clarke and ja morant slabs @sports_sell https://t.co/wvzuAQQufU@memgrizz @NBA Deandre Ayton was out@xClubster @memgrizz @NBA @RealStevenAdams Disagree, only 28 still got longevity in the league 🤷🏽‍♀️@adam_bushman @statmuse @DBane0625 @memgrizz @GrizzliesPR Still care…. Can’t believe they drafted Dok over him….@xClubster @memgrizz @NBA @RealStevenAdams Disagree, 19 and 12 seems pretty good to me 🤣@_spree4three @JamesWEdmundson @greensboroswarm @Luh_Sneed @memgrizz I dont believe that. The hornets need shooters and Gelo is a pure shooter and plays with hustle. I'd say Gelo fits the Hornets team better than Bouk.@xClubster @memgrizz @NBA @RealStevenAdams What you talking about girl?@xClubster @memgrizz @NBA @RealStevenAdams Adams will have a field day against Robert Williams 😉@xClubster @memgrizz @NBA @RealStevenAdams JV couldn’t make this much impact if he was still here.@memgrizz Top left because I just heard about John Madden and I don't want to believe it.@memgrizz @NBA And folks want to make light of how good this Grizzlies team is. They're going to fool around and find out. Don't sleep on the Grizzlies.@xClubster @memgrizz @NBA @RealStevenAdams He’s not a top 15 centre skill wise, value wise he’s top 10. Casual.@SeattleMariNERD @memgrizz Best wishes to you two &lt;3#youtube Ja Morant on SINKING game-winner to give Memphis Grizzlies the WIN over Phoenix Suns https://t.co/1mEvkgFmM3Going to his First @NBA  game tomorrow to see @memgrizz  vs @Lakers !!!
