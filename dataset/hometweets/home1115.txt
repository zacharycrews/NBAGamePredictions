all.He was saying aces ability looked like the sun.Thus he said the sun vs darkness.
Saying that’s foreshadowing is a huge stretch because nothing here implies any connection to luffy other then he word sunEvery year I cool down during the winter and heat up when the sun comes back out.

It shouldn't be for best stats. Voters fell for Russ' stat padding in 2016 when he was 6th seed but won't again. If your team is bad enough you can get all the shots, rebounds and assists.@tinastoklosa @sixers @Suns Let’s go!@Jumpshot8 @Suns Thank yourself. You pushed the narrative that the suns could win with or without booker. Now you’re wondering why everyone is saying he’s not mvp3/27/19 – Devin Booker became the youngest player in #NBA history w/back-to-back 50p games (22-148 - 59p at Utah 2 days earlier) when he finished w/50p (w/10r/4a), the 8th 50+ game in franchise-history.

Where my Suns fans at?! 🤧

This took awhile to put together &amp; a lot of work to get these cards put together.. But, I’m happy to introduce to you, your Phoenix Suns all-time MyTeam squad 😍

Who needs to be added to the Suns all time lineup next? https://t.co/TRjPHG2aDB@Cartierintern @DevinBook @Suns I imagine many suns fans are@BigLeagz Phoenix @Suns , Boston @RedSox@lindseyrbhair @Suns Yeah this is dope@its_khaleel @Suns I need oneThis is a friendly reminder that the Phoenix #Suns have the best record in the NBA and SHOULD have the top-two MVP candidates - if anybody outside The Valley was actually paying attention. #ValleyProud https://t.co/Ch77vehn9K@Suns He is the best thing that ever happened to the suns❤️☄️I think the Boston Celtics &amp; Phoenix Suns are the 2 best teams in the league right now. I just don't see a team in the East that beats Boston. Unless Ben Simmons comes back that's a rough matchup for Brooklyn. They need Simmons against Boston.@ShonaCleary @Suns Seriously I am jelly!! Lol@William18378078 @Suns oh shit did u talk to Giannis about that??? He told you that?!?! Wow good for you that u got to talk to the best player in the nba! And I think you meant “Giannis couldn’t care less” boss man🙃Your turn now @Suns https://t.co/F5DE35aNld@sixers y’all gonna be ready for the run and gun @Suns no super team in us just straight ballers 💯.Top 2 teams in the NBA.

1. Phoenix Suns
2. Memphis Grizzlies@its_khaleel @Suns Nice!@jj_redick people are turinng a blind eye to the phoenix suns for god knows whyThe C’s are at home when they play the Timberwolves tomorrow and the Sixers play the Suns in Phoenix. C’s win and the Sixers lose tomorrow and the C’s is the #1 seed. ☘️ https://t.co/GCdB8OpTjSThat matchup against the Suns in the next few games will be massive. Theyve beat them once in their building. Man if they beat them again with the way Phoenix ia playing now? Y'all won't be able to shut me up. They really can do this.@BALLYSPORTSAZ @Suns @BALLYSPORTSAZ when is your network going to be available on more mainstream platforms? A lot of @Suns and @Dbacks fans are unable to watch the games. Get that 💩 figured out.@CoachRyanMiller @memgrizz @NBA I know you've got to support your guy Bane, but my Phoenix Suns would like a word, Coach.Charley the Memphis Grizzlies are the real deal. I can't wait for the match up with @Suns for who wins the Western Conference.. because clearly they are the two best teams in the conference.@theparquetfloor @titans4L_ @SportsCenter @Suns maybe you watch basketball but probably time to see the ophthalmologist because those eyes be deceiving you 🤷‍♂️@Jumpshot8 @NBA @DevinBook @Suns Been saying this all year, EJ. It blows my mind that Book hasn't been discussed as an MVP candidate. The last few weeks without CP3 and Cam Johnson have solidified his case IMO.“The Phoenix Suns are legit”
https://t.co/1NF7oU1X6o@Jumpshot8 @NBA @DevinBook @Suns Anti-Book bias. But fine - give him more motivation@Tip4thetop @titans4L_ @SportsCenter @Suns That’s cute Scott, but let’s reserve the chatter for those that actually watch basketball.Got an alert that only 1 of my final 4 teams are alive. Couldn’t even see it cuz the dagum @SUNS was so bright.@WatinForDaTrain @415_mattt @ramon_rican Griz are dominating without ja. Give me the suns every day and twice on Sunday, way more holes to attack on PhoenixLet us pray!

Lord Jesus please do not let my Sixers get blown out tomorrow against the best team in the NBA, the Phoenix Suns! https://t.co/DW48Pk4tGoIf you're a Suns fan, support the team buy purchasing their OFFICIAL merch.

They play both ends of the court...100%...all the time.@Jumpshot8 @Suns @NBA I think people misconstrue Value, as “best player” in the league. Suns would have won with or without Booker. Nugs ain’t winning anything without Joker.  Efficiency stats show Value.Aside from @warriors and @Suns , what team(s) who beat the 29 teams in NBA this season ? #NBATwitter@HonestBucksFan @Suns Giannis could care less if coach Bud won..goes to show the difference between the teams@Suns @DeandreAyton @mikal_bridges Yep, let's lock up DA.

The Grizz have 1 all star and Suns have 2 that didn’t start!@its_khaleel @Suns So cool. Monty-ism 'WELL DONE IS GREATER THAN WELL SAID!!!@Jumpshot8 @NBA @DevinBook @Suns It's a three horse race. Embiid, Jokic or Greek Freak. 

Ja, Luka, DeRozan, Curry, Bron, Booker, and Tatum are just twitter conversations.@Jumpshot8 @NBA @DevinBook @Suns IMO Booker is being penalized for being on a good team. It seems everyone has their own definition of MVP. If it means your team would really such without you then maybe Giannis or Joker is your guy. Best player on best team then it’s Book.@Suns What a class act!!@HeatvsHaters Heat Nation, I announce with bitter sweet emotion that I am leaving the franchise after ten long years. I am taking my talents to Phoenix to pursue my new goals as a part of the Suns.

Thank you, Heat Nation. https://t.co/JKxmlf5xi3@DiabeticHeatFan @Suns Arizona literally owns the heat@lindseyrbhair @Suns That’s sweet!

Are the Suns being disrespected? Yes. What are they gonna do about it? https://t.co/u3lBBkcrF9 via @azcentralNBA Championship contenders (in order):

14 more wins than Giannis  
14 more wins than Embiid
17 more wins than Jokic 

Yet Steph Curry was high on MVP ladder last year as an 8th seed and was eliminated by Memphis! No consistency in todays @NBA for MVP!@BALLYSPORTSAZ @Suns Will this one bring the title? 🙏🙏🙏Phoenix Suns in history, results https://t.co/qBQQJxtyJW@juanv_910 @campayne @Suns Do this pic :) https://t.co/lXhG6Uy233@thurmari @NBA @DevinBook @Suns No, but I have a book and a job for you cleaning my yard@Jumpshot8 @NBA @DevinBook @Suns So you would have Booker ahead of Giannis and Jokic if you had a vote?@Jumpshot8 @NBA @DevinBook @Suns Jokic and Giannis have the stats. Booker doesn’t have historic stats. Those two are having all time seasons. It’s not the same.@tracywine105 @NBA @DevinBook @Suns Then he would never be qualified for MVP. U really struggle with your own narrative@Zona623_ @Jumpshot8 @NBA @DevinBook @Suns The Nuggets are only half a game from being in the play in.@Jumpshot8 @NBA @DevinBook @Suns So Al Horford is an All-star? Jrue was an All-Star in 2013.🤣@TaylorCope1982 @MakersMark If you’re a fan of The Phoenix Suns, you probably think this is cool. And that’s just fine.@tracywine105 @NBA @DevinBook @Suns So Holiday is not an all-star. Once one always one. Another bad analogy. You struggling@Jumpshot8 @NBA @DevinBook @Suns Wait until he gets his guys back next season. https://t.co/AyyE0d6jcK@Jumpshot8 @NBA @DevinBook @Suns He has one All-Star this season and he is having one of the best seasons ever.@tracywine105 @NBA @DevinBook @Suns How stoop was that when the Suns have already won 60 and could win 68. Lol.@Jumpshot8 @NBA @DevinBook @Suns Will be happy with Bbn ook winning MVP of the playoffsTook a walk with no real direction in mind. 

My body took me west on Sunset. 

Catholics are supposed to "genuflect", aka kneel, before alters, I did this without thinking, just as the sun hit me.

My ghost friend River Phoenix wanted to remind everyone to party responsibly. https://t.co/mm8D75q96D@EricStokesSzn6 @Suns Clearly folks do, even you cared enough to comment trying to claim, that no one cared.......  Just sayin@tracywine105 @NBA @DevinBook @Suns Answer the question  Giannis has two All Stars@Jumpshot8 @NBA @DevinBook @Suns Booker is great, but no one outside of Phoenix has him ahead of those three. He might finish fourth.@HawksInsiders You need a squad more than a best 22 in Covid times. Look at the Phoenix suns in the NBA, continuing to win with Booker and Paul missing stretches of game. Mitchell is building a best 30@tracywine105 @Jumpshot8 @NBA @DevinBook @Suns False. Too many cooks in the kitchen, DA is a better roll partner for CP3/Book and not enough defense. They'd win less games.@Legodrules @WilliamTheodor3 @NBA @DevinBook @Suns That’s why I call them stoops.@Jumpshot8 @Nightmare7379 @tracywine105 @NBA @DevinBook @Suns Beat the Suns challenge?@tracywine105 @NBA @DevinBook @Suns Giannis has 2 all stars on his team.  I know it’s hard for you.@Suns @DevinBook Updated this for you https://t.co/440RKxtJ0y@Jumpshot8 @NBA @DevinBook @Suns No, but it’s Jokic, Embiid and Giannis in the top three. Booker isn’t in the top three.@Nightmare7379 @tracywine105 @NBA @DevinBook @Suns And might not make the playoffs. 😂@Jumpshot8 @NBA @DevinBook @Suns "He has to many good teammates"... https://t.co/1swXvRdrbN@Jumpshot8 @tracywine105 @NBA @DevinBook @Suns Its Most-Valuable-Player though, Booker Isn’t close to the most valuable player In the league, the Suns would still be a 5-6 seed without him, Jokic Is carrying a team with 2 max contract guys not playing, without him, Nuggets are probably sitting In the bottom of the conference@Jumpshot8 @NBA @DevinBook @Suns NBA MVP votes should go back to the players and only the players. They're the ONLY ones who know the truth.@Jumpshot8 @WilliamTheodor3 @NBA @DevinBook @Suns I'm amazed people couldn't get that. Sometimes Twitter amazes me. Not in a good way..😅@kray1voice @Jumpshot8 @NBA @DevinBook @Suns Don’t forget the earth is also flat hahaha@tracywine105 @Jumpshot8 @NBA @DevinBook @Suns Jokic as the 6th gets considered but LeBron who’s 100 times better if he was the 6th seed gets no consideration nor can he win it when they had the best record in the Championship Year.@Legodrules @WilliamTheodor3 @NBA @DevinBook @Suns Exactly.@1011ap4 @Jumpshot8 @NBA @DevinBook @Suns Reasons why YOU don't count. 
1) You're a pathetic VIRGIN.
2) You're JOBLESS 
3) You're name is ALEX.@tracywine105 @NBA @DevinBook @Suns You wasted all that for what? So you believe a person can be MVP and be eliminated possibly from Play in?  Shhhh@Jumpshot8 @NBA @DevinBook @Suns Because the Sky is Green and 2x2=5 n the World of all those "Experts"! 🤯 https://t.co/8gLARAUMbj@Jumpshot8 @NBA @DevinBook @Suns Eddie…. Embiid is the MVP period.@Jumpshot8 @NBA @DevinBook @Suns They said book isn’t fancy enough! Doesn’t dunk like Giannis or shoot 3s like Steph, he doesn’t stand out! Absolutely the worst take I ever heardIn 2005, the Phoenix Suns led the league in made 3’s per game with 9.5

Right now that would be good for dead last in the league. Offenses have changed in the league pretty substantially. To say guys don’t play defense is insulting.

College players are also notably worse scorers https://t.co/ekz7sLmeim@Jumpshot8 @NBA @DevinBook @Suns Eddie, what’s your cocktail of choice?@Jumpshot8 @NBA @DevinBook @Suns 👆🏾Make it make sense.@Jumpshot8 @NBA @DevinBook @Suns ??? Tweet doesn't make sense. If you're talking about LeBron, nobody is talking about him as MVP in the last month.@Jumpshot8 @NBA @DevinBook @Suns Put Jokic on the Suns and they win 70 +. Put Booker on the Nuggets and probably miss the postseason. Suns are insanely deep and Jokic has no help. I like Booker a lot, but he’s not Jokic.@Jumpshot8 @NBA @DevinBook @Suns Book and Cp are going to cancel each other out for the MVP. Personally, I'm rooting for EmbiidCeltics finish first and sweep the first round en route to a 7 game series with the Phoenix Suns. JB for MVP.Just give the whole Phoenix Suns team MVP. That should be more fun https://t.co/wgtmRkddQS@Suns @DeandreAyton @mikal_bridges If Mikal or Deandre ever leave the Suns, that with be the saddest day of my life. I PRAY they stay on the Suns for their entire career.Go @Suns! WIN WIN WINOnly in 2022 @nba can a player possibly win MVP and could be in the Play In game and out of the playoffs, while a player @DevinBook  @Suns could win 68 games and possibly lap the entire NBA by plus 10 games!

@NBA | @Suns | #ValleyProud https://t.co/jA4qEy0xhU@KendrickPerkins MVP voting is 100% subjective. There are, literally, zero parameters for MVP. There are also zero statistical standards. However, there is an historical standard. If this was a court of law, @DevinBook would win the MVP w/o question. @Suns https://t.co/FxrdYoc0uXPhoenix SunsMagic Johnson had one of his greatest regular season performances on this day in 1989 to down the Phoenix Suns in a tight battle.  https://t.co/dWfA09LMsY
