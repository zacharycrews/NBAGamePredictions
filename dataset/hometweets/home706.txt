Papa Flynn needs to chill also bc every parent wants their kid to play more. Flynn is a grown man who has to show it if he wants minutesI’m looking at all the hornets players stories and all I see is the cn tower.  They are looking to show out in an empty gym  and to link a Toronto shordy after. The raptors need to be aggressive from the beginning. Idc.@TrueNorth2019 @AaronBenRose @Raptors Yeah one can wish haha! Yeah maybe picks? I feel like the Mavs side is a bit much but Brunson is on an expiring. KP has been better but I feel the defense still lacks and injuries. Probably not a good thing when Boucher averages more blocks/rebounds with less minutes than KP@dbui499 @AaronBenRose @Raptors I agree, I would assume management is tired of the Mom and Dad drama orbiting him as well. Its too bad as he does have the odd moment of clarity and he plays great. Unfortunately those moments seem to be few and far between.@superfresh223 @AaronBenRose @Raptors I feel like most teams would rather have Flynn also but I just feel like giving up on him after two years is early even with his struggles. Sell high rather than his low point. I trust whatever Masai or BW do. Til then one can just wish with overdoing the trade machine 😅@dbui499 @AaronBenRose @Raptors The Mavs don't even consider this for 30 seconds. Nevermind KP (who's having a really good season and they're not even getting close to equal value here), Brunson is their FVV lite and probably their third best player@Raptors @TangerineHoops Got my new jersey in the mail today.
