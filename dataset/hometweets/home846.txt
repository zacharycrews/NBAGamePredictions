Hey, @dallasmavs tried their best to build something with KP and @luka7doncic and it didnt work. It happens.Looking at KP, he seems happy almost expecting the trade. And looking at what @dallasmavs got in return, it seems like moving him was a more of a necessity for them, like they were forced to move him even.
