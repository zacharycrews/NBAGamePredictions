You know like the old Boston Celtics coach,Red Auerbach.I know it looks really bad @Lakers fans , getting whipped by a lousy Boston Celtics team, but look at the bright side, this is the game that gets Vogel fired..cause if not this game, then what????The elite defense of the Boston Celtics 😄 https://t.co/6VkikdZxdV@CSmoove_Sports Boston Celtics have a CENTER THAT CAN MAKE 3-POINTERS. 😒😒😒
Sure wish the Lakers had Marc Gasol so he could be at the Top of Key running 5-Out Offense.It’s only one team I despise being dragged by. That’s the Boston Celtics 🤮Jayson Tatum with the sweet scoop of Honey Nut Cheerios for Carmelo Anthony! ☘💪🏾 #BostonCeltics #BeatLA @CausewayStreet https://t.co/1Hp4l6Zn4y@BigBankPicks @UnwrittenRul3s Now look at that piece of crap 3rd Quarter. Here’s what Coach Vogel is thinking, let them try to win the 3rd Quarter without Rondo . They screwed that up, so I will use Rondo at some point in the 4th Quarter in Boston Celtics killer mode.I love what Al Horford brings to this team. He’s a hard nose team player that brings a certain level of professionalism and leadership to the locker room. #BigAl  #Veteran #BostonCelticsLos Angeles Lakers VS.
