@JoshEberley There’s plenty of those to choose from, unfortunately. I’ll go with the 2014-15 Minnesota Timberwolves. Had just traded Kevin Love. Ricky Rubio and Nikola Pekovic missed most of the year. Traded a first for Adreian Payne. Traded Thad Young for an expiring 38-year old KG. All bad.Denver Nuggets vs Minnesota Timberwolves Live Stream - NBA Today

The New York Knicks, Los Angeles Lakers, Minnesota Timberwolves, Sacramento Kings, Portland Trail Blazers, Indiana Pacers and Cleveland Cavaliers”Minnesota Timberwolves are the worst franchise in NBA history

They'd be as screwed as the Minnesota Timberwolves are in the NBA (probably worse because they're a whole time zone ahead of everyone else in the conference)The Minnesota Timberwolves have the lowest all-time winning percentage amongst active franchises, at 39.4%.

The lowest winning percentage of any franchise (active or defunct) belongs to the original Denver Nuggets, who went 11-51 (17.7%) in 1949-50, their lone NBA season. https://t.co/cflUOCE6Sx@ElmerSWellsJr @ErnieBillings1 @frankieflakes21 The Minnesota Timberwolves holds the senior class 25 TM on “Wolves” for a professional sporting entity!

https://t.co/bPtyZS1n36@StephanHart @kevinsheehanDC The issue wasn't Arkansas State, though I'm sure they had a small part of it. It was the Minnesota Timberwolves. They own the "Wolves" moniker, and they don't want a bigger entity (NFL) using it because it'll make more money than their NBA likeness, so the T-Wolves shut it down.📰 Denver Nuggets vs Minnesota Timberwolves Predictions and Odds Feb 1!
