Spurs https://t.co/VaZGxBvPiMGolden State acquiring Jakob Poetl from San Antonio is  interesting. He is a great defender, smart, high IQ, a good decision maker at the 5 with great hands as a roller in PnR. He is Andrew Bogut-like

For the Spurs, they get a raw C prospect It's a tantilising for the Spurs https://t.co/OKKSj5hNUbThis would be a great move by the Phoenix Suns if they could acquire Thaddeus Young from the San Antonio Spurs.

Young has been one of the most underrated players over his entire career and would help PHX

Dario Saric would be a nice pick up in San Antonio's system. An even trade https://t.co/JlbVVqRHTMThe Celtics' team bus broke down in San Antonio today, hours before their game vs. the Spurs will tip off.

Betting Trends &amp; Prediction: https://t.co/k7hzASsQ5h@Luca3Brasi @RealTalk900 You do know that as talented as Rodman was, the Spurs traded him because he hated being in San Antonio and was a constant distraction, right? Specifically during the playoffs when he was too busy diddling Madonna. He was a negative, not a positive.
