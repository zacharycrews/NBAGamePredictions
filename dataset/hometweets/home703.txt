https://t.co/wJuGsCYFDRLooking through old Suns-Jazz photos. Totally forgot Mark Jackson and John Starks played for Utah at one point. Also wild how many Utahns forget Hornacek played for (and was an All-Star with) Phoenix.CP3 has logged 12+ assists 17 times this season, the most such games in the #NBA.

He had 12+ dimes just 16 times in three full seasons with the Thunder and Rockets.

That game is counted in both figures.Unique element of this batch of Suns injuries that we haven't seen this year is Payton was used essentially as another wing when Phoenix got shorthanded. Now he's running the offense so we're going to see a fair bit of Wainright tonight I think.

Pacers "good D" collapsed on a non-shooter.

The right play was 18 dive to the front of the rim.
If he were to pass, and he shouldn't, then pass to his right.
