The Pelicans are still on a high after their 20 point comeback and win against the Lakers. However, we cannot say the same for Portland as they have lost 14 out of their last 16 games.

What are the odds Portland comes back? https://t.co/xNOMX4lCtV@TheWhittyRyan @KevinCalabro @brookeolzendam @trailblazers Amazing!
