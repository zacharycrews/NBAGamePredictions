He can’t seem to pronounce the word “the” or anything with an “L” in it.

Thus, “the Golden State Warriors” become “da Goaden State Warriors.”

Matt Barnes is already a much better speaker than Draper, who to me sounds like Barney Rubble 😅yo like how you jamaican but don’t like golden state warriors you worried about the wrong curry 😭😭LETS GO @warriorsNow this bullshit how the fuck klay didn’t make top 75 @NBAonTNT @stephenasmith @NBA @warriors @warriorsworld #klaythompsontop75Just saw a Muggsy Bogues jersey at the @warriors game.

Sports don’t succeed if half the country isn’t watching.Golden State Warriors started pretty solid this season. Juan Toscano-Anderson talked about the deep roster of his team and the mood in the locker room.

Here's where you can catch a game when the Golden State Warriors are not in town. #OurGateIsOpen https://t.co/WLtSBO0UAs@WarriorNationCP It is scary....the approach to winning B-Ball by the Golden State Warriors.  Floor spacing, ball movement, and cutting to the basket.  Steph always draws more of his share of defenders.  The open man scores....that simple!@justlynnagain @warriors As advertised; Steph's proven to have his very own area code.@gswcowboy @ButcherBoy415 @JamesKincaid @warriors @ChaseCenter @957thegame @senorsisig @BontaHill This 💯@A_Case_of_TN @jsk1030 @hornets @warriors @nbatopshot @dapperlab @TheNBPA Also....im 30mins away in Charlotte! https://t.co/VT1stPfQmA@SLAMonline @warriors If only there was one person guarding my man we would see more of this...  good god hes amazingHey all! Tune in tonight for the #DubNation’s opener! 

@warriors will look for a similar performance since their opening win on the road vs @Lakers as they head home to the Chase Centre to continue their season against @LAClippers 

#DubNation #NBATwitterLive https://t.co/RkTSAQZMtI@Worrido_SK @warriors He averaged 16 6 6 on 26% usg in his rookie season. He’s got the size and can improve defensively with ease imo. A player that good is fitting on any team itl, I’m sorry, but there’s no need to overthink this.

He’s also a way better playmaker than Poole.@Boosh_TK @jsk1030 @hornets @warriors @nbatopshot @dapperlab @TheNBPA We shall bombard you, @hornets , w/ inquiries of @nbatopshot plans for #AllFly set holders.

We are persistent, well educated and good looking.

Ok, I'm fibbing just a little, BUT, you at least don't have to fly us to the stadium, I'll drive the 3 hrs 😎

The Magic are doin' it."Each day the price goes down. I'd be shocked if the #Warriors wouldn't be interested in trading for [Ben Simmons]."

@Scalabrine on the Simmons situation and whether Golden State should make a call.

A bet has been placed for $8,070.66 on Golden State Warriors - Los Angeles Clippers to win $18,078.28.
To view this bet or copy it https://t.co/9aRZcyrgbs https://t.co/4YshuoiHlh@brady_rhoades @KDTrey5 @warriors @FirstTake @russwest44 Just depends on who they get matched up with in the first 2 round I think. If Klay is Klay, then they have Jordan Poole off the bench acting as a better Livingston from 2015 era. Not saying they would but I’d never count them out with how they can score and chemistry for yearsThe Clippers have won five of six matchups against the Warriors since Golden State's 4-2 playoff series victory in 2019. Los Angeles also opened its 2019-20 season with a game on the road against the Warriors, winning that matchup, 141-122. https://t.co/s9nspg7vHD@himynameistime Haha it's actually a @warriors shirt!

Someone is going to eventually get seriously injured. Need a pedestrian crossing light. Plz act before it's too late.Idk how @MiamiHEAT fans wouldn’t love Spoelstra.
