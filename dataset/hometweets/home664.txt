They really need another big for a potential Giannis matchup in the playoffs. Something like Derrick Jones Jr and 2 second round picks for Serge could be good for both teams@chicagobulls @ACFresh21 @CobyWhite Coby:- "good to have you back, you gonna be ok tonight?"

Second, again playing in a crappy diluted league (6 new team were added 88-96) without zone/double teams made it possible for a player like MJ to get the scoring titles.

My memory might be off, but I believe they ranked 8th in defense when he last played, and they're now ranked 20th.

His absence had a ripple effect on Chicago's entire defense. https://t.co/lYpqGbDCdcThe Chicago Bulls say that Alex Caruso and Tyler Cook will be available for tonight's game.@971TheDrive Been to Chicago Bulls game!Should they both make it to the postseason, who will have a deeper run?

#nft #BULLSNBEARSWA #ChicagoBulls@rajonrondos @daBearsfan46d @chicagobulls At the end of the day I think gobert for vooch and pwill alone is selling low on pwill. Patrick is still on a rookie deal and can get even better and be more valuable moving forward. If anything you move Coby because you have to pay him first.@chicagobulls @nba_paint @ATT Lauri's revenge game incoming. We need full team back to win again. Without 2-3 rotational guys hard to win playing Bulls small agressive way.My love language is The Chicago Bulls.

WEAKKKK@LegionHoops *clears throat* @chicagobulls@chicagobulls @ZachLaVine @chicagobulls &amp; @ZachLaVine how can I purchase this exact jersey in a size 56 authenticBeing on Tate’s team is like being on the Chicago Bulls in 96’.

Jordan was so tenacious, so immune to losing, so PROFESSIONAL.

If you were around him, his energy would automatically make you better.

That’s how the Bulls won so many titles.@Reynald03003553 How am I trippin? Did I say he couldnt hoop? 

What I do know is that if he was traded to Chicago, he ain't about to be the primary option. Bulls have Demar and Zach, he jumping ahead and taking over the team?

That's what he wants. He wants to be the man wherever he goes.@chicagobulls @windycitybulls 5 straight lost tomorrow.@chicagobulls work together on fastbreaks a lot of blown ones lately going by yourself when you guys have numbers@NoDunksInc @chicagobulls @memgrizz 4 and half minutes of gold!Coby White Defends Nikola Vucevic Recent Play &amp; Reacts to Chicago Bulls Loss vs. Memphis Grizzlies
