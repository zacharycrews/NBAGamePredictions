This is ridiculous!!!!We’re in here @SacramentoKings! #SacramentoProud https://t.co/gr4LHnPAxTNo Moe Harkless tonight for the Sacramento Kings. Three guard starting lineup? Tristian Thompson?Before he sings the National Anthem &amp; performs at halftime of tonight's Kings home opener, Gammy nominated artist Montell Jordan spoke with some Sacramento youth advocates and community leaders. He also talked to me about being @TheDougChristie  college roommate. @montelljordan https://t.co/ZzlOpFHknoThe Sacramento Kings have never won a home opening night game at Golden 1 Center.

Can that change tonight? 🤔@SacramentoKings yuhh@megalutou @SacramentoKings @WhoIsJonWilson @momoragan @NBCSKings Thanks. Hope so. It’ll be a while. I live in Arizona so it’ll take some planning to get to Golden 1.Had bought the worst seats for opening night for the @SacramentoKings game and just got upgraded to some sideline tickets@KyleDeming1 @SacramentoKings @swipathefox 2-0 book it!One of our many rescues we currently have..

My buddy said that they probably have a deal with the @SacramentoKings to shut off resale over 30 mins before tip off to *make you go to Ticketmaster*.  And I guess season ticket holders know they also don’t let you resell on StubHub.  Awful. https://t.co/MUDFaFOle5Awesome night!

The Jazz had the best record in the NBA last season.
I’m guessing the Kings remember getting dragged by the Jazz in that 22 point beat down late last year.

We have 10 million people in Portugal waiting for that answer. 🙂
#NBAnaSPORTTV https://t.co/oZKpdSic2b@SactownKings23 Gotta pay for the Golden1 Center.

@Eisenberg43 must be proud. LolIn this model the Sacramento King’s forward Louis King would be the second best prospect on the Hornets, comfortably ahead of Bridges/PJ/Bouk… That’s why looking at anything through advanced analytics only is dangerous, lazy analysis https://t.co/s4KQxgKVapToday's NBA Picks: 10:00 PM ET - Utah Jazz vs. Sacramento Kings - 18 PICKS AVAILABLE: https://t.co/w33rI1uIPj #nba𝗚𝗔𝗠𝗘𝗗𝗔𝗬

No offense to Kyle Draper but Koz is way better. Listening to the kings broadcast for game 1 hurt my ears. The fans deserve better.@SacramentoKings Lets go tyrese@LetsGoSac @KozNBCS @rlallian @NBCSAuthentic Can’t believe you aren’t calling the games for the @SacramentoKings or even in the building anymore.
