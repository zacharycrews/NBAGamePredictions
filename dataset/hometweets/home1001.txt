EIGHT-AND-A-HALF.

Still hard to believe.@blazersforreal As a Phoenix Suns fan I can answer on behalf all of us.... Sadly No@ncedawg @Wildcat3691 @Jumpshot8 @Suns @undisputed Look "son," Chris Paul had an injured shoulder, he was a liability against the Lakers in the first round last year, but the Lakers still couldn't beat these "regular season" Suns? They must really suck. Pretty sure CP3 was out for 2 games against Clips, but Clips still lost?Wow Van Grundy doubling down on the  “west is open with that injury to Chris Paul” @Jumpshot8 they just don’t want to give The @suns their respect. I understand you want to build some story, but there is no story, Sun aren’t blowing this."It's gonna be a wide open western conference" is a ridiculous take when the Phoenix Suns have an 8.5 game lead 😑“The west has opened up, the @Suns without Chris Paul they used to be 8 or 9 games up in the west” - SVG

*checks notes*

Suns are 8.5 games up in the west. 

The media just doesn’t know man.@Suns_Armband @Suns Go suns!WHERE CAN I GET A @DevinBook VALLEY JERSEY??????????? @Suns #Suns@Suns_Armband @Suns grew up here in AZ, been a fan my whole life

we used to go to the "SCOUT" nights in the 80's@RooBoy10 @Suns Woot woot!The Phoenix Suns have defeated every team in the NBA.  They are 40 games over .500 and lead the next best record by 8.5 games.  They clinched a playoff spot on March 9th.  It’s time for a real test.

Bring on the Lakers.@sickathehighhat @kirkgoldsberry @SwipaCam @NBABlackburn @Adam_Mares He is scrappy &amp; young &amp; gave LJ &amp; AD and the Lakers a spark.

I’m in Wisconsin so I’ll be rooting for the Bucks, but I lived in Phoenix for 20 years so I’ll be rooting for the Suns too.

#GoSuns@Mr_KStatum2U Honestly…I have not watched much NBA this year so I’m not as sure. I think Phoenix is the best team…but I’d prefer to think Denver or Memphis can win.

The East is a mess…I like the 76ers but can’t trust em. If pressed I’d go Suns/Bucks #2

If Draymond is strong tho. Warriors.Could the @sixers have given Steve Nash and @BrooklynNets the missing ingredients to win the EAST? And possibly play Nash former team @Suns in the Finals @NBAonTNT? How can give Seth Curry away and not get a Party Mills, Dragic, or Joe Harris back? https://t.co/uzYbxCADgmCongratulations to fzk, Jeffdw20, Nemi (@marknemi), treehousebandit, sarcastronaut, Shazaaaaam (@ShazaaaaamNFT), pepperballs (@realpepperballs) and elscorcho who moved up to take #3, #4, #5, #6, #7, #8, #9 and #10 on the Phoenix Suns team leaderboard.
