I am picking Nikola Jokic &amp; the Nuggets, he is naturally picking Devin Booker &amp; the Suns for the win.

Sacramento Kings win
Toronto Raptors win@Loggy_12 @Suns @SwireCC @FrysFoodStores No problem. I’d say expect an announcement at the beginning of the month for a release date sometime near Thanksgiving, but that’s just a guessReally Surprised that #DeandreAyton didn’t get a Max contract from the @Suns but I don’t question the leadership of James Jones (#NBA GM of the Year). Let’s see how he looks tonight in game 1 of the regular season.Can we say TROLL @Suns 😂 https://t.co/ejfJxldiCwThat phoenix suns front office is brilliant... No contract extension means Ayton bouta play his best ball after disappearing in the finals last year. I think it's a beautiful slap in the face.@Will_jasper24 @Suns @SwireCC @FrysFoodStores Appreciate you bro@Loggy_12 @Suns @SwireCC @FrysFoodStores I’m pretty sure that’s when they’re releasing them again. Due to high demand and probably cash in on the big holiday rush as well as opposed to trying to re-market them during that time. But Nov was always the mark I’ve heard from the connections I had at the beginning of the yr.@Suns @Verizon Pay DA and bring back valley jerseys to store@PhoenixSuns_ you all need to pay @DeandreAyton !!!

How to watch Phoenix Suns vs. Denver Nuggets on the Suns' opening night of the NBA season https://t.co/bK7EhuuJLN via @azcentral@NBA @Suns @nuggets But Jamal Murray isn't playing so the result of this game shouldn't count.  Only hypotheticals should count so that means Nuggets are 1-0 and Suns are 0-1.@SunsJAM @DKSportsbook @FDSportsbook @Suns Tonight about to be lit. Suns game at 7pm and right after hearing y’all talk about it. That’s a good 1, 2 combo 💪🏾Slippery slope @Suns@VBoyz22 @GlenardColeman @NBA @Suns @nuggets On god.

The Suns open their season vs. the Nuggets tonight at 10pm/et on ESPN. #KiaTipOff21 https://t.co/3lAgeYY8jz@Suns like I said might not be a good fit but Just think About it real hard. We need a 4 anyway yes we have jalen smith and yes I would like one that could shoot but this could be scary still. https://t.co/RYmh6YnxWE@Suns this might not be a good fit but we have so many shooters we really wouldn’t need Ben Simmons to shoot at all. He could take a lot of the PG duties off of CP’s hands which would open up more easy scoring opportunities for CP instead of always having to hit a step back 🤷🏽‍♂️Good morning to the Phoenix @Suns and all their fans.

#ValleyProud #4TheValley https://t.co/hDeU3x6s6fPanda Express spelled @Suns wrong 😡😡

💜🧡 https://t.co/jMEpb0tJFXOpening night without the @Suns is another slap in the face by the NBA &amp; TNT. https://t.co/3IBGt6A5Nf@BookersBurna @Patsnation87 @Suns Appreciate it! 🙌🙌Pat Connaughton took 13 shots tonight. 4 for 9 from 3point range.

If books keep setting his 3PM line at 1.5, it’s pretty obvious what to do.
