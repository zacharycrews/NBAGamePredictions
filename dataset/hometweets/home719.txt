Took the rail system from the airport to the hotel downtown. Stayed in walking distance of most things. Watched a Bulls game too. Pizza is the best. Saw the bean.

He’s been on fire since filling in as a starter, and he’s a testament to the idea that just because a rookie is older, doesn’t mean they’re a bad pick.

The total has gone "under" in the last five of six games between the Bulls and Raptors, in Chicago. The total has also gone "under" in the Raptors last five games on the road.

Tonight, they matchup in Chicago. The total is 219.5.

Trend says: Under 219.5@lemonwerewolf Ok I did a quick list of ones I’ve seen actual swatches for but there is probably more. For Colorpop specifically Main Squeeze, Sol, and Chicago Bulls are their palettes that more orange red. Then on the more expensive side there is Urban Decay Naked Heat or Morphe 3503@Keennologs @chicagobulls_12 @arturasfanclub @TheHoopCentral @NBA A Magic fan talking about "poverty years"?

Grant has inflated stats because he plays for Detroit. Stats in Denver:

I believe the local schools mandated the teaching that the 1985 Bears were the best team in all of sports - ever (despite all the facts to the contrary) for at least 20 years. "Yeah the Jordan Bulls were good, but not that them '85 Bears...."@chicagobulls @TheNikkoTan @AyoDos_11 @IlliniMBB He’s back in Champaign tonight!!Hey @chicagobulls please trade for Derrick rose if we trade Coby white for a pf 😃The Charlotte Hornets used to have one of the hottest sports brands in the 90's. Outside of Chicago Bulls gear you'd see a lot of Hornets jerseys, hats, jackets etc worn for "style". Now their jerseys say "CHA" with a number underneath and it looks like no effort was put into it.@ShowOGenius @chicagobulls @J30_RANDLE no doubt!The city of CHICAGO SPORTS ARE TRANSFORMING RIGHT BEFORE OUR EYES..
.SKY, BULLS AND BEARS ARE TRENDING UPWARDS
