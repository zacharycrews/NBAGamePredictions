  #GoCavs@MikeJudge1027 @cavs Enjoy the game, Mike!@JordanZirm I am okay if they let him leave.

 I know it is trade season, but in my humble opinion @cavs still don't know what adding Windler and Sexton to this mix will do.

  I would wait to see that, before I bring in someone new.

https://t.co/rZTIbf9MjL@cavs @keybank All Star https://t.co/jM8jiUlDfw@icecoldmjc @cavs Sexton isn‚Äôt really part of the core now.@EdGreenberger @cavs Then they really just need to move on to someone like Gordon or Terrance Ross. LeVert would be nice, but not worth giving up a piece of the core for a year and a half of him. Especially when history indicates he will only play about half of that time.@EdGreenberger @cavs If you‚Äôre talking about Sexton or Okoro then yes I‚Äôd be upset if either of those guys left. Okoro will continue to develop on O and already plays great D we would miss.

In return we get Kevin Pangos a much a better PG than we have already.I have a hard time believing that you watch Cavs games if you want to trade Isaac Okoro.

It would be stupid for the Cavs to trade Isaac Okoro.

Have you seen how much better Darius Garland is in his third season or no?

(Sumber: Kyle Neubeck)Most of the random trade proposals being written about by people on here don't really improve the team.

Making a trade just to make a trade is a bad call.

Suns and Warriors own the Westü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èHell, the Jazz, Nuggets &amp; Grizzlies would knock them out too.

Winning without Markannen is huge.  And we will add a player, no doubt about it .@matthewlubbeck @cavs 3rd in the East, 9th in the Westüòë@LaVidaLysandra @cavs You are spot on.  It's a superstar and large market team.   If this same exact team in Boston or Miami, they would be on much more.  It's not the team, it's the market.  They loved us with LeBron, but it was LeBron driving the ratings, not the team.@matthewlubbeck @cavs The Cavs don‚Äôt have the ‚Äúbig name SUPERSTARS‚Äù that the league wants. Too bad too‚Ä¶@joshgargiulo @cavs @Lakers @KingJames so you‚Äôre saying the lakers front office is to blame@LaVidaLysandra @cavs It's amazing the NBA wouldn't want to showcase a team like the Cavs.  Change the schedule to get them air time.   The NFL flexes its schedule, why can't the NBA.  It's not a good game or product.If the @cavs had fucked up the roster and asset situation as bad as the @Lakers have, the entire narrative would be ‚Äúwhere will @KingJames go to?‚Äù Instead, people are out here trying to figure out how other teams can donate talent to help them. Laughable.Watching this shit, the @cavs deserve way more national games than the Lakers.
