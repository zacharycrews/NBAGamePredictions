In the history of pop culture or sports I‚Äôm not sure we‚Äôve seen this level of revenge @HPbasketballComing into tonight, the Toronto #Raptors were a team the #Cavs needed to keep an eye on as a team who could knock us into the "play-in". However, the Raps are losing by 17 right now late in the 3rd qtr. #LetEmKnowAND THE DNA TEST IS IN.

IN THE CASE OF THE TORONTO @Raptors....
