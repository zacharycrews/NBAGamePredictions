2. Because of that, the Suns can only offer him a deal up to $4.7M. 

3. Since Indiana traded for Smith, they inherit the restrictions that Phoenix had. 

4. So Indiana can only sign him for a max salary of $4.7M.Phoenix Suns Shooting Guard Gail Goodrich recorded 37 Points, 6 Rebounds, and 6 Assists in this game.On this day in sports history March 4, Cincinnati Royals Point Guard Oscar Robertson recorded 23 Points, 7 Rebounds, and 20 Assists in a 141-122 win against the Phoenix Suns in 1969.Consensus Line Move:

"What is this good cop, psycho cop routine?"
"World greatest detectives? What a joke!"Also, I love this interpretation of Riddler. Paul Dano, again, knocking it out of the park.The Batman arc is truly compelling story. Batman has thousands different comics and interpretations and I thought Reeves did well how well he pulled the good stuff from those source materials.Saw #TheBatman yesterday, what a fucking movie. The best portrayal of Batman on screen in a decade. Pattinson and Kravitz is fucking perfect. Turturro and Farrell steal every scenes they're in. Wright is Gordon to a tee in his early years
