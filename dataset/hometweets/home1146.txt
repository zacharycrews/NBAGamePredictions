Sure, it helps to have more users (investors), but I don’t see how it’s any different from any other collectible.

Genuinely curious.@Aalaysha93 My point with my response is that numbers only take an argument so far. 2014-2015 Atlanta Hawks were 60-22. They were overrated nor did they win anything. I’m not saying the suns are a bad team just over rated 🤷🏽‍♂️@ATLHawks @hellodapper @nbatopshot Let's gooooo@ChubertTS @fuckingcorndogs @ATLHawks @hellodapper @nbatopshot Yeah, they're more like pyramid schemes than Ponzi schemes.@ATLHawks @Clorox I forgot he even played for Hawks..Cleveland Cavaliers at Atlanta Hawks odds, picks and predictions

If it wasn’t for Trae, this team definitely would not make playoffs. He is the most valuable player for the Hawks@ra_quis @ATLHawks @TheTraeYoung I understand the point you’re trying to make, but the MVP is an individual award and shouldn’t be based off team performance@HaroldKilgour @HawksOnBally @TheTraeYoung @ATLHawks He should be averaging 28/12. Can’t force his teammates to capitalize on wide open looks.
