Would be such an entertaining experience üòÇ@s24taofeek @hornets @CrownClubCLT Don't like that at all about them trying to helped the Ukraine situation let the White Ukrainians and Russians destroy each other stay out of it.

Spread: DAL -1.5 (@FDSportsbook)

üì∞ Charlotte has found new life recently, winning 3 in a row as they fight for a spot in the play-in tournament. Dallas is coming off a tough loss to Philly last night.(4/4) These show how Charlotte frustrated Trae into 9 points, a season-low, with their traps. There were a couple of times Trae split before the big showed, but the gameplan was executed very well.

It'll be interesting to see how the #Hornets defend Luka tonight. He's different. https://t.co/YXDfFSazSD@1NikkiAnn3 Good morning ma'am, there's Charlotte fc game and the Hornets, but it's a lot to do, one thing though, Charlotte have Uptown!!!

Is that really so much to ask? ... 

Correct: It is not ...

Some people just get screwed over in this life‚Äîit's just the way it is.@cgalloway704 @DaviJones52 @getchristyluv @HornetsNationCP Monk felt no role in Charlotte, no purpose‚Ä¶ can you tell me which role player in the hornets has a role ? 

#Jalen/Cody/Kelly/Trezz/Bouknight none of them has a set role, none of them know their role. 

Look at Caleb Martin in Miami.. his role is clearly defined and doing well.The Phoenix Suns will need to make shots to beat the Charlotte Hornets if they get Luka Doncic #AllFly #ValleyProud https://t.co/7KIQYkgjqTNBA Basketball Game Betting Picks Simulator: 3/19/2022 7:07 PM ET - Dallas Mavericks vs. Charlotte Hornets - YOU CAN RUN THE GAME SIMULATION FOR FREE HERE: https://t.co/6G8L7l1h3f #nba #sportsbetting #freepicks #cappertekMichael Jeffrey Jordan  American businessman and former professional basketball player.
