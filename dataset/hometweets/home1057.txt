Sometimes for the bigger games or when they expect bigger crowds, they open 30 minutes earlier than that for each of those times.  Uptown is going to be insane today.  There's the soccer match, a bar crawl and the Hornets game all at the same time!Much bigger play on the hornets PK vs Dallas tonight. Charlotte could easily win by 10-15. It’s Luka magic or a blowout without Spencer dinwiddie on the second of a back to back. Hornets are the #1 offense in the league and loaded with talent. Much better than their .500 record.@JWhitttz @hornets @Ticketmaster I've been waiting all season for it!!@EricBerman72 @hornets @Ticketmaster just found out myself haha https://t.co/x75J7j2yCT@s24taofeek @hornets @CrownClubCLT We need Dababy to have access to the snake head that is Michael Jordan.

@Ticketmaster | 🎟️: https://t.co/MiOkjg0PCa https://t.co/DXanrbAasF@s24taofeek @hornets @CrownClubCLT You got to remember Dababy is a regular mainstream rapper he is not a billionaire mogul like Drake, Jay Z, Sean Combs and Dr. Dre that have direct access to other billionaires such as team owners. Nelly have a small percentage in the Hornets even him I doubt have access to Jordan@TRUZZZ18 Baltimore Ravens and Charlotte Hornets@s24taofeek @hornets @CrownClubCLT We as lower and middle class Black people can't lived through these rich celebrities/politicians/CEOs thinking that we all overcame. We must continue the fight for justice for our people and eventually take back this whole planet that belongs to us from our oppressors.Can we get that Charlotte Hornets announcer to cover the Final 4? 

Would be such an entertaining experience 😂@s24taofeek @hornets @CrownClubCLT Don't like that at all about them trying to helped the Ukraine situation let the White Ukrainians and Russians destroy each other stay out of it. I want Dababy to speak out about Black justice in his songs like Tupac, Public Enemy and so many of our small independent rappers.NBA Player Props: Dallas Mavericks vs Charlotte Hornets - @GumbyVreeland has three plays for tonight's #mavs vs #hornets matchup - Luka, LaMelo, and Mason?!

Spread: DAL -1.5 (@FDSportsbook)

📰 Charlotte has found new life recently, winning 3 in a row as they fight for a spot in the play-in tournament. Dallas is coming off a tough loss to Philly last night.(4/4) These show how Charlotte frustrated Trae into 9 points, a season-low, with their traps. There were a couple of times Trae split before the big showed, but the gameplan was executed very well.

It'll be interesting to see how the #Hornets defend Luka tonight. He's different. https://t.co/YXDfFSazSD@1NikkiAnn3 Good morning ma'am, there's Charlotte fc game and the Hornets, but it's a lot to do, one thing though, Charlotte have Uptown!!!

The breakdown: 35-35 overall record, 22-22 vs the East, 13-13 vs the West, 17-17 at home, and 18-18 on the road.

Is that really so much to ask? ... 

Correct: It is not ...

Some people just get screwed over in this life—it's just the way it is.@cgalloway704 @DaviJones52 @getchristyluv @HornetsNationCP Monk felt no role in Charlotte, no purpose… can you tell me which role player in the hornets has a role ? 

#Jalen/Cody/Kelly/Trezz/Bouknight none of them has a set role, none of them know their role. 

Look at Caleb Martin in Miami.. his role is clearly defined and doing well.The Phoenix Suns will need to make shots to beat the Charlotte Hornets if they get Luka Doncic #AllFly #ValleyProud https://t.co/7KIQYkgjqTNBA Basketball Game Betting Picks Simulator: 3/19/2022 7:07 PM ET - Dallas Mavericks vs. Charlotte Hornets - YOU CAN RUN THE GAME SIMULATION FOR FREE HERE: https://t.co/6G8L7l1h3f #nba #sportsbetting #freepicks #cappertekMichael Jeffrey Jordan  American businessman and former professional basketball player.

They’re tough. GL brother!@TheDailyBettor_ @hornets Interesting seems like they want you to take the bait with Mavs. But tired legs might have Dallas defense little softer then the norm@TheDailyBettor_ @hornets Yea not sure what’s going on with this line? Is someone resting for mavs?@Chriscal2525 @OzGambler70 @JayMoneyIsMoney Interesting contrast in styles tmrw with Dallas @ Charlotte. Mavs on B2B and will want to keep pace slower and while the Hornets often go with the Def is optional game and get out and go.@EndlessJeopardy What are the Charlotte Hornets.

As of today,
The Charlotte Hornets are 22-22 in the Eastern Conference 

And the Hawks are 21-23 in the Eastern ConferenceFor the Charlotte Hornets to secure a tiebreaker over the Atlanta Hawks, they’ll have to sweep the rest of their division games(Heat,Magic,Wizards)

And the Hawks will have to lose their remaining division games(Wizards,Heat)@KingDark_Man @NgyTrends @Metr0_76 @PrincipeDylan @TheNBACentral Kemba owns countless records and he impacted Charlotte more than any other Hornet. Muggsy was also an incredible Hornet, but Kemba was different. He put Charlotte on his back and never asked for anything in return.
