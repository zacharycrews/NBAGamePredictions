But instead, @ESPNNBA is gonna show me the New York Nets blow out the New York Knicks (worst team in the NBA). Cool cool cool.Going to the @nyknicks Vrs @BrooklynNets tonight.

Little to no upside on that deal for New York.A veteran of 18 NBA seasons,Herb Williams was drafted 14th overall by the Indiana Pacers in the first round of the NBA Draft back in 1981.i'll always remember him more for his time playing and coaching for the New York Knicks.
