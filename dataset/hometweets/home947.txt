#TakeNote #WBD https://t.co/VAN7IBn5ebZion Williamson Questions Linger in New Orleans Despite Positive News - Sports Illustrated Pelicans Scoop News, Analysis and More https://t.co/zVVK0Fg8FD@dntcaresorrrry @DruProductions Mental how? Pelicans fans act like the scorn ex. Anthony Davis barely even acknowledged that he ever lived in New Orleans and y‚Äôall are always stalking him and the lakers. Making up some fake rivalry that doesn‚Äôt exist. It‚Äôs like comparing the Yankees to the RockiesCrazy draft situation: The Lakers pick goes to New Orleans this year if it's 1-10. It goes to Memphis if it's 11-30. Current estimate for that pick is #11 -- the Pelicans are exactly one game behind them. Very high incentive for NOP to pass LAL and beat them in the play-in.üèÄ The Jazz and Pelicans are each on three game winning streaks as they meet in New Orleans for their match up at 8 PM EST tonight. @SteveMerril provides data and insights surrounding the over/under for this game currently listed at 222.5.

üëâ https://t.co/j3AxHWoXTp https://t.co/TDitx5TlfyI wouldn't be so quick to think that. It's more so a city of New Orleans thing than it was a Sean Payton thing (look how they treat the Pelicans) although the SP hate didn't help any. https://t.co/VWC6CMIkaHParlay a few, play some straight
