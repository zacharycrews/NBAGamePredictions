Completely insane. So if you see people selling its very possible they’re just trying to cover their costs of going to a game or two each round.@Millions @PayPal @Suns M$ndeater93@PayPal @Suns @ohmygross_  I’d take you 🤣😊@ItWasAKindness @Free_Haiti6 Phoenix won Games 4-6 decisively by pushing the pace. It's why my Suns fan mutuals were talking a lot in the offseason about how they wanted Monty and CP3 to make an adjustment to play faster going into this season. Phoenix lost Gms. 2 and 3 playing at LeBron James' speed.So many incredible players in action tonight during the #NBAPlayoffs.

Dallas Mavericks vs. Phoenix Suns series opens up tonight with Game 1 at 10pm/et on NBA on TNT. https://t.co/hEiZ46JqYF@SportsSturm I think Suns win the series. You're right the Mavs have the best player on the court, but the problem is the 2nd, 3rd and 4th best players belong to Phoenix.Phoenix had more trouble than expected in Round 1, but should return to form in Game 1 of its second-round series vs. Dallas. The Suns have owned the Mavs over the last few years — and our NBA betting picks expect that to continue tonight.

#MFFL⭐️4 unit NBA Parlay⭐️

Dallas is 8-2 ATS last 10.
Dallas is 2/2 ATS vs the Suns in Phoenix. 
Suns are 21-23 ATS at home.
Love the Heat to win big at home tonight and I believe Mavericks cover.

You said earlier I have a Vagina.. 🤣🤣🤣 Your Twitter name befits you.. 🤣🤣🤣@SothaChill I moved to Phoenix in 96 so that's my onboarding time. Was in disbelief for that SB run, much like Suns last season, but ecstatic beyond belief.@Dick04819854 @JamesDeku_ @FWI_Warrior @NBAOfficial @memgrizz @PelicansNBA @Suns @Money23Green The basketball you know is street basketball where people get real physical and grab shirts without referees... that is not NBA. That is not professional sports! There are rules and rules have criterias! Are you a kid? How come you don't know this?The National Basketball Association (NBA) confirmed that they slapped the Phoenix Suns with a $25,000 fine due to their failure to disclose the specific injury status of superstar Devin Booker during Game 6

Much more for unnecessary and excessive contact! You do not know basketball@TheWardenofCLE All teams from New York, Boston, LA, and Philadelphia and the Phoenix Suns@yourguycharles @Suns Man, I hope so!@Dick04819854 @JamesDeku_ @FWI_Warrior @NBAOfficial @memgrizz @PelicansNBA @Suns @Money23Green Now have you played basketball?? Or you just watch and start thinking of conspiracies about NBA refs fixing games? 🤣🤣🤣@PurisimaBakery @Maris82894319 @Suns Great to know thank you!@azthread @Wainright24 @Suns We love you Wainwright!!❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️@Dick04819854 @JamesDeku_ @FWI_Warrior @NBAOfficial @memgrizz @PelicansNBA @Suns @Money23Green Getting hit with an elbow getting tripped, diving for a ball, landing awkwardly, is all part of the game! Grabbing the jersey mid air isn't..@6toHombreLATAM 76er vs Bucks y Golden state vs Phoenix Suns@Dick04819854 @JamesDeku_ @FWI_Warrior @NBAOfficial @memgrizz @PelicansNBA @Suns @Money23Green So grabbing a player by his jersey is what you define as part of a contact in basketball?? Really??@Dick04819854 @JamesDeku_ @FWI_Warrior @NBAOfficial @memgrizz @PelicansNBA @Suns @Money23Green Not sure how that is related to the definition of a flagrant foul penalty 2, but yeah, played primary till high school! You play football yeah? 🤣🤣🤣@kray1voice @Suns @NBAS @Jumpshot8 @NBA @BALLYSPORTSAZ We love you Eddie❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️@poyjuansengpue @JamesDeku_ @FWI_Warrior @NBAOfficial @memgrizz @PelicansNBA @Suns @Money23Green Intent moron. Intent. He intended to stop the guy from scoring. Kicking someone in the sack is different then stopping them from scoring in the middle of a play. You jump and contact happens. It’s a contact sport. I never cried when I got hit. I welcomed it. It’s part of the game@poyjuansengpue @JamesDeku_ @FWI_Warrior @NBAOfficial @memgrizz @PelicansNBA @Suns @Money23Green Have you ever played basketball? Serious question. Like legit organized basketball. High school or college? Not Rec ball. Have you played?@Dick04819854 @JamesDeku_ @FWI_Warrior @NBAOfficial @memgrizz @PelicansNBA @Suns @Money23Green Check again! So now you don't see my replies? Lol 🤣🤣🤣@Dick04819854 @JamesDeku_ @FWI_Warrior @NBAOfficial @memgrizz @PelicansNBA @Suns @Money23Green Lol of course he should think twice about grabbing people by their jerseys while mid air or kicking their balls for crying out loud.. 🤣🤣🤣 You are a funny troll.. 🤣🤣🤣 But not regukar defense. He does what he do best, defense, and just be mindful about Flagrant Fouls or Techs@Suns @Jumpshot8 Happy birthday Eddie, we all love you❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️@poyjuansengpue @JamesDeku_ @FWI_Warrior @NBAOfficial @memgrizz @PelicansNBA @Suns Read the rules casual. I see you didn’t respond to the tweet I sent out tagging him. He said if anyone on Twitter has the answers to why he was ejected to tag him and his show. I did so and you didn’t respond @Money23Green #draymondgreenshow@JamesDeku_ @poyjuansengpue @FWI_Warrior @NBAOfficial @memgrizz @PelicansNBA @Suns He literally said on his podcast prior to moments before the ejection that he thought twice about his actions. Like literally. Smh. St.fu you don’t follow the warriors or #draymondgreenshow @Money23Green@poyjuansengpue @Dick04819854 @FWI_Warrior @NBAOfficial @memgrizz @PelicansNBA @Suns Right lol, either way I don’t see Draymond playing differently regardless. After he got suspended in the 2016 finals and played cautious, he said he wouldn’t play differently. I don’t think a Flagrant 2 will have him rethinking life lol😂😅As a @warriors fan being invited to the @Suns game tomorrow night, what do I wear?@Suns @Ticketmaster High school games and college homecomingsPhoenix suns vs Golden state warriors would be epic as wcf.@demas6Basket Phoenix sunsRepping the @Suns circa the 90s!

Its definitely cool to look at tho@scooperhoops @TheNamesEdward If Luka and Jalen Brunson are exceptional, Phoenix is going to lose. But both have to be on the top of their games. If they're not, the Suns win. I think they will be, so I've got the Mavs in 6.Just caught the @dallasmavs takeoff going to Phoenix to take on the @Suns .
