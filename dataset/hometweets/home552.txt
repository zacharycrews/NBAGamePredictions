My dream trade would be for SGA, but that’s unrealistic. So i’d rather trade JuJu for Fox tbh. The Kings are also in dire need of PF too 👀@ToddyWoddy1330 @KnicksGolfChill @nyknicks Games aren’t shot creators and couldn’t create off the dribbleLet’s get the w tonight @nyknicks #newyorkforever https://t.co/ied2hX65UM@ToddyWoddy1330 @KnicksGolfChill @nyknicks Practice? These mfs practice everyday and alleging many excuses when you quite literally just said don’t make excuse with the randle is “nicked up” against the pistons.

Indiana Pacers vs New York Knicks

Myles Turner
Over 1.5 3 pt -109 @ BODOG

Myles has hit NYK for 11/21 from 3 pt land in 3 games.

Mitchell or Taj won’t go with him to the perimeter. Could be him or Sabonis, but he’s likely to try from 3 more often. https://t.co/YqbF0aQwhK@mahrezfort @KnicksGolfChill @nyknicks Let me get this straight, according to you, the coaching staff and teammates are all to blame for Randle’s poor play? And has absolutely nothing to with Randle? 💀@nyknicks 40 minutes from Thibs@nyknicks Randle and Fournier should be textbook post-up and spot-up respectively. Barret should be the slasher. It sounds simplistic but with a simple foundation if roles like that, productive creativity can flourish.@DJTrakstar @mahrezfort @ToddyWoddy1330 @m4mba824 @nyknicks bro watch tape in the last 2 games and even in the game before we run plays that benifit obi just cuz you don’t know the concepts of the scheme doesn’t mean there not benificial to obi with the horns spr and ds sets@mahrezfort @KnicksGolfChill @nyknicks Yeah bc a 2 game sample size of a  depleted roster with no chemistry due to lack of practice &amp; having adjusted their games to fit Randle doesnt factor into those 2 losses at all. 

Cont to go off as if these 2 losses were played with a healthy roster, + the return of trading JujuNew York Knicks: NBA SO/UP Bets and Analysis: Pacers-Knicks, Kings-Lakers https://t.co/gxloUyjQAs@nyknicks Stay within a certain limit and not take emergency shots off the dribble at the top of the key at the beginning of the clock. Do those at 12 ... 6 seconds left when ball movement has exhausted options.@nyknicks Welcome back Julius let’s play the right way and turn this ship around@Et3tg @mahrezfort @ToddyWoddy1330 @m4mba824 @nyknicks What game are you watching? The Knicks run 1-5 PNR 90% of the game. Obi is standing in the corner. Obi is not an iso player like Randle and that’s who the playbook is built around.@nyknicks Julius is a talented player and as a fan, I'm one of the few minorities who will not dismiss what he did last year. He can shoot, post, rebound, create his own shot, but as a big man, more of the traditional type, he would succeed more if he stayed within a certain limit.@KnicksGolfChill @ToddyWoddy1330 @nyknicks Ben Simmons? Do you know how much it would take to get him here? You have to give up the farm to something that is like a guy like Simmons who hasn’t played in 6 months and has emotion issues@nyknicks Bro got stopped many times.#NBA Current Odds

Please win tonight @nyknicks@nyknicks New school or old school. Both Julius and Fournier should be running down court to get high percentage shots and a ball-handler should be ..... handling the ball.@nyknicks 3 dudes on him 😂@nyknicks fumbled this so bad 🤦‍♂️ #newyorkforever https://t.co/dN48aciBlf@nyknicks #NYKnicks, please play that back. REWIND.@mahrezfort @ToddyWoddy1330 @KnicksGolfChill @nyknicks We lost against Toronto because they were healthy and we weren’t we literally played knox at center. The first game against OKC was luck in fact we were only down by 3 in the 4th. They made 18 3s yet only scored 95. Most of their guys are shooting below 30% on the season as well@KnicksGolfChill @ToddyWoddy1330 @nyknicks Yeah I have, before that Julius didn’t play well not suing he did but the whole team didn’t help him as well as the coaching staff@nyknicks time, with still a few seconds left, Julius dribbled the ball as the PG, on the left side near the paint trying to shake off defender - lost control. End of half. Leaving the court Fournier and Julius got into a heated verbal exchange. Everything about that was wrong.fuck it, take him @nyknicks https://t.co/8Es4J9YbbD@nyknicks team dynamics with new players added and old players leaving? It's probably both. What would you do if you were Julius? One game in particular that summed up the season so far was a home game, which as a fan I just burried in memory,  but the sequence stood out. Approaching half@eWinnerPL Memphis Grizzlies, New York Knicks, LA Lakers@4653Cheese @Free_Haiti6 Wilt Chamberlain set the single-game scoring record in the National Basketball Association by scoring 100 points for the Philadelphia Warriors in a 169–147 win over the New York Knicks on March 2, 1962, at Hershey Sports Arena in Hershey, Pennsylvania.

Clearly, the team's focal point of the offense last year, Julius, hasn't been the same.

New roles take time to get used to. ex: Burks struggled w/his shot as starting PG.

Continuity is the most underappreciated aspect  of a winning team in any sport.@mahrezfort @ToddyWoddy1330 @Et3tg @m4mba824 @nyknicks So you’re basing your analysis of Obi on 2 games with a depleted roster and no plays run for him? Got it… no he’s not ball dominant like Jules but he can put up those stats if he gets touches. Which he has not the 1st 2 games. Blame coaching for that..Unstoppable force.

We had no shot creators that can score on all three levels, how about you root for the team to succeed as a whole instead to fit your side? 💀@TenDeep_ @babynewt1992 @nyknicks very easy taking into account Camby and Ewing were out and Kurt Thomas was never known as a top shot blocker🏀 Two teams mired in disappointing seasons face off in New York tonight.

Vastly improved his rebounding last season. We got old as dirt Carmelo Anthony at the 4-spot. This is not the Denver Nuggets version or New York Knicks version of Carmelo Anthony.Magic Johnson was traded by the Lakers to New York Knicks.

A friend still hasn't forgiven me for calling him on his phone during a half court shot in Madison Square Garden @NYKnicks Game while I was watching him from courtside.  #AIRBALL@RealSkipBayless Lol Nets loses 3 in a row,,New York is forever Knicks town! Bing bong lol@nyknicks NY Knicks are probably the biggest joke in sports besides the NYG and NYJ.  Why do u think? Think about ownership and the crap coaches and staff we get.  The Knicks bring in more profit then almost every team. Dolan obviously prefers easy money over actually winning@nyknicks NY Knicks organization always gets has been players and they draft good players it’s just the organization isn’t ran properly.  Players come and always fail.  Imagine a good draft pick we picked up on a good organizations roster.  I think they grow and have good careersThe big question on everybody's minds is, does Brad Newley feature in the Melbourne United team or the New York Knicks? https://t.co/adNNoG0A4b@nyknicks I have figured out why we always stink. It is not the players.  We have had some pretty good players come thru this organization and always tend to have there worst part of there career. It’s not them it’s the organization.

Would love to have @nyknicks #KnicksNation #BingBong to join in!!!@SNYtv There’s none! Mets? Yankees? Knicks? Giants? Jets? Terrible to be a New York fan, I guess the Giants and Jets will both get an early draft selection! Maybe draft another first round quarterback who will flop! Best moment has to be the end of another miserable season for  N.Y.@steve_balazsi @TeamDreamville @nyknicks It’s a t-shirt SteveBrad Newley’s 2007 draft rights have been traded from the Lakers to the Knicks, but don’t expect the 36-year-old to be suiting up for New York anytime soon… 😆

What was said was "The bench plays better than the starters" go back and watch how many times the Randle lead starters were down double digits after the first quarter. The Bench which was Rose, Quick, Obi, Burks, Mitch.  The kids will learn to play together.Conflicts with the anniversary of me being drafted by @nyknicks, which also really happened. https://t.co/UYlsaAaarz@My_business_man @nyknicks Fact@nyknicks Get a new coachNew York Knicks: Knicks waive swingman shortly after trading for him https://t.co/hPCt4RAsSuI’m talking about spare time in New York I buy floor seats to watch the Knicks, Ion even know no players😂😂@hhpthebook @nyknicks I could be wrong but one of the reasons we are hype about the kids is that they played good together.@nyknicks it’s 2022 and y’all still embarrassing me every time I bet on a game@PickandRollAU @BradNewley @MelbUnited @nyknicks @NBA Yeah but they won't use him.@arturasfanclub @nyknicks The Knicks wow 😯So, @nyknicks lost another game yesterday...in land of maple syrup &amp; ice hockey...in mostly empty arena!
