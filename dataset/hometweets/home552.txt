And has absolutely nothing to with Randle? üíÄ@nyknicks 40 minutes from Thibs@nyknicks Randle and Fournier should be textbook post-up and spot-up respectively. Barret should be the slasher.

Obi is not an iso player like Randle and that‚Äôs who the playbook is built around.@nyknicks Julius is a talented player and as a fan, I'm one of the few minorities who will not dismiss what he did last year. He can shoot, post, rebound, create his own shot, but as a big man, more of the traditional type, he would succeed more if he stayed within a certain limit.@KnicksGolfChill @ToddyWoddy1330 @nyknicks Ben Simmons?

The first game against OKC was luck in fact we were only down by 3 in the 4th. They made 18 3s yet only scored 95. Most of their guys are shooting below 30% on the season as well@KnicksGolfChill @ToddyWoddy1330 @nyknicks Yeah I have, before that Julius didn‚Äôt play well not suing he did but the whole team didn‚Äôt help him as well as the coaching staff@nyknicks time, with still a few seconds left, Julius dribbled the ball as the PG, on the left side near the paint trying to shake off defender - lost control. End of half. Leaving the court Fournier and Julius got into a heated verbal exchange. Everything about that was wrong.fuck it, take him @nyknicks https://t.co/8Es4J9YbbD@nyknicks team dynamics with new players added and old players leaving? It's probably both.

Continuity is the most underappreciated aspect  of a winning team in any sport.@mahrezfort @ToddyWoddy1330 @Et3tg @m4mba824 @nyknicks So you‚Äôre basing your analysis of Obi on 2 games with a depleted roster and no plays run for him?

Bing bong lol@nyknicks NY Knicks are probably the biggest joke in sports besides the NYG and NYJ.  Why do u think? Think about ownership and the crap coaches and staff we get.  The Knicks bring in more profit then almost every team. Dolan obviously prefers easy money over actually winning@nyknicks NY Knicks organization always gets has been players and they draft good players it‚Äôs just the organization isn‚Äôt ran properly.  Players come and always fail.  Imagine a good draft pick we picked up on a good organizations roster.  I think they grow and have good careersThe big question on everybody's minds is, does Brad Newley feature in the Melbourne United team or the New York Knicks? https://t.co/adNNoG0A4b@nyknicks I have figured out why we always stink. It is not the players.  We have had some pretty good players come thru this organization and always tend to have there worst part of there career. It‚Äôs not them it‚Äôs the organization.
