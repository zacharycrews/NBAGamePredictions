Had the best record in the NBA, but ran out of gas in the eastern finals against newly put together Miami Heat. Thibs didn’t have an answer after game 1’s adjustment on Drose. Each one of them games were decided by 10 or less outside of game 1. https://t.co/8fXr4v3gfD@MiamiHEAT Not a single mention of La Carreta. I’m rooting for a different team from now on.According to Keith Pompey, Philadelphia’s star guard James Harden will not be available tonight when the team play the Miami Heat due to a hamstring treatment plan. A lot of people are saying Milton may get more minutes and I agree, he played well last night. #sixers67 https://t.co/WauOsv4fkT@HeeatFan1 @tembo_slice @MiamiHEAT @sixers Damn bruh not even gonna cap all I was thinking about was fight night but the night just got a little more interesting 👀😈😈 #DemonTime @sixers@HeeatFan1 @Donny_BIGGS @MiamiHEAT @sixers Harden’s resting though /:Would you bet 10k that the Miami Heat will not miss the playoffs at all over the next 10 seasons?@MiamiHEAT Duncan with the best restaurant🔥@Bam_Adobobayo @MiamiHEAT Man coach could care less where he goes to eat 😂I’ll share this one for all the Twitter homies.

It makes sense to be cautious especially on the second half of a back-to-back, and it looks like Miami will be without a ton of their top players.#Sixers guard James Harden has been ruled out for Saturday's game against the Miami Heat due to scheduled management of left hamstring injury, @PompeyOnSixers .

No need to be alarm as this was a schedule Maintenance/Rest Day for Harden’s Hamstring. 

As much as I want to see James Harden play, health should be the priority for this team.🇺🇸 No James Harden tonight for the Sixers vs Heat: injury management, he’s still not playing back to backs

Jimmy, Bam, Dedmon and others were out, we have short memories.@NBA @RexChapman @BetMGM My money is on the @MiamiHEAT Best point guard best center and bench in the league.Your mouth is why you're not winning Championships and let alone not winning Games. You should've stayed humble last year and you would not be in this situation. I know a Miami Heat Fan that tells me y'all are not on the Miami Heat Level.

Just having a nice intelligent talk with a touch of humor@Rjeff24 best backup center is @d_dedmon3 @MiamiHEAT@Heats_ter @MiamiHEAT @miaheatbeat @HeatNationCom @Zachppp Its because he is slow on rotations and im basing it on more than just 5mins, everytime i watch him play just get frustrated seeing him slow to a spot often. Trust there is a reason spo didnt plug him back in he sees it too obviouslyI need to find me a Miami Heat shawty where you at 👀 #HEATCulture #LetsGoHEAT #HEATBae lmao@MiamiHeatTheory He becomes a Miami Heat from now forward...this is our f**king yearLeBron staying in Miami is one of the biggest “what if?”s in basketball history (my opinion). I firmly believe that from 2015-2022, the Heat would’ve won at least 3 more. https://t.co/g0nd1NF41jMiami Heat ✅

The finals in 2010 the lakers won because Bynum broke Perkins leg in game 6, but you casually wooooEveryone freaked out when LeBron James joined the Miami Heat, and Kevin Durant joined the Golden State Warriors. But .... neither team won 3 championships in a row. Shows you how specia7... #mobilsocial https://t.co/8i1YFk3NQ3@Nba_MasDeb8tr @MiamiHEAT @miaheatbeat @HeatNationCom @Zachppp at the start of the game, they were scoring on everyone, not just Yurt. In 5 minutes he scored 2 points and had 3 rebounds more that anyone at that point. I don't see how you can evaluate in 5 minutes but that's just me.This me if Miami Heat need a late game stop in the playoffs https://t.co/7V0XAhy06aI can't watch Chicago missing pieces, the Bucks, the surely soon resurgent Nets, the revitalized 76ers, and the newly hard nosed Celtics and believe that the Miami Heat are coming out of the east. I don't think they make the conference final.lakers fans forget we beat Miami in the bubble because Howard game Bam whiplash and he was out for 2 games....rmember...those days are gone I guess, where we play with heart and heat.@MiamiHEAT If Spo don’t win COTY and Tyler don’t win 6MOTY Ima riot.Y’all picked precious right before maxey @MiamiHEAT i need a ring to make up for that 😂 https://t.co/orqYxCmZxe@JoshReynolds24 If they manage to beat a rested Heat team on a back to back in Miami… https://t.co/5XR3nBUzn1@IraHeatBeat Hope sixers don't fall for Miami psychological game Heat will be ready to play playoff basketball against sixers .They are home n want to make a statement@MiamiHEAT Welcomes to the Coty family.
