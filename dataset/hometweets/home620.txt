And they’re not even that good to watch this season.@BrooklynNets Clax have been great but the switch defense and physicality was a lot better with Sharpe, it was less mismatches near the rim. Clax need to learn when to switch and when not to, you can’t be leaving smaller guys defending bigger guys near the rim. Coaches need to coach him up.@statmuse @Patty_Mills @BrooklynNets Replacing joe harris@RealJayWilliams Jay I don't think it's a good PR move for Nets as a franchise trying to build something in Brooklyn. Also as you said on first take it's not a good move for Joe Tsai's personal image. I'm not saying it's right or wrong. Simply saying a bad PR move.@ChewyCenter @Bullskickass I agree losing to a contender like the Brooklyn Nets is a lot different than losing to a team like the pistons or magic.

Lets Go @BrooklynNets@Real2KInsider @RealJayWilliams @BrooklynNets Yeah but many ppl are against vaccine mandates... its not right to force ppl to get vaxed.  That's why Kyrie been protesting the mandate.  So in that sense the example isn't bad but good in the eyes of many.  Us as a people should have freedom of choice.The Brooklyn Nets destroyed the Bulls and showed the world that there is levels to this. When the Nets are fully healthy it is very clear that they are unmatched.

The bulls don’t have enough to compete with MKE and Brooklyn and that’s okay https://t.co/BeNKCXheS2@Real2KInsider @RealJayWilliams @BrooklynNets Lol Dems break rules and laws every day if they feel it’s justified… this is a dumb rule and makes no sense and does no good as vaccinated people spread the virus just as much or more than unvaccinated… stupid rule..Scary Hours 🔥 @BrooklynNets@RealJayWilliams @BrooklynNets I hear you on that. I respect AND support Kyrie on protesting against the vax mandate. But I think if Kyrie REALLY wants to show ppl that he's serious about his protest, he should pay the fines himself. He could afford it.

Thats what makes him dangerous@BrooklynNets The beard❤️If the @BrooklynNets decide to pay a fine to allow @KyrieIrving play at home, the state should close down the arena.  What’s the point of having rules if the rich get to break them because they have enough money to pay the fines repeatedly? @NBA #RulesAreMadeToBeBroken?@BrooklynNets Love Claxton but the switch defense and physicality was a lot better SharpeUtah Jazz 91 (Jordan Clarkson 22 pts) Cleveland Cavaliers 111 (Evan Mobley 15 pts, 10 rebs), Chicago Bulls 112 (Zach LaVine 22 pts) Brooklyn Nets 138 (James Harden 25 pts, 16 asists), Sacramento Kings 125 (De'Aaron Fox 29 pts) Los Angeles Lakers 116 (Lebron James 34 pts)Got absolutely destroyed by Nets, pathetic performance by the Bulls. 2-1 vs Brooklyn they got theres I respect it. See you in ECF, im pissedWhat an impressive win by the Nets last night!! Statement win!! @BrooklynNetsNets  (-9.5) host the Thunder on Thursday night. 

Brooklyn is 1-4-1 ATS this season on the second half of a back-to-back.

They showed today they can turn up in the defensive end. 

Core 3 did damage

That third quarter was ugly @chicagobulls Smh

But I promise y’all we better than that..

#BullsNation@HoodieMooney @NBA @BrooklynNets @JHarden13 1-0 with the big 3.@NBCSBulls The Brooklyn Nets only won tonight because the @chicagobulls had a game the night before. Their are no back to back games in the playoffs, remember. I'm not even worried. #BullsNation@BrooklynNets  for this year title 🏆 @JHarden13 for the ring 🙏🏾  @KyrieIrving @KDTrey5  @NBA @espn @basket_mouth@jeyswannn @NBA @BrooklynNets Stop it, I’m not telling someone how to do their jobs, I’m just telling them how to apply my knowledge of basketball. Athletes are selective with their knowledge sharing, execution is another topic but go off king.I watch A LOT of NBA basketball, and as somebody who hates the @BrooklynNets I'm pretty sure Patty (not sure why he uses T's instead of D's) Mills is the best "insta offense" player in the league.  Taking over Jordan Clarkson's spot.@stillgottaChi @jungwoobaddie Nets definitely needed that one more than the Bulls.

Then again, Brooklyn is 11–10 at home and 15–4 on the road—and that’s *before* Kyrie—so it’s unclear what we’re really playing for at the moment. We’re at the Steve Nash Nutty Roster Experiments part of the regular season.James Harden after tonight’s @BrooklynNets rout of the Bulls - “once we get Kyrie to play home games we are going to ….

That shit would be like playing against an all star team@Reese_eeee Hahaha please don't...should I accept the Brooklyn Nets or Phoenix Suns as NBA Champs? 😂🤣🤣I hope tonight shows this @BrooklynNets team that if there is consistent effort, ball movement, and energy in the first three quarters, the stars don’t need to play big minutes in the fourth – even against teams over .500.The top two teams in the East, Chicago Bulls &amp; Brooklyn Nets went head-to-head tonight, with the Nets blowing them out by 26, 138-112! 

Brooklyn led by as much as FORTY in the game! 😳

Harden: 25 PTS, 16 AST, 7 REB
Durant: 27 PTS, 9 AST, 7/10
Kyrie: 9 PTS, 4/10

SHEESH 👀 https://t.co/16Nv5LrLB9The Brooklyn Nets are now an incredible 15-4 in away games this season.

They score a blowout victory over Eastern Conference leaders Chicago.

Pay that Small fine.RT YESNetwork "RT @BrooklynNets: Shaping up to be a fun one https://t.co/muTgZ21Y1u"@BrooklynNets @JHarden13 As a diehard Stephen Curry fan… i have come to the conclusion. James Harden is better than my favorite player 😔 😞💔 

Scoring - Harden

Shooting - Curry(its very close)

Playmaking - Harden

Defense - Harden

Beard - Harden

Blowing 3-1 Leads - Curry

I am devastated 😞😪.@NBA @BrooklynNets Three👌@BrooklynNets @JHarden13 This is the Harden I like to see. Not the other bum role player 😅Never gets old. @JHarden13

Chicago tied it a few minutes ago, crashing the offensive glass to get a lot of possession. Nets are surely missing Claxton/Aldridge. Brooklyn responded with a run though.Kessler Edwards giving solid minutes for Brooklyn. Impressed by his versatility defensively.
