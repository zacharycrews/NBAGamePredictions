I do think he's going to be our number one option and excel at it much sooner than people think. But right now he's in a great position to learn and grow without all the pressure of being the leader.

#DETvsMIL | #FearTheDeer https://t.co/0mv4q1zHQj@brelanddconan @Bucks I agree wholeheartedly ... I love KAT but the dude is not fit to lead. His demeanor is way too sporadic, he gets too emotional and cant seem to stay focused... I want them to start running the offense through Anthony Edwards instead of forcing the big man offense thru KAT.@anisi6996 @statmuse @Bucks @Giannis_An34 Cant say Giannis cant play small ball Dude he is the best player for small ball 1-5@AndrewVgx @Bucks Need better leadership on that team, overall there not that bad. They have a chance to make it to the playoffs@brelanddconan @Bucks Lol, exactly... when we beat Denver a few years ago for the 8th seed, it was epic even though we all kind of knew we weren't getting past the Rockets in round 1.
Right now we're soaring on this 4 game win streak, sitting at 8-9... idk, maybe this is our year! 😁Happy birthday to Oscar Robertson the triple double machine #oscarrobertson #nbaallstar #tripledouble #tripledoublemachine #milwaukeebucks #cincinnatiroyals #oscarpalmerrobertson https://t.co/cVgILfdnEC🏀🏀NBA Games!
