We going to do it again tonight.@chicagobulls @DeMar_DeRozan That's Right ✅ Brother! DeMar DeRozan! 🎯💯👍🏀@nbatakeslal @Alexnasser_Sosa @chicagobulls @NikolaVucevic Because he shoots a lot of threes. I’m willing to bet a fair amount of his shots are 3’s. He’s shooting the same FG% from deep as his overall FG%. And he isn’t a high volume shooter. That’s for guys like LaVine, Derozan, Vooch, Harden, Durant, Curry, etc. Ball isn’t even closeNo @Money23Green or @KlayThompson tonight for @warriors. @chicagobulls need to come out and make a statement. Especially after that ass beating Chicago took on Wednesday from @BrooklynNets. #BullsNation #SeeRed #DubNation #NBA #NBATwitter@chicagobulls @GarrettPopcorn Southern Shore of Lake Superior!Chicago Bulls Drose.

You think 7 shots is a lot?  Also, they are a great ball movement team. What are you extrapolating from watching one game on prime time?  This team moves the ball around often, but they also call a lot of iso plays because of 8/11.

#nba #chicago #chicagobulls #NBAAllStar #DeMarDeRozan #smallstreamer #TMCGaming https://t.co/iArW8HUVox@EdubEsq Because I think he has shared the load in Chicago. Not even the clear Bulls’ MVP. He has averaged barely more points, rebounds and assists than LaVine but LaVine has been a far more efficient shooter. It’s been a team effort in Chicago, not one guys. Lonzo has been very good too.Can’t wait for us to beat my favorite player ass tonight. @chicagobulls @StephenCurry30Bull riders, Martin Luther King Jr. celebrations, craft cocktails and a musical parody usher in the weekend.

But I’ve been burned in the recent past lol@MVisuaIs @chicagobulls @espn @NBCSChicago @670TheScore Zach and demar just aren’t selfish players. Idk how many other nba teams you watch but this is pretty common for a teams best two players. Zach took 13 shots. He took like three shoots in the second half@RJHINDM @chicagobulls @espn @NBCSChicago @670TheScore Klay is not playing and Draymond has been out too.@walkertkl @chicagobulls @ZachLaVine Zach for MVP!!Chicago Bulls (-3.5) 🔒 vs GS Warriors

GS is without Draymond, Klay, and GP2 which severely hurts both ends of the court. Steph averaging 21.2 ppg in January. I don’t see GS slowing down a healthy DeRozan, LaVine, and Vucevic who are 11-5 ATS as home favorites.

Illinois will enact a statewide vaccine mandate after seeing the @chicagobulls lose 138-112 to the Nets w/Kylie Irving. 

@RustyBUCKETS321At this point if you play for any Illinois teams the Bulls will sign you smh. They passing these 10 day contract players around like blunts. FOH @chicagobulls https://t.co/IhStWS9O3u@jimfannin @chicagobulls Agree about Steph 100%

They certainly miss Draymond but the effort wasn't there against the #Bucks in the first half.

Those 6 years were the only times they ever made it into the Finals.Yeah. Maguire et al. What Cr7 has to do is inspire his teammates to step up their game. This is what Michael Jordan did in his last season with the Chicago Bulls (97/98). MJ's greatest achievement was not winning or being MVP but raising the game of his teammates (his words). https://t.co/KtM3mUyOpyP.J.

But I suppose Golden State could be thinking the same thing about Chicago.We can quibble about who means more to his respective team, Draymond Green to Golden State or Alex Caruso to Chicago.

But the first 29 minutes (and counting) of tonight’s game should be no more of a referendum on the Warriors as last night’s was on the Bulls.@JJROYSTOLEN @TGod222788 @eastsidezo_ @chicagobulls @HorizonNews That was mad corny@Jae_Franco @MoucheDj @chicagobulls I thought Pat was out for the year.
