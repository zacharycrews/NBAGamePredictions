He‚Äôs shooting the same FG% from deep as his overall FG%. And he isn‚Äôt a high volume shooter. That‚Äôs for guys like LaVine, Derozan, Vooch, Harden, Durant, Curry, etc. Ball isn‚Äôt even closeNo @Money23Green or @KlayThompson tonight for @warriors. @chicagobulls need to come out and make a statement.

He has averaged barely more points, rebounds and assists than LaVine but LaVine has been a far more efficient shooter. It‚Äôs been a team effort in Chicago, not one guys. Lonzo has been very good too.Can‚Äôt wait for us to beat my favorite player ass tonight. @chicagobulls @StephenCurry30Bull riders, Martin Luther King Jr. celebrations, craft cocktails and a musical parody usher in the weekend.

GS is without Draymond, Klay, and GP2 which severely hurts both ends of the court. Steph averaging 21.2 ppg in January. I don‚Äôt see GS slowing down a healthy DeRozan, LaVine, and Vucevic who are 11-5 ATS as home favorites.

Those 6 years were the only times they ever made it into the Finals.Yeah. Maguire et al. What Cr7 has to do is inspire his teammates to step up their game. This is what Michael Jordan did in his last season with the Chicago Bulls (97/98). MJ's greatest achievement was not winning or being MVP but raising the game of his teammates (his words). https://t.co/KtM3mUyOpyP.J.
