But even if a team is able to dethrone the defending champion Nets, is there really anyone in the East who has a chance in a 7 game series against the Denver Nuggets?@ToruYanoFanAcct @Jaguars There's some awkwardness with this one...remember Vince had some problems with Kronoke when he owned the Denver Nuggets and not being able to schedule a Monday Night RAW because of playoff conflictsFat Lever 2020-21 Obsidian Aurora Purple Etch Auto /75

Also, the Raw that resulted in Mr. Kennedy getting released.We can only hope his focuses shift to arsenal not Denver nuggets https://t.co/NZg74cf1nh@ArmzWest Bro it ain’t just arsenal. It every team in the Kronke sports group. Denver nuggets got the league MVP and MVL contender again this year Etc. Too much money in the NFL he doesn’t take anything else seriously.@SkySportsPL Random thought, maybe start doing something like the city group and name his teams after Arsenal 

Arsenal LA Rams

He screwed over St Louis moving the Rams but increased the value by billions so was actually smart hahaWe also called 

West Ham
Nantes 
Colorado Avalanche 
Colorado Rams Basketball 
Derby County 
Denver Nuggets 
Eastern Washington 

All using Rams synchronicity these past few days 

(Many of those teams are owned by Rams Owners. STAN KROENKE)@MartinLuvsHouse Kobe Bryant died and league was not gonna let the Denver Nuggets win it all.. Come on maneee.Kroenke owns Denver Nuggets as well??Someone tell big Stan Kroenke, the Rams got their super bowl &amp; it’s time to focus on what’s important at Arsenal cos Denver Nuggets not winning a chip anytime soon.The only thing Stan Kroenke needs to do now is bring a championship to Denver. @nuggets #GetItDone #SpendTheMoneyStan Kroenke could own sports in 2022.
Los Angeles Rams - Super Bowl Champs.
Colorado Avalanche - Stanley Cup Champions?
Denver Nuggets - NBA Champions?The rams owner also owns the Denver nuggets. Decent pair of teams haha@jamesdmorris Sure. Now he can invest in the Denver NuggetsAnyone think the Kronkies can afford to let us watch the #denverNuggets games now throughout Colorado?@henrystxne Naa his second project is the Denver NuggetsThe Kronke’s have a NFL Championship now. So hopefully they bring that same energy to the Denver Nuggets and build a practice facility.@ZoldyckSignor @artetasexual He owns the Denver Nuggets and the Rams, Arsenal is like the Sakura of his team 7@ftblmiguel He owns the Denver Nuggets too. Arsenal is the only team in his portfolio that isn’t progressing.You just know Kreonke will look at the Denver Nuggets next before Arsenal 🤧🤣Fuck the Kroenkes. Signed; Denver Nuggets fans.@prettiedove I don’t like the Rams exactly because it is owned by the Kroenkes. He only cares about the @RamsNFL and he sees @Arsenal as a business. Hence, I root against Rams, Denver Nuggets and Colorado Rapids.
