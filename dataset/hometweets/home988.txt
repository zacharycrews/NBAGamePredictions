The final 2 quarters in Sacramento plus the first 2 in Dallas tonight: #Knicks outscored #Kings/#Mavs 144-86. They shot 59.5% from the field and 46.3% from ThreeMinutes for Neemy please 🙏
@SacramentoKingswhat were the kings doing with bagley in Sacramento@KnicksKnest @AltMobile1 @SacramentoKings I am speaking as a third party here.  Your thinking that it is okay for your guy to do it, but not others, is flawed at best.  Try to see past your personal bias and be more objective in your reasoning—otherwise, you aren’t bringing any value to the conversation.Worst run franchises in every sport

Even if it is with MUCH less force and more deflecting than anything. CP3 looked like he was trying to deflect the official more than anything.@ItWasAKindness @Darko251989 @SacramentoKings CP3 did extend his arm though. By definition that's a push. The ref 100% backed into him. But he did extend his arm. It doesn't matter in the grand scheme of things because he plays for a team that wins so the league allows them luxuries like making contact with officials.@spaghetti916 @Darko251989 @SacramentoKings NBA has a big problem with its officiating system and Sabonis should not be suspended.

That said, no need to make things up. CP3 pushed nobody and the braindead ref backed up into him.@SacramentoKings New view from my first game as a full season ticket holder in 2011...when they were supposed to leave town...

NBA slightly better because they don’t have Angel Hernandez.  Seriously, no one likes either of you, so that’s a little comforting.Sabonis was probably more angry at being on the @SacramentoKings than he was at the ref.

Time for some shed light@SacramentoKings Love Domas, but it was a fair punishmentJust watched the play where Sabonis was ejected and ultimately suspended over. What a horrible call, both on the phantom foul and the suspension. The NBA is unwatchable now, and I say this as a lifetime fan. Basketball fans, especially @SacramentoKings fans deserve better.@MarkJonesESPN @SacramentoKings Kings should be moved to Seattle or flat out dissolved.

Got suckered again. #refundme@TheFoxAndOx @Darko251989 @SacramentoKings That's what I'm saying. Like the league picks and chooses the situations when they enforce rules. Big markets can do anything. Small markets like Sac get the full wrath of the league. 
The lack of consistency is embarrassing and disgraceful.This is why “tanking” has always been a red herring. It is better to have a young, overmatched team playing hard and figuring stuff out, or, like, the Sacramento Kings doing whatever it is they’ve been doing for the past decade. https://t.co/TJ6xoVfKKi@James_HamNBA I love Holmes but it appears that he has quit the Kings and the city of Sacramento.@SacramentoKings Ratio🔑facts:

According to the @NBA and @NBAPR , this should not even be a technical foul.The Kings will be without Domantas Sabonis (one-game suspension) tonight when they face the Nuggets.

Nikola Jokic has averaged 25.3 points, 10.7 rebounds, and 9.0 assists in three games vs Sacramento this season.

No Sabonis or Holmes (personal) for the Kings tonight.@SacramentoKings @swipathefox we have a losing record 🔥🔥Sacramento Kings center Domantas Sabonis has been suspended one game without pay for aggressively confronting and making contact with a game official #SacramentoProud #nba75 #porvida@SacramentoKings 18 years since yalls last playoff appearance@SacramentoKings is this the first time he’s gone 13 games with 20+?NBA Player Prop:
Domantas Sabonis Over 17.5 R + A -120 (Sacramento Kings)

Sabonis has 18+ combined 8/L10 and usually exceeds Ast total vs Jokic. 

Fwiw I have Sabonis getting 7.8 Ast tonight (I will be sprinkling TD) https://t.co/hBsXT2IdoiThe Kings shooting since Sabonis has been with Sacramento (11 GP):

30.6 3PA/G (25th in NBA)
32.9% (27th in the NBA) https://t.co/tF6qOZVq80 https://t.co/iWFSrVgbMS@MiasDAD19 @SacramentoKings @GrantNapearshow Eric Collins better tho….@Golden1Center @SacramentoKings Thank you so much!@spanishgodish @SacramentoKings Doors open at 5:30pm for a 7pm Kings game.
