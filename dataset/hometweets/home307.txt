♥️ si tu suisThe Algo pick is the Under 220 in the Houston Rockets vs OKC tonight in the NBA. The Algo is predicting a total of around 206  so good value. The Algo also like Miami Heat over Denver However I didn’t take due to injuries on Miami and the line has plunged from -7 to -3.@HoustonRockets I’m ready for y’all to hire me.@CaipiraTips Phi 76ers -8

San Antonio Spurs -5
Dallas Mavericks -10
Utah Jazz -8
Los Angeles Clippers -5@SalmanAliNBA @RafaelStone12 @HoustonRockets KPJ better run pointNeither side is wrong in this #Rockets vs John Wall situation.

1) Buyout: He shouldn’t have to sacrifice millions to touch the court.

2) Bench: If opposed to the role, Houston isn’t obligated to start him when their goal is backcourt development.

3) Nobody wins when fam feud🚀#Rockets have lost 8 of their last 10 games when playing as favorites. Houston is the favorite given a 57.4% chance to beat #ThunderUp

My numbers for the Thunder line-up pretty well with Vegas, but I am nowhere near as high on the Rockets as the lines are. I have the under in this game, but almost entirely because of Houston so I like the under on their team total even more.#Basketball,

@OUHealth Game Day Report@Jverret23 @Rockets_Insider I think Lakers would take Wall right now over Westbrook lol. I get Wall ain't CP3 but . I thought Houston would take the OKC approach with Wall. Gotta play him to sell him.  But with Walls injury history I can see why they wanna put him on Ice. I see@InzaneDaMenace @HoustonRockets @creditkarma He was crushing it in the G League@DimeloWilton @JGrochett @ShamsCharania @TheAthletic @HoustonRockets @NBA Preach.

Any chance you can help? Appreciate you.@Jawz27 @Rockets_Insider They have some vets. Playing Wall just hinders KPJ. They couldn't trade Wall without giving up picks which they won't do which is why he is sitting now. I got you lol almost no one outside of Houston understands why Wall is sitting I don't think.1U Houston Rockets -2

Point guard James Harden was the #1 on the ball decision maker, not Westbrook. 1 huge difference = Houston traded 6’10 shot-blocker Capela to help Westbrook.

The Rockets are on pace to win 12 games this year, they did 50% better last year with Wall playing in a shortened season. He gets paid to improve their chances at being competitiveYou know what’s crazy ? In one of our least competitive years the Houston Rockets are one of the most talked about most hated teams…we are speed rebuilding at a rate that shouldn’t even be imaginable and people outside of rocket fans are finding a way to hate on everything we do@a_duckett This is correct. The #Rockets would trade John Wall if they could. But the teams interested in him are waiting for a buy-out because they view him as a bargain buy and not worth his market price.

so while it's good they won Detroit, i don't think that's gonna enough go even get to 2nd roundI wouldn't even wanna suit up for the Houston pocket rockets at this point. I get being competitive, and the 00000's on the end of the check, but we all know why he aint playing, hopefully they find a solution to this.

If the coaches want kpj to run point more he can do so, just because wall starts doesn’t mean he has to finish. They need to be transparent and considerate.

Very confident with this.@appyanks @cavs @HoustonRockets Wow! Needless to say, Jeff Appel is not in agreement.@RooshWilliams So easy to forget. Every thinks john wall wants to play for rockets. John wall wants to hoop period. He doesnt care if it is houston or another team. Stone wont trade him as no buyer that suits stone and wall wont want buyout to lose 40mil.  So who is greedy?OKC Thunder @ Houston Rockets

https://t.co/jRgQi89swPCall him up @HoustonRockets https://t.co/Mk6SgA4xt5I was proud I attended one of the final NBA games of Michael Jordan's career.

The most they’ve beat any team this year was by 10 with the Houston rockets which is the worst team in the nba.Still keep a rocket idc if I’m in Houston@HoustonRockets should fire their for GM for continuously sitting their star @john_wall while the team is continuously struggling and bleeding. What kind of strategy is this? WTF?? #BoycottRocketsGame https://t.co/kMMF5BapT7@TheNBACentral @AhnFireDigital K. Don’t take the 60+ million left on ur contract, negotiate a buy out, I’m sure the @HoustonRockets would do it for 10 mil, and boom! But you want ur money right? Can’t have both when ur contract and play don’t match bud.@HoustonRockets @Jaygup23 Should be part of #rockets 2nd unit with Al-P &amp; KJ Martin soon@JGrochett @ShamsCharania @TheAthletic @HoustonRockets @NBA The better question is why trade Russell Westbrook for Wall to begin with, instead of getting more pieces to help with the future? It’s bad enough Rockets choked with the Harden/Oladipo trade but made it worse by trading for an expensive guy, just so he can sit&amp;not play🤣They should always think what’s best for them. And to be honest, I’m not understanding how Houston doesn’t believe John Wall playing solid minutes is what’s best for the Rockets. https://t.co/eVAq1ugXRs@JohnWall @Schultz_Report Houston loves you John.
