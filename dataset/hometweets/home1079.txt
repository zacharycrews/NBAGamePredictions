Him pushing away @RjBarrett6 and slapping way @obitoppin1 when they were both trying to be good mates is uncalled for. #knicksHawks @ Knicks

NYK has won three in a row against ATL since the embarrassment of their playoff series. Knicks also take in good form having gone 7-2 ATS in their last 9. If they don't win this they can basically say goodbye to the season.

But I guess that don‚Äôt mean anything either huh?@mtyjfs8v64 @KnicksGiantsSZN @iambluuu_ @nyknicks I think anyone who says D will was better then Chris Paul need to have their head examined the same Chris Paul who‚Äôs like second all time in steals and assist? üòÇüòÇü•¥ü•¥ü•¥@mtyjfs8v64 @KnicksGiantsSZN @iambluuu_ @nyknicks Are you even joking with this bullshit?
