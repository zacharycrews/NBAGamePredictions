https://t.co/BIM0ZDaP0f https://t.co/ANhk9aYArq@terry_ruck I would think a new arena someday might be the plan. I was basing my statement on the practice facilities on what the Detroit Piston people said when Blake brought them to Norman a few years ago. They thought it was nicer than some NBA teams have for practice facilities.@DetroitPistons The white in the background is racist. If you disagree you are Hitler.@LeBronGoCrazyy @BleacherReport @JDumasReports @DetroitPistons @SacramentoKings @celtics @trailblazers THT is proving why he is a future star in the NBA. If I were the Blazers GM right now, I‚Äôd be looking to trade Dame for THT, straight up. THT is a potential All-Star. Dame is old. If anything the Lakers would be losing that trade. Should be a no-brainer for the Blazers.@statmuse It‚Äôs funny because when he did this in Detroit they said ‚Äúrebounds are meaningless the pistons suck‚Äù now he‚Äôs on a good team barely getting 20 minutes .

https://t.co/LcCBBkwPJ5TBH, Jalen Green has been underwhelming so far.

He deserves criticism right now for his incessant claim of "I should have been the No. 1 pick!". SMH.

Cade Cunningham is much much better than him rn.
