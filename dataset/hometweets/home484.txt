  #betting #Basketball #Cleveland #Cavaliers #Toronto #Raptors@Spartas_Finest @Sara_Tonyn @cavs I've always liked Sexton, thought I saw some change in his game and growth in what few games he did play before getting injured. But, he needs to accept whatever role the Cavs offer him at this point, even if it's a bench role. You're right, we can't mess with this chemistry.@MobleyTakeover @brndyalexander @cavs Wow how alpha tommy toughnuts.@cavs @Raptors @BallySportsCLE @betwayusa They have the roster to Challenge the East this season with the top defense #3 in the whole NBA. With four future potential All-Stars all on the same team that fits. This Cavs team plays like San Antonio with this motion offense that had a record 85 &amp; 69 points in a half.amazing zone buster from Cleveland Cavaliers: Horns Elbow Dive

the trick is the PG (Garland) pulling the top defender (KCP) away from the Elbow, so that all Mobley has to do is turn and play a 4-on-3 numbers game https://t.co/fN8OnXdJjq@cavs @Raptors @BallySportsCLE @betwayusa This Cavs team plays like San Antonio. Best defense and explosion offense. 
Don't make this trade for Simmons, I wanted before the season but not now.
The Cavs team's chemistry is too good/roster can Challenge this season in the East with the top defense in #3 in the NBA.Leggo @cavs@mr216reality @cavs Yea I saw Okoro is questionable so he seems to be out of protocols, in the conditioning phase. Was hoping Mobley could be back too.@mellow_nie91 @cavs Wondering the same?!?!
