Charlotte has lost six straight against the Lakers, the last win coming out in LA on Jan. 5, 2018 (108-94). Six players were in double figures in that one.@SamFarberLive @NBAAllStar @hornets @MilesBridges I am so glad for him and I truly hope he gets in!GP: Charlotte Hornets ML (warning: high juice play)A very interesting and notable item from the @NBAAllStar vote. 

Antetokounmpo, Durant and Embiid easily received the most votes from the players vote, but guess who was 4th among Eastern Conference front court players.

More NFTs might mean more chances when they do raffle based on NFTs (e.g. their gold evolve NFT raffle)@jbondwagon @hornets @MELOD1P @LaMeloverse @cherry_nft Can you have multiple entries if you have several LaMelo NFTs? Or one per wallet?▶️▶️▶️https://t.co/uzAKNQfm4E◀️◀️◀️

🆚 Charlotte Hornets (27-22)
🏟️ Spectrum Center
🕒 4:30 PM 🇺🇸 (Los Angeles) | 1:30 AM 🇪🇦 | 21:30 PM 🇦🇷

🚑 OUT: Kendrick Nunn. https://t.co/LaT2i4AqUoGood morning Brodie’s, it’s GAMEDAY against the Charlotte Hornets where we play our 2nd game of a back to back, tonight is a game we want to win and we still don’t know if AD OR BRON are playing! So let’s just go out there and ball! 

#LakeShow #WhyNot https://t.co/tbflWV4A2o@KevLAbeast @hornets @MELOD1P I’ve been wanting them to bring purple back full time for years. Purple sells, and they don’t have enough purple merchandise…. And to retire Vince Carter’s number.@NBA2K_MyTEAM @hornets Miles@tjl660 @hornets @MELOD1P If they took this exact design &amp; put it on the jacket above it would spark up nostalgia amongst fans who were around when Vince Carter won the slam dunk contest in 2000. Old School sells https://t.co/xDXe6pcOY3@hornets See you tonight!! 9 year old son bday celebration@KevLAbeast @hornets @MELOD1P @Raptors My friend had that exact starter jacket you posted above, the hornets one. I remember him always complaining how cold he was because they’re not built for our -30f to -40f winter days. I had a San Jose Sharks one. Teal was the colour.@tjl660 @hornets @MELOD1P That @Raptors starter jacket lacks creativity &amp; vision. For $250 vs what you get? Total garbage. Hornets example from above ⬆️ = Beauty@hornets good morning! They say the third time is the charm, but it’s not my third birthday, it’s my 26th, which is only 132 away from how many points we scored 2 days ago. That was crazy. Now how about those 4 tix for a birthday fella?@KevLAbeast @hornets @MELOD1P That Raptors jacket is uh, nice.@KevLAbeast @hornets @MELOD1P https://t.co/2LsJMYMx0R Well, the Raptors sell them up North. So does the CFL.@tjl660 @hornets @MELOD1P Final point. It is nice to see young fans at hornets games here in 2022 but I was once a young fan of the NBA in the 90’s &amp; b/c of how exciting the Hornets are to watch, I have a new found interest in the NBA. So catering to my demographic = huge potentialNBA basketball that'll leave you 😱

#Hornets@chrislldn You gotta understand Charlotte is not Miami, NY, Chicago or LA to have bigger markets. My Hornets did their best. Besides the back court players from the East that got voted as All Stars also deserve to be in there. Charlotte is the best place for Lamelo and he knows it@CLTdevelopment @hornets The first year the Hornets played there was a meet &amp; greet with all the players at a restaurant I was working. I have a Hornet’s t-shirt with all of their signatures. First year! Restaurant was Florenz on Albemarle Rd.

•Average price of $299 is highest for any Hornets home game (+367% above avg resale of $64)
•Get-in price for lower-level seat is $521; in upper level it's $164@2KCustomz @NBA2K_MyTEAM @hornets We know 2k wouldn't give out a free evo dark matter for someone like kobe (before anyone says Westbrook last year, Westbrook and Kobe are different and Westbrook came out in May,) but it would be amazing if they did@kobedenzel1 @2KCustomz @NBA2K_MyTEAM @hornets 2k don't do that. Not saying they are great or anything, but when 2 cards of the same in the same tier come out months after another they make the second card way better, (except 99s.) An example is the 2 galaxy opal ADs or the 2 pink diamond and 2 opal Giannis cards last year@GHandle1 @CelebsInCLT @MELOD1P @spectrumcenter @hornets Ounce is $60 out-the-door here at my dispensary in CO.

Listen Here: https://t.co/RIZ0TaCLKm@hornets @greensboroswarm Vernon Carey deserves more minutes with the hornets he has had some good games when they actually give him an opportunity.LeBron needs 82 more points that he's likely to get in 3 or 4 more games played. If he is also out vs. the @hornets tomorrow, the odds of him matching Kareem's all time points record on national TV go way up - either Feb. 3 @LAClippers or Feb 5 vs. @nyknicks. https://t.co/6P27XEFXwY@LuisDalvan @hornets Appreciate your kindness always, Luis!@eemchristensen @hornets BLESSS@jaredellis_96 @hornets Yesssirrrrrrrrrrr@HeatwaveDesigns @hornets Thank you so much!!@basiksense @hornets Yezzir, Raleigh born-and-raised!
