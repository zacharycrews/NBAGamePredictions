OG by far our best defender so this is more a GTJ conversation btw.

OG or cade right now is not close for the required role on TORIt’s been 1,070 days since the last playoff game by a Detroit sports team. (Pistons vs. Bucks on April 22, 2019.) Who is Detroit's best hope to MAKE THE PLAYOFFS next?

Scottie or Mobley wouldnt do better than what cade is doing with Detroit.

But wouldnt space as much as the other 2, and wouldnt defend as well as the other 2.@GobeilNick @DET2335 @ChrisGman7 @DetroitKoolAid @NBA @WoodwardPistons @woodwardsports @seanhalfcourt @jeffiafrate @SpeakEZsports_ @Pistons__Talk @andrew_jonna @DetroitPistons @AshtonDaTrainer @CadeCunningham_ You think adding a guy with legit scoring gravity would hurt your spacing 💀😭. Cade is still good defensively. It’s not like it would kill your defense. Provides some help side rim protection, rebounding, great communicator, and is good in passing lanes.@donaldvmitch @DET2335 @ChrisGman7 @DetroitKoolAid @NBA @WoodwardPistons @woodwardsports @seanhalfcourt @jeffiafrate @SpeakEZsports_ @Pistons__Talk @andrew_jonna @DetroitPistons @AshtonDaTrainer @CadeCunningham_ Of course he'll be good.

Im saying he doesnt bump GTJ or OG, thats all@donaldvmitch @DET2335 @ChrisGman7 @DetroitKoolAid @NBA @WoodwardPistons @woodwardsports @seanhalfcourt @jeffiafrate @SpeakEZsports_ @Pistons__Talk @andrew_jonna @DetroitPistons @AshtonDaTrainer @CadeCunningham_ Thats whats Scottie is doing.

Hes putting up 4 assist per game with the same low usage.

This is a hot take.

But i think Scottie's passing is better than FVV or Siakam.

He just doesnt have the other tools (handles, shooting, driving) for it to be a top optionDetroit Bad Boys Sway😤🔥🔥🔥 @isiahthomas Palace Guards #puma @detroitpistons @ Little Caesars Arena https://t.co/MajkFmXWAI@DetroitPistons @DraftKings Stew’s had quite a few good slams here lately!!@GobeilNick @DET2335 @ChrisGman7 @DetroitKoolAid @NBA @WoodwardPistons @woodwardsports @seanhalfcourt @jeffiafrate @SpeakEZsports_ @Pistons__Talk @andrew_jonna @DetroitPistons @AshtonDaTrainer @CadeCunningham_ Well his game literally fits alongside anyone.@NBAspain @DetroitPistons @FearTheFro always!! https://t.co/0HBgZX64ge@GobeilNick @DET2335 @ChrisGman7 @DetroitKoolAid @NBA @WoodwardPistons @woodwardsports @seanhalfcourt @jeffiafrate @SpeakEZsports_ @Pistons__Talk @andrew_jonna @DetroitPistons @AshtonDaTrainer @CadeCunningham_ Cade’s a great off ball player, he can all play on the ball and create offense for others. Plus he’s also been a positive on defense. Adding another guy who can create next to Siakam and FVV would be insane.@donaldvmitch @DET2335 @ChrisGman7 @DetroitKoolAid @NBA @WoodwardPistons @woodwardsports @seanhalfcourt @jeffiafrate @SpeakEZsports_ @Pistons__Talk @andrew_jonna @DetroitPistons @AshtonDaTrainer @CadeCunningham_ Its FVV and Siakams team.

The other 3 are their to compliment them.

Cade would adapt to that. And not the other way around@DetroitPistons Great Drawings!!

0 spacing. And you want to take one of them out lol.

You mean OG our best defender and GTJ top 5 in steals and 18 ppg and our best floor spacer.

No, not this year anyway.

He could start on a small lineup. But never in front of GTJ or OG stop it.@DetroitPistons My little girl drew me this picture of my favorite player. https://t.co/hSNePSSjE1@GobeilNick @DET2335 @ChrisGman7 @DetroitKoolAid @NBA @WoodwardPistons @woodwardsports @seanhalfcourt @jeffiafrate @SpeakEZsports_ @Pistons__Talk @andrew_jonna @DetroitPistons @AshtonDaTrainer @CadeCunningham_ Cade would be prioritized over GTJ and OG . The on ball creation is better and he creates more advantages for others. Team relies on him to create almost all the offense whether that’s on or off the ball. Cade’s role is much more difficult and he gets all defensive attention.#KNICKS#GETTING#GRITTY#IN#THE#MOTOR#CITY#NEW#YORK#KNICKS#VS#DETROIT#PISTONS https://t.co/RpWRd10cOq@ZeekeTheAfroGod @BayTracker @PortalCunn1ngh @DetroitPistons @LCArena_Detroit Anyone with an opinion different than their bullshit is “the Libs” 😂Doors are open for Kids Day at the crib 👋

B/c Scottie is the 3rd/4th option, he doesnt get those shots.

FVV and Siakam  arent passing Scottie the ball

Its going to the former, and to OG, and to GTJ.

And thats why Scottie has a high unassisted %. Because most of his plays are broken possession and Oreb@CaptainMarc95 @DETBadger @nsitto2 Scottie 0-3 vs pistons***

But rookie of the year and best rookie are not always the same thing.

Maybe thats where detroit fans get confused.

Like Brogdon over Embiid. Of course Embiid better lol.

And Cade a much more ball dominant player than the other two.

It depends what you mean by put up numbers.

Dont think Cade even Starts on toronto. If so its a very small lineup with Cade, OG, at the 3 4 5. Could maybe work@GobeilNick @DET2335 @ChrisGman7 @DetroitKoolAid @NBA @WoodwardPistons @woodwardsports @seanhalfcourt @jeffiafrate @SpeakEZsports_ @Pistons__Talk @andrew_jonna @DetroitPistons @AshtonDaTrainer @CadeCunningham_ Wait Cade has more % of assisted field goals next to worse creators. If he can play off of Cojo and Killian Hayes imagine him next to Siakam and FVV. He would be maximized.Consensus Line Move:

Yeah, Tayshaun was great, and goes with my later point that roles have a big impact.

But raising a shit team is easier than raising a good team

And personnally, i think Cade makes Det better than Scottie or Mobley would

But Cade wouldnt make Cle or TOR as better

Tough to evaluate diff roles.

Look at the homies lol. I'm in Detroit for a Pistons game. Sure I'll see ya soon buddy!I wanted to thank @DetroitPistons for choosing me as the giveaway winner for the 313 neon sign on #Pistons313day I took a selfie with it because I wanted to show everyone how big it is!

That's exactly what @DetroitPistons Assistant Athletic Trainer Bri Jefferson did to land her first job in the NBA.

Hear more about her inspiring journey tomorrow at 3 p.m. on the #Pistons pregame show. https://t.co/2k2yKoySoVWhy couldn’t this have happened when the @DetroitPistons were in town…#Raptors #wethenorth https://t.co/dPMv1Tg0pzI’m going to the @MiamiHEAT @DetroitPistons game tomorrow. By chance. You know. Right place. Right time. LFG! 🤘@DimeUPROXX @DetroitPistons Than they say he don’t got hopsSay you balling in Detroit boy you not piston@thewhitewhale43 @OdellBretthamJr Sounds like every “Score After 3rd Quarter” bettor who wagered against the 2003-2004 Detroit Pistons.Cade Cunningham is such a good passer. He's getting more and more comfortable creating or others off the bounce: 8.8 dimes in his last five.

Also: only 3 turnovers in the same span! That's good with the usage he has in Detroit. 
#Pistons https://t.co/nDKiHEGq0I@DearBabyScotty @CadeCunningham_ @DetroitPistons Have fun!March 26, 2007: Detroit #Pistons F Rasheed Wallace stole the inbounds pass from the Denver Nuggets with 1.5 seconds left before throwing up a half-court prayer and draining the OT-forcing buzzer-beater where DET won 113-109 in OT

Dude is a worse prospect than cole. Y’all got unlucky.@Nutri4Motion I wanted to know if you would be available to appear on the program for a phone interview on Wednesday March 30th at 1pm eastern time. We'll discuss how you got started in the sports nutrition field, your career in the NBA with the Detroit Pistons, Pistons playersI finally get to see the ROTY in person tomorrow!!! @CadeCunningham_ @DetroitPistons https://t.co/U9ic72TuKbJust stumbled upon this incredible image of Nelson Mandela wearing Pistons' gear during the Bad Boys' heyday. In 1990 Mandela went out of his way to visit Detroit to personally thank the city, Mayor Young, and the UAW for their stand against apartheid and support of the ANC. https://t.co/SR0yeSDdPA@EllieNotTifa @Nymphomachy That is what traditionalists would have you do, and plenty of folks do just that. I prefer to treat it like a "real" sport in which I want my favorites to win, regardless of moral character. Like my support of the "Bad Boys" era Detroit Pistons.@mjames4christ @statmuse @dennisrodman @DetroitPistons @Money23Green Thank youResultados NBA

Any shot attempt beyond the half court line with less than 5 secs on the clock in a quarter does not count as a missed attempt.@NBAHistory @DetroitPistons Ball don’t lieKristaps Porzingis had 30 points and 10 rebounds and the Washington Wizards held on to beat the Detroit Pistons 100-97 on Friday night.
 https://t.co/0nhWPPcR6dWizards Dub!!!!! Wizards beat the Detroit Pistons 100-97. Kristaps Porzingis: 30 pts, 10 reb, three 3pm. Deni Advija: 21 pts, ten reb, 4 ast. Rui Hachimura: 11, 5 reb. KCP: 8 pts, three reb, two ast. Corey Kispert and Thomas Bryant both had 7 pts. #DCAboveAll@IsiahThomas @DetroitPistons Ralph Sampson stayed in college, which made the #1 pick a little more questionable in 1981. At the time, you supposedly couldn't build an #NBA championship team around a little guy. The #Mavericks took Mark Aguirre and the rest is history!@Loud_Intrvrt 😂🤣😂 after my Detroit pistons dipped basketball died to me.@DimeUPROXX @DetroitPistons Big time. I never heard a color commentator say that. Loved it@AngryDetroiter @IsiahThomas @DetroitPistons My favorite of all time. Small but fucking mighty.@DetroitPistons @IsiahThomas @Cheurlin1788 congratulations command.@daveyinthecar @celticsfn3476 Detroit the 3rd team that came to mind after the Mavs &amp; Raptors. The Tatum-Dirk/Kawhi comps were the first thing I thought of, then those Pistons defense &amp; Rob/Ben (who I have compared before to LOUD opposition). Rip/Billups/Sheed trio don’t score as much as the Jays DUO tho.😳If I talk @DetroitPistons in trouble https://t.co/dW0dRAl8nqIt’s always special whenever ⁦@1MrBigShot⁩ comes home to Detroit. #Pistons https://t.co/8sM2DP09Bm@IsiahThomas @DetroitPistons We love you too Zeke ❤️I think we made the right pick lol
@DetroitPistons @CadeCunningham_ https://t.co/XF0RFEErh9@ReneusMeister Best NBA champ of all time: 2004 Detroit Pistons. When scoring 80 points needed effort.@DontFadeMe100 @DetroitPistons @MB3FIVE @CadeCunningham_ @Dreamville_33 @iam_killian He almost has a 2 to 1 assist to turnover ratio https://t.co/5OOuqFhGST@ODBSports @AndrewPCohn @AshtonDaTrainer @DetroitPistons Oh I remember…I went to some@Detroit_Stan14 @DetroitPistons @MB3FIVE @CadeCunningham_ @Dreamville_33 @iam_killian Don’t forget about all those Fken turn overs 😂 gets more TOs than assist. Inconsistent trash. I would be hella mad having him as one of my major draft picks.AO revealed in a interview that going to Detroit was the perfect situation. it just didn't work bc him and RIP play the guard position. and the Pistons was invested in Stuckey the chemistry wasn't right. plus he wanted to wear 3 but Stuckey had it Rodney wanted to give it to him@NBALatam @DetroitPistons I ThomasIt was dope asf to run into @MB3FIVE after he put up a monstrous game against the Wizards last night. I’m optimistic about his future with the pistons, and love watching him represent our city. Welcome to Detroit my man. Hope I didn’t ruin your date night by saying what up 😂
