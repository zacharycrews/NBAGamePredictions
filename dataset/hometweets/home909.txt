For the record, the teams I chose to stand behind at the start of this season were as follows:
@chicagobulls
@memgrizz
@hornets
It's always a conflict when they face each other. Buts also always a GOOD ASS GAME.The Nets play the Hornets in Charlotte (a few hours from me) on March 8th. 

Might be the Simmons debut, and KD and Kyrie should both play. 

I kind of HAVE to go, right?@hornets @CharlotteFC This needs to be an alternate.@hornets call up Kai!@downthedrive Is John Newman III related to former Charlotte Hornet Johnny Newman?@CharlotteFC @hornets I‚Äôm glad football is getting more recognition in AmericaQUESTION: how are we in north carolina 30 mins away from CHARLOTTE and there is no hornets shit in any store in mooresville? a joke.2022-02-27 @DetroitPistons at @Hornets
