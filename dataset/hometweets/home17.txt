For the Wizards, who steps up with Beal out? Dinwiddie will get a chance to really shine tonight. Pacers should win.WASHINGTON (AP) — Wizards guard Bradley Beal sat out the Washington Wizards' home opener Friday night against Indiana because of hip problems. https://t.co/lnN1Z419EsWashington Wizards Starters:

Spencer Dinwiddie
Aaron Holiday
Kentavious Caldwell-Pope
Kyle Kuzma
Daniel Gafford

Players out:
Anthony Gill
Bradley Beal
Thomas Bryant

Cassius Winston
#DCAboveAll #NBA #NBATwitter #NBA75Tonight's starting lineup for the Washington Wizards:
Dinwiddie, Holiday, Caldwell-Pope, Kuzma, Gafford
https://t.co/bVWH4Av1bs@RussCashes I’m thinking pacers -1.5 tonight because Bradley Beal is out. So easy dub by 2 for the pacers in Washington you’d think right? Especially after that hard fought first game in Charlotte. Can’t let the wizards go on a 24-0 run in the 3rd quarter though lolGet your game face on and get ready for the Wizards' home opener with our Pregame Live crew 😤

@sports_sell https://t.co/I01erdbozcY’all I need help.. my math wizards.. here is a math problem my God son needs help with. Please tell me how you got your answer. 

Based on the maps conversion factor (4.5 cm = 150 miles), how many cm is the
suspect from Washington D.C.? Round answer to hundredths https://t.co/E1JsIZTEIkThe Washington Wizards are undefeated 🔥💯@thejnollV2 First and for most, those are NY fans who know they aren’t going to win 60 games. Secondly, if Washington fans do that tomorrow after a win, can you imagine the Wizards and Capitals in the playoffs at the same time and both making long postseason runs. 😱#NBA (Temporada Regular) - Encerrados:
