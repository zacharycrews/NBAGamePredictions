I’ve watched several Hawks’ games in full and (Trae) just doesn’t have “IT”. For the record, I never said Trae wasn’t good, he just isn’t as good of a player as he thinks he is.@AlexSchaffers @ATLHawks @DWilkins21 @TheTraeYoung Same for your nephew! Seems to be a good night for firsts- with it being a Friday night and all the kids can stay up late. :-)@coldbeatle89 @ATLHawks @DWilkins21 @TheTraeYoung You too. I'm taking my nephew 1st @ATLHawks game tonight also. He has been wanting to go to a game since opening night. The only thing is he does know. I hope your son enjoy the game.I’ve been waiting on an Atlanta Hawks reporter to get the inside news over the national reports! Congratulations Sarah!

I think he doesn't drive more because by the time he gets the ball to make a play, it's late in the shot clock. He doesn't get much time to work as the wings do.@ATLHawks @DWilkins21 I watched live as a 14 year old.  Wanted to see Nique win after getting robbed in Chicago in 88.  I also assumed I wasn’t missing anything by not watching Tyson/Douglas that night.  I was wrong.@rayfordyoung @NBA @ATLHawks 🛑 Simmons being scared to shoot has nothing to do with your son, nice try tho ✌🏾@MikeBellATL @ATLHawks @jcollins20_ @TheTraeYoung If Trae keeps on being Trae that means you won't get that much from collins and Hunter. @TheTraeYoung  has the ball in his hands way too much.
