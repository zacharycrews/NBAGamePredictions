It wasn't that mavs were playing good. There's a difference@LockedOnMavs Can you do an evaluation on how Mitchell Robinson can fit with the @dallasmavs and what we could possibly give up? I think he could REALLY work out and be cheap ESPECIALLY since he’s just “running for cardio” in the words of the aforementioned Robinson. @NickVanExit@SpyrosVel @dallasmavs @luka7doncic @kporzee The first 2.2 games of the 2021 playoffs were good.
