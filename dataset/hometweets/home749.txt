They can be the 1st team to 40 wins this season with a victory today against San Antonio.

Wolves had a huge issue leaving shooters open, it shows how much a rim protector would help each and every weak side defender. They have to be perfectly positioned or it’s a dot to the corner. Also Phoenix playmakers are just unreal too. https://t.co/bq6jH7UWOq🐮☀️ # NBA 🌲🌵

#NBA75 #NBAAllStar #starters #NBATopShotThis@HML5150 @stephenHRNRP Damn. I'm jealous. I'm in Phoenix. I always try to go before the sun is up, but even when you go at 4am in summer, it's still hovering near 80-90°. I just wish they'd add some shade.
