#GamblingTwitter #ChicagoBulls https://t.co/zJHbzq9bNwThe @ChicagoBulls have started this season out on fire, surprising those who questioned this roster. Led by Demar Derozan &amp; Zach Lavine, this unit looks primed for a deep playoff run. But what exactly is the ceiling for this #Bulls team?

Personally had doubts they‚Äôd be this good but the stingy defense of Lonzo &amp; Caruso plus the exemplary play of DeRozan has made Chicago a strong contender.

I don't doubt we can beat the Bulls, but 3rd game off of a road trip? Against the Bulls at home? Tough https://t.co/arPvb6hlEp@grittyrepublic @CrazyImpla @kirkdavis14_ @KrashKoot @chicagobulls I agree with this. It‚Äôs a regular season win and it counts but there‚Äôs no need for Bulls fans to be ridiculous and say Vuc= Jokic in terms of importance to their teams.

The crowd at Bulls games is significantly more electric than any other team‚Äôs that I‚Äôve seen.

We have the best team/fans in the league. #BullsNationAlex Caruso is the Bob Brookmeyer of the Chicago Bulls.
