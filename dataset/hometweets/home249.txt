Joakim called him the p-word.  😆😆😆😆@bastosbet @1 Chicago Bulls t'en pense quoi gro?@kdgg09 @chicagobulls @JoakimNoah @justdon First play I thought of,  and glad it was the first response I saw.@warriors 🆚 @Raptors

Pick me!@chicagobulls @NBCSChicago @670TheScore I’m coming home tonight! 👀🔴The @ChicagoBears just find ways to lose. If Coach Nagy and GM Pace are not fired after this game or Thanksgiving, win or lose Thursday, I'm done with this franchise until a change is made. Thank goodness the @chicagobulls have done the exact opposite. #losers #HHHRacingPodcast@chicagobulls @NBCSChicago I need one because I’m a big fan and that bobble head is so cool. I neeed it because I need another collectible. When I was 5 I ate my brothers Michael Jordan Wheaties box and wore his Michael Jordan watch.@chicagobulls @NBCSChicago Joakim is the heart, hustle &amp; muscle of Chicago and it showed not only on the court but off it as well as seen through his charity, @NoahsArcFdn. He put on a show for every single fan that came to see him play regardless of where they sat and showed love https://t.co/1e9zuQo25tMy beloved, unselfish, uptempo, entertaining, life-giving Chicago Bulls visit the pitiful Brooklyn Nets in two weeks; my goal is to start an MVP chant for one of the Bulls (doesn't matter who) and eventually get kicked out of Barclays for heckling. Watch this space.@KingJames @Money23Green @OhioStateFB Go Chicago bulls@chicagobulls @NBCSChicago This is why...I literally PRAYED for the BULLS to draft him the night before the draft... Then I was lucky enough to meet him in the airport a few weeks later... All I want for Christmas is a Joakim Noah bobblehead!!! https://t.co/d4VonCRshi@chicagobulls @JoakimNoah @justdon Joakim was at an event in Naperville which was shutdown early due to the massive amount of people that came out to see him. Instead of leaving, Jo asked everyone who was there to see him to go outside where he signed autographs for everyone even though it was snowing and cold.@jasonbenetti @Stacey21King @chicagobulls @nyknicks @NBCSChicago Go Bulls@chicagobulls @JoakimNoah @justdon The dunk on @paulpierce34 in the 2009 playoffs, anytime the double pistols where used, clapping at bosh when he was arguing with chalmers, winning the DPOY in 2014, and the Cleveland speech just to name a fewBulls play tonight to save our Sunday Chicago@chicagobulls @NBCSChicago I’m a HUGE Noah fan. I’ve donated to his charity - “rock your drop.” I love seeing what his mother does with the children of Chicago in their organization. I’ve been a Bulls fan through thick and thin, but even became fans of the teams Noah &amp; Rose played on too.@chicagobulls @JoakimNoah @justdon The steal and dunk against the Celtics. That was dope@chicagobulls @JoakimNoah @justdon Always loved when he would make a great shot he would do the double barrels shots with his hands.@chicagobulls @JoakimNoah @justdon I remember when we drafted him, I followed him in college and then my aunt had called me and said “we drafted your guy!” I was stoked to say the least!

On the road, you will see warriors and Lakers fans everywhere, followed by bulls. They have a broad fans base because of Jordan@Turaynel @KrashKoot @chicagobulls As a suns fan everyone apparently cares about injuries and call it a “fluke run” because other teams can’t stay healthy lmfao.

Jordan outscored rookie Scottie Pippen by a mere 27.1 points a game that season. https://t.co/yn3JGLKZYJ https://t.co/nHYEIvQTVM@stephenasmith I think you should watch more @chicagobulls basketball because, sir, this is the take of someone who looked at them on paper without watching them play outside of maybe a couple highlights. https://t.co/nhEz3PXOKm@MariuszKlimek13 @chicagobulls I don't think I would go after Simmons, I think what the Bulls should really be looking at is a guy like Myles Turner. Not sure what it would take to get him, but with the NBA looking to make an example out of the Bulls and Heat it might have an impact on any moves the Bulls make@bluegoh Yes! A lot that I haven’t actually talked to but in the summer of 2016 and 2017 I went to a basketball camp in Chicago and got pictures with DWade and Jimmy was there too since he was playing for the bulls at the time and I luckily touched his right shoe which was amazing@chicagobulls As a Laker fan, Bulls got my money on winning the whole thing.

One of my favorites.West Coast trip shows Bulls can play small-ball as well as any team - Chicago Daily Herald https://t.co/bBjqCOSAYqSaying it now, the Chicago bulls are winning the championship@LawofTD Chicago Bulls I think??@cettobin @angelcartierr @nuggets @chicagobulls Jokic chokes in the playoffs offs though🤔@chicagobulls  y’all turn! https://t.co/8yWipMNLOj@chicagobulls Not the Bulls problem that Jokic couldn't play. You beat the team as a whole, not the individual.  And to whoever was asking if Ben Simmons was a good fit for the Bulls? heck no! you don't want all that baggage that he brings, he's got attitude, can't shoot, and is drama queen.bruh the chicago bulls been playing like it’s nba street vol.2 for xbox and every possession they have the level 2 game breaker 😭I’m in deep, rural Mexico by myself for this wedding and almost every other person I’ve introduced myself to and told I’m from Chicago has immediately responded 

“Like the CHICAGO BULLS?”

Bulls are back baby@Nicholaspkirby Thank you! I was on a rooftop in RF for this one and actually exchanged words with a drunken former Chicago Bull who was salty I cheered for Jr’s HR.@BlazersInSeven @LerwickLuke @Zach_Prosperi @chicagobulls Yeah I mean them 3 together is a top 2-3 seed in the west, mostly because of Murray and jokic’s impact though. At this point I feel mpj wouldn’t add a whole lot to that though#NBA - the Chicago Bulls have put together a hellava team this year. Going to be up there come end of season.The Chicago Bulls are soo exciting to watch I know @Kofimagne is hype 😂😂Quette D - Back On My Bullspit (B.O.M.B) Clean NBA2k22 Entry by Quette D on #SoundCloud https://t.co/Yvxcvi4KX5
