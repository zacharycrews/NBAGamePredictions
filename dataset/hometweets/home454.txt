#sportsbetting #betting #sportspicks #gamblingtwitter #gamblingMonday's Free Pick: Utah Jazz -11.5

This looks like a good spot for the Utah Jazz to get back on track in blowout fashion tonight.  They have been upset in two straight games by the Spurs and Wizards in a back-to-back situation.  They had won eight straight prior to those twoThe Charlotte Hornets will be in Salt Lake City tonight to take on the Utah Jazz. 

Charlotte has not won in Utah since March 1, 2006, their longest drought in any NBA city. 

Charlotte has won in Seattle more recently than in Utah (Seattle hasn‚Äôt had a team since 2008). https://t.co/aL4zt0txqdI remember when back in the day, Michael Jordan played for the NBA championship with a rough case of c0vid, nobody objected to him being sick on the court vs Utah Jazz, and won the game. He was literally dripping.December 20th edition of DJ &amp; PK in the Morning

Pick : Utah Jazz.
Basketball. NBACharlotte will look to get back in the win column tonight against the Utah Jazz. https://t.co/0VOMXS6AlLAs usual, I try and find people who don't get the chance to go to the games and maybe give them that opportunity. #UtahJazzThe lost era of the Carlos Boozer led Utah Jazz fascinates me.

No one gives a fuck about those teams, but they were fairly consistently in the playoff picture.

They had a handful of deep runs and 50 win seasons but usually exited early.#UtahJazz I know it is very early in the day (I have been up since 2:30 and at work since 3:15) but there is no way I am getting to the Jazz game tonight.  So I am giving my tickets away again.  You have to follow and DM me if you want them.  Thanks. #TakeNote@VernonMaxwell11 @michaelschwab13 So right away, better than the Utah Jazz.Parlay
