South america support utah jazz!!@Emerantura Yep that’s how I’d feel. I’d be sad we lost out on a good recruit but some were saying they’d boycott the Utah Jazz because of Ryan Smiths rumored influence. It was nuts. But again that’s fringe fans, not the majority.

Y’all been needing to change it up for quite some time!@utahjazz @slcstars IMO this is crazy. If it were up to me, I'd assign Q to the Stars. How can you assess a player's NBA readiness based on 1-3 minutes per game. Elijah Hughes and Jared Butler deserved way better than this from the Team that drafted them.The @UtahJazz will honor active-duty military and veterans on Wednesday and Thursday night during the NBA's Hoops for Troops week.

Jazz rotation guys playing a ton of minutes early already.@utahjazz @slcstars Good. He can get some playing time, finally.@utahjazz @slcstars @DLocke09 you always say that you are the NBA/jazz insider but literally yesterday you said the jazz wouldn't assign butler to the stars. I think it may be time to stop calling yourself an insider if you don't even know something like this is gonna happen@ATLHawks @utahjazz @vivintarena @BallySportsSO @929TheGame Under or over Jazz by 25?@utahjazz @slcstars Should assign Quin to the G League for all the crap he pulls with rookies that should be in the regular rotation. https://t.co/MipR16R6MSOnly @ATLHawks vs @utahjazz is televised on @CignalTV. The other 2 games are on NBA League Pass. https://t.co/cwOpQsgvvW@coreyc04 @utahjazz @slcstars I mean true...I've just been on the Jared Butler hype train since the tournament lol. Want to see him thrive now.@kslsports @utahjazz Wondering if the ball is sticking anywhere before the shot???@Callystarr @utahjazz @slcstars I said play Forrest all last year. They never did until it was too late. Now they play Forrest over Butler? He was hesitant to shoot and didn't shoot well. They only play 9 in close games. Not room for both on the bench. Jazz starting lineup is slow.Unless Utah Jazz fans poisoned Scottie’s back, I don’t want to hear it https://t.co/wIvhYTpgvZ@utahjazz @ATTSportsNetRM @ZoneSportsNet @vivintarena We want Butler!Atlanta Hawks vs Utah Jazz 2021-22 NBA Season Preview, Predictions and Picks | SportsNus https://t.co/QTCFMqfH73@GobertOrGoHome @utahjazz @slcstars I mean Rudy played for them.

Seriously do they not? That would be cool.@utahjazz @slcstars Actually, I can see why. A lot more playing time, and getting better conditioning, and handling the ball a lot more@BensHoops @utahjazz Well written and researched article, Ben. Bottom line: it’s a Bitter Pill to swallow as to how the Team is performing so poorly in 3’s when it was one of their strongest suit last 2-3 seasons. Coach Q &amp; Staff must get this under control and return to their ‘Making’ Ways ASAP 🤞🤗@ATLHawks @utahjazz @vivintarena @BallySportsSO @929TheGame please fucking win@PhilipB207 @BobRathbunTV @ATLHawks @utahjazz @HawksOnBally @DWilkins21 @laurenjbara Own that freak@HeadbandRoyce @utahjazz @slcstars He doesn't deserve to go play basketball?@utahjazz @slcstars Probably to practice, then back to the team@HeadbandRoyce @utahjazz @slcstars I dont understand what he doesn't deserve. This allows him more playing time to get himself more comfortable in what the Jazz run. Im all for this. His pay rate is the same I believe as well, no matter what part of the team he is playing for.@utahjazz Until 5 hours later - recalled back tweet 😂  🤔@crazycole34 @utahjazz He needs to learn how to play within the system.@GobertOrGoHome @utahjazz @slcstars Jazz PR panicking to recall Jared Butler now.https://t.co/C9RyJpdbwV🏀TOP TIPS OF THE DAY🏀

#TakeNote @BensHoops https://t.co/pYVVvCpRsL@BobRathbunTV @ATLHawks @utahjazz @HawksOnBally @DWilkins21 @laurenjbara You owe the @warriors and @StephenCurry30 an apology.  You criticized them for Steph trying to get 50 points when he was making history as the oldest player to score 50 and have 10 assist. Shame on you!!Any Utah Jazz fans on here leme get a like@BobRathbunTV @ATLHawks @utahjazz @HawksOnBally @DWilkins21 @laurenjbara Did you run out of tissues last night?Utah Jazz and Miami Heat usually peak early during the regular season and fade away by the start of the post season, I ain't worried about those two .2 years, $6.8M.
  
That is how much it cost the #Sixers to sign Georges Niang away from the Utah Jazz.
 
https://t.co/tqLQmgpyDC@emman_exe2 @antonin_org Yeap. The only complicate teams for the @warriors this year are: @MiamiHEAT, @chicagobulls and maybe just maybe @utahjazz. The rest, it’s just a process. And we are playing without Klay and Wiseman. Just wait for those two and give us de Trophy already 🤣🤣@BobRathbunTV @ATLHawks @utahjazz @HawksOnBally @DWilkins21 @laurenjbara You okay this morning Bobby?
