#WBD #NBA #NBATwitter #NBA75@TheCatOnBallyTV Jin, the Atlanta Hawks moved from STL. The Pelicans are in New Orleans and moved there from Charlotte, I'm not sure why them coming here would be returning them to their rightful place? 

Also, if they were going to move an NBA team to STL I would think it would be the Kings.Tonight's starting lineup for the New Orleans Pelicans: Graham, Hart, Jones, Ingram, Valanciunas https://t.co/bVWH4AMCA2This is true. My grandfather’s nickname was actually “Ole Pelican Marlow.” His dying wish was for the New Orleans Pelicans to return to their rightful home in the Gateway to the West. https://t.co/uesqrZJljZRT to join the prayer circle

https://t.co/BWTCfua4XP https://t.co/THmWvj2gg7New Orleans Pelicans@TheCatOnBallyTV Rightful place? The Pelicans were formerly the Charlotte Hornets. You're thinking of the Hawks, who were in STL from '54-'68, winning the franchises lone title in '58.
