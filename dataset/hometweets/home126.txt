It has been a less than convincing start for the defending champions, but even with injuries they are still 4-4 and I believe in them tonight.Hey guys, the Milwaukee Bucks won the 2021 NBA finals. They swept the team that eliminated them last year, defeated the superteam Brooklyn Nets on their court in game 7 in OT, &amp; then they rallied to beat the Hawks in 6 games after Giannis suffered an apparent horrible leg injuryWho is a live dog tonight?

Right now I'm thinking Knicks coming off a bad loss may be hungry to make a statement win in Milwaukee against a Bucks team dealing with some injuries.The Milwaukee Bucks are the NBA Champions. 

The New York Knicks are not.

I guess they’re not that smart in MilwaukeeThe original ATL Braves were founded 1871

The Milwaukee Bucks were founded January 1968

Baylor b-ball started 1907

All years of the goat

All 3 won it all this year - their enemy year

I bet on 2 of the 3 to win

Sports numerology is not as easy as U think

It goes ALOT deeperHey @BlooperBraves You need to come to #Milwaukee when the @Bucks play the @ATLHawks we all can hang 🤣 https://t.co/PAjTTZD5JoThat would imply this organization understands the history of this team, and the uniforms+a million other things proves they don't care.  They think the Milwaukee Bucks were discovered by Brandon Jennings https://t.co/5lHkaokADyWisconsin State Rep. @FrancescaHongWI with the Milwaukee Bucks Championship Trophy, and her new Bucks tattoo. https://t.co/752fniDWqn@shitimissIou famous basketball player on the milwaukee bucksGiannis Antetokounmpo is the next on the list. He is a gifted young basketball player from Greece who currently plays for the NBA’s Milwaukee Bucks. Giannis Antetokounmpo possesses an attractive physique and a fashionable appearance.
