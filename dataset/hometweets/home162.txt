https://t.co/EpoqCDXQzK@saintsfankeith @erecasner @chicagobulls @ATLHawks MJ has constantly said - including the doc and his HOF speech - that mentioning him means you also mention Scottie.

He’s been hurt so they put him on the G-league so he can get back to playing well gradually@chicagobulls when y’all getting the new bulls jersey for sale for the new players? 😭@statmuse @DeMar_DeRozan @chicagobulls Barf.

Unless you think that ridiculous defensive rating is going to hold despite a dozen years of evidence he badly hurts his teams defense.@gokyle1 @chicagobulls Literal Windy City legend@barstoolcarl Just make the red hoodie exactly the same but with unaffiliated lettering that says “CHICAGO”.

#9 Luol Deng (spent a lot of time in Chicago and always was a starting SF, was a part of a contender team)
#13 Joakim Noah (DPOY and big part of team)My thoughts about jerseys that Chicago Bulls should retire thread
From the past: 
#53 Artis Gilmore (1st or 2nd best Center in Bulls history) 
#91 Dennis Rodman (one of the most important parts of the second three peat, also the huge part of the legendary 72-10 season)@PieceOfAction @ZO2_ @chicagobulls @nyknicks oh really? So a Knicks hater for no reason…..what are you hiding? Who’s your team?@AntonioMango4 A good teammate doesn't leave that kind of behaviour behind uncalled out.  He was the best teammate to ALL the @chicagobulls and he STILL is @MichaelJordaan@KnicksBig15 @ZO2_ @chicagobulls @nyknicks Funny stuff.. but the Knicks are a fraud, and I’m not a Bulls fan!
