What do you think the outcome of the game will be?

#PWEBets@securinDaBagley @buddyhield @SacramentoKings How’s you put in on this?  On the auction site or was it something at the arena?@TheHoopCentral @joeylinn_ We beat them by 51 points last year come on now “all the time” 🙄 the Phoenix Suns are really the only team that actually beats us all the time tbh. Hell, even the Sacramento Kings beat us more than the clippers 😂@BShep40 @SacramentoKings I’m sure there are plenty of teams in the league that would love a 7’2-7’4” center that can handle the ball and spot up shoot. On top of great passing and then locking ability. There’s not really a situation I see anyone losing that trade@TrillBroDude @SacramentoKings Somebody rescue that mascot@ShockleyBowls If I am the @SacramentoKings i would trade for him because They’ve been futile for over 20 yearsThe 76ers have shown interest in De'Aaron Fox but the King's continue to be unwilling to make him available.

Sacramento still believe they can make the playoffs this year, even after a bad start.

This kind of thinking is exactly the reason why the franchise is mediocre. Insane. https://t.co/CxQer4mbc2The Clippers have lost 3 out their last 5 games. The Lakers roster is average at best. The  LA Kings have lost 4 straight games. The Sacramento Kings fired their head coach. Free agency hits the Dodgers. California is going thru a rough patch right now. #sportsnewsICYMI: @SJSUAthletics Legend Tariq Abdul-Wahad talks Doc Rivers, @SacramentoKings  Women's Basketball, Lebron, playing against Michael Jordan, @WNBA @Candace_Parker  &amp; more with @therealknelson - https://t.co/fut2olQN3D https://t.co/LOldRmbuEq@LakersNation The same old Song!! We, looking more and more like The Sacramento King s!! Vogel, Coach the same way  Walton Coach. Magic get rid of  Luke and then we pick Vogel who will we realize can't Coach!! Jennie, Fire Rob and him!! You Mess up!! A real Coach!!@SacramentoKings It's tough to win when everybody not named Buddy shot 2/20 on 3-pointers. Sometimes this isn't that difficult to figure out. No matter who the coach is if you don't make shots, you don't win.@SacramentoKings Oh wait too late@SacramentoKings This season is gunna be a another dumpster fire i already know it@blazersforreal A road game against the Kings. We got this one.

Interesting how the cheap upper bowl tickets are almost sold out and the lower bowl is a a ghost town. U need fans to create a winning culture. Lower the ticket prices and the G1C will be packed @SacramentoKings@SteveThunderfan To think, Seattle wanted the Kings to relocate from Sacramento. They dodged a really bad rebuild.Run a box zone defense and have davion front the the ball handler copy the warriors if u have too @SacramentoKings https://t.co/qoccEgMENw@SacramentoKings Like someone posted TT and MB35 were controlling the paint and they went up. Sub for starters never to see floor again down the stretch. It has already been proven the starters can’t finish games. Quit playing analytics and play to win with who is doing well.@DannyParkIRL @SacramentoKings @imanshumpert @DancingABC Lol yeah that aint happening@StocktonKings @LouisKing @SacramentoKings call this man upRT for Sacramento Kings fans https://t.co/uqIkZjT7fqThis might be the year I finally give-up being a Sacramento Kings fan.  

After 22 years, give me a reason not to.Why not Scottie Brooks for the @SacramentoKings8 points in 10 minutes. The Bruins must have been watching the Sacramento Kings last night.
What a disappointment. Game over.Some interesting details on Sacramento's coaching change and more on the Kings: https://t.co/NtrlrQX9y6Former Sacramento King Iman Shumpert Makes History With 'Dancing With The Stars' Win https://t.co/ZJas9gXY16 https://t.co/yNRbxVGHgd@MarcosBreton @SacramentoKings Unfortunately, without him there are no Sac Kings, no DoCo, nothing. So I can’t hate on him too much.The @Suns last loss this season was against the Sacramento Kings Oct 27th. They have won 13 straight since. #PhoenixSuns #NBA@Ryno023 @55buckets @SacramentoKings Nice jersey!
Hopefully he doesn’t have to wait another lifetime for the Kings to be good again!
