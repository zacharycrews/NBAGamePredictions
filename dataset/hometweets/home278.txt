The @StocktonKings got some talent and the @SacramentoKings need to bring some guys up to shake things up.@SimonStilesNBA Sources say the argument ended with Luke Walton coming back into the locker room and saying it should be. The Sacramento Kings then jumped him and poured Mac and Cheese into his ears. Sources tell ESPN.@byDavidGardner Lol I actually don‚Äôt mind this take bc turkey is only great if it‚Äôs smothered in gravy or fried. Ham is the Sacramento Kings of the meal options. For most black folks we know that Mac N‚Äô Cheese is the star of the show üòåü§§@ch0cablok @SacramentoKings I'd say refusing to work out is an indication you don't want to be there, being close to the person that wants to draft you means even more that finishing a season wouldn't matter u made my point 4 me.. like I said fake fans!!Someone named "Chris in Sacramento" called into the .@dpshow and made a bet that the Kings would make the playoffs. It didn't sound like @ChrisDuerr, but he could've disguised his voiceChris in Sacramento bets the Kings will make the playoffs with @andrewperloff with either a shower of shame or pie to the faceWhen @mitchrichmond23 got traded to the @SacramentoKings breaking up Run TMC, he "cried like a baby"

#PWEBets@securinDaBagley @buddyhield @SacramentoKings How‚Äôs you put in on this?  On the auction site or was it something at the arena?@TheHoopCentral @joeylinn_ We beat them by 51 points last year come on now ‚Äúall the time‚Äù üôÑ the Phoenix Suns are really the only team that actually beats us all the time tbh. Hell, even the Sacramento Kings beat us more than the clippers üòÇ@BShep40 @SacramentoKings I‚Äôm sure there are plenty of teams in the league that would love a 7‚Äô2-7‚Äô4‚Äù center that can handle the ball and spot up shoot. On top of great passing and then locking ability. There‚Äôs not really a situation I see anyone losing that trade@TrillBroDude @SacramentoKings Somebody rescue that mascot@ShockleyBowls If I am the @SacramentoKings i would trade for him because They‚Äôve been futile for over 20 yearsThe 76ers have shown interest in De'Aaron Fox but the King's continue to be unwilling to make him available.

Sacramento still believe they can make the playoffs this year, even after a bad start.

This kind of thinking is exactly the reason why the franchise is mediocre. Insane. https://t.co/CxQer4mbc2The Clippers have lost 3 out their last 5 games. The Lakers roster is average at best. The  LA Kings have lost 4 straight games. The Sacramento Kings fired their head coach. Free agency hits the Dodgers.
