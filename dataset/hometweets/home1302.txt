27 PTS
2 REB
2 AST
1 STL
2 BLK
10-20 FG
7-13 3P

On the road, no KD, Steph went scoreless in the 1st half, and Klay Thompson is the one who kept the game in reach with a 21-PT 1st half performance. https://t.co/T5fILvxWpn3. Golden State Warriors vs Toronto Raptors, Game 6 of the 2019 NBA Finals:

30 PTS
5 REB
2 STL
8-12 FG
4-6 3P
10-10 FT

Down 3-2, Klay scored 30 PTS in 32 MIN before leaving the game with a torn ACL. Unfortunate ending to what would have been another historic Game 6 performance. https://t.co/TuBi5LqZsA2. Golden State Warriors vs Houston Rockets, Game 6 of the 2018 WCF:

35 PTS
6 REB
2 AST
4 STL
13-23 FG

The Warriors had lost 2 games in a row and were 1 loss away from going home. Klay, once again, didn’t let that happen as he stepped up with his season on the line. https://t.co/apiFiUSvrM1. Golden State Warriors vs Oklahoma City Thunder, Game 6 of the 2016 WCF:

41 PTS

Also he tries hard to go in the paint more now. Takes a toll on his Jody even more which messes up his movement again.Two critical game 6s tonight as we have the Bucks and Celtics and Grizzlies Vs Warriors!!! Who stays alive and who goes home? 

#NBA #PLAYOFFS2022  #West #East #Boston #Milwaukee #GoldenState #Memphis #BallerCentral https://t.co/UVvim78Lxw@warriors We Believe 🫵🏽🏀🏀🏀🏀🏀@warriors GAMEDAY!! LFG!! Need us to transfer all the energy.@warriors Game six klay? #gamesixklay@OfficialNBARefs could someone explain why Fitzgerald is going to be in @warriors game after in the first game he didn’t follow the instructions of the replay center in 2plays in which he had called foul against GS and they had told him that was wrong but didn’t change it? @nbaThe @Warriors recruited K-pop idol @BamBam1A to be their global ambassador. His collaborative single with Oakland singer Mayzin, “Wheels Up,” came out in April. 

And that's just the start of K-pop's hold on the cultural zeitgeist. 

via @Nattotodd https://t.co/sGfDAeBNbw@warriors NBA will make sure Warriors loses tonight so there will be 7 games. I saw the script leaked. Screen shot this. It’s Friday the 13. Warriors will blow 3-1 lead. Connect the dots! Fans in that stadium better drink beer and throw the bottles at crooked refs!I’d really like to see the Celtics &amp; Grizzlies win tonight… not because I like either team, I just highly dislike the @Bucks &amp; @warriors 🤬🤬🤬Andrew Wiggins will be BIGTIME tonight!

Sorry about your sixers- wanted to see them make a much deeper run!@warriors Pls winOff to bed, need to witness Golden State Warriors finesse Memphis Grizzlies!! Ja Morant and his folks been making too much noise after the game 5 blowout.Draymond Green had 12 rebounds + assists in only 22 minutes of action in Game 5 😮

With Golden State's guards finding their shooting groove once again, he should hit his prop with ease

I honestly think had they had brooks every game the series would've gone 4-2 grizzlies winning. I still think Klay held onto Ja's waist on that game 1 layup miss for the win. Regardless it's been a great series.Seriously. The NBA finals are happening and they SHOULD ALL BE TALKING ABOUT THIS.

My pick is MEM, even tho they're visiting. Morant set a good course offensively, but with him out &amp; Adams in GSW is playing a new team.

No way they'll learn the difference in the span of a game.

This is an easy one. You won’t see golden state lose two in a row to this Ja-less Grizzlie team. Playing in Golden State is tough. Grizzlies only cover if they dominant inside like they did last game. LFG! #BettingPicks #Warriors #NBA #FreeBets https://t.co/ztNIbMsrRFYo, @warriors I hope y'all close this one out tonight, and kiss our championship chances buh-bye.

Man up, or see y'all in Cancun.@warriors @espn @957thegame @Rakuten Steph need to be selfish just like the old times@warriors @espn @957thegame @Rakuten I am betting mortgage money that Warriors will get whooped again and then at Memphis. They will blow a 3-1 lead once again. They just don’t have it anymore. The Trinity will split up after this season. Dub dynasty is over.

#GrizzInSeven #GoGrizzlies #Memphis @NBAonTNT https://t.co/AgmAIEC5q6@warriors This is the most pathetic ball playing I have ever seen in my life. I'm truly discussed to be a Warriors fan this evening. Even when the Warriors sucked in the 90s and 00s I don't recall offense and defense this horrible. So sad. @warriors@millyrock_18 @NBA @Bucks @warriors @celtics @memgrizz right-on!!@Lovejustaword1 @warriors That last game was quite pathetic. The worst defense and offense this squad has every played when big three play together. Hope they got a stern talking to and had to put in some overtime when it comes to practice because that kind of sloppy carelessness is a no go win or lose.@baygal30 @zay_irl @inondehfsusld @warriors Right I’m with you. 💯@penguins @warriors Lose tonight and you lose the series.

Time to start the younger and more energetic players instead of you 3 who are too old to keep up. Playing well one in three games will get you nowhere. Stop yapping!On this day in 2022, the No. 2 Grizzlies defeated the No. 3 seed Golden State Warriors in Game 6 of the 2nd Round to bring our boys home for an epic close out game 7. Games 5, 6, and 7 were eventually recognized as the beginning of a dynastic decade for the Memphis Grizzlies. https://t.co/tLiFV4yA4m@warriors We need the fearless Jorden Poole please , not that guy who played the other night@TimeoDubois56 @dubsforever7 @warriors @espn @957thegame @Rakuten Lol sadly@NotBKnight @Gsus_2 @DogSurfRoadshow @StephenCurry30 @Money23Green @KlayThompson @warriors You talk like GS gone win it all😂😂😂😂...

Ask Mike Brown to win first quarter in Game 6 and we can win the game. 

If he does, I’ll ask the #NBATwitter to vote for community assist.

Deal?@warriors play tonight. I need them to end it at home. I can’t take a game 7Watch Lebron annihilate the Golden State Warriors in style with this slick T-shirt. The shirt commemorates the game where Lebron dropped an impressive 56 points, proving that he is still the king of basketball.

I pray I'm very wrongI’m not saying the Warriors even get past Memphis, but any scenario that ends with a Golden State championship involves Suns having to play 7 games in the semis.@Ryeo_LoL @warriors Fuck you we gotta beat CP3 and the Griddy GremlinWe closing the game @warriors okay? Let’s go! #DubNationWhile I think the suns are gonna pull out this series everybody on that hype train saying that the @warriors aren't gonna beat the suns playing how they did last game?
