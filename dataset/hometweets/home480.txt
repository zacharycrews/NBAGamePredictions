Suns have been laser focused as of late. Booker is on a 20 game win streak when he plays and he is 47 points away from 10k points. With Wiggins, Poole, and Lee out today and this game being in Phoenix I expect a dominant win. Expect some props on this game. https://t.co/S7KUH1bJORMerry Christmas to everyone except Chris Paul and the Phoenix Suns.@butterrace Sucks that’s what covid is doing again.
