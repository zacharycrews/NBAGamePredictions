Way to keep eyes off of your team when you have such a fun young team!@CIeGuardians @CavsNotes @cavs @NBA Lebron is the goat who needs to come home.@_bigjayy_ is coming off a huge performance for the @cavs against Milwaukee on Monday (25 PTS, 10-12 FG, 9 REB, 2 BLK).

Allen already has 5 games of 25+ points this season, which is more than his first 4 @nba seasons combined (3 such games).

#LetEmKnowCompletely unbelievable! He should be forced to sell the Cleveland Cavaliers to LeBron James and his team immediately! https://t.co/YUTaAirchSA @cavs team without LeBron James has not made the postseason since 1998. This season's group of exciting young talent could change that, writes @JeffZillgitt. https://t.co/lPLUnEr5Xg.@evanmobley (293 PTS/38 BLK in 21 Games) needs 7 PTS and 2 BLK to become just the 2nd rookie in @cavs history to record 300+ PTS and 40+ BLK in 22 career games or fewer (John "Hot Rod" Williams had 369 PTS and 50 BLK in his first 22 career games in 1986-87).

#LetEmKnowBarcelona looking like how the Cleveland Cavaliers looked when Lebron James left for the Lakers.The @cavs will face the Chicago Bulls tonight for the first time this season. The Cavs went 2-1 against the Bulls in 2020-21.

Would rather have Sexton over Lillard anyways. Trade makes no sense. #cavs@SirYacht_ @cavs I would love to see this happen!@phaksoflyfejd @SirYacht_ @cavs Never once said or implied that in any way.

😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭@CLE2327 @SirYacht_ @cavs Doesn't matter. He will not be traded this season. Detrimental to the team right now with how he is producing. Keep being mad about it. And if he continues at this point to stay healthy then the cavs will likely resign him. Then you can really be mad@phaksoflyfejd @SirYacht_ @cavs When he has 1/5th the amount of player of the game's as he does games missed, let me know. Until then he's grossly overpaid to come off the bench, and is worth more in a trade than he is to bringing another title to Cleveland.@SirYacht_ @cavs No way you do that trade.  It's completely lopsided@CLE2327 @SirYacht_ @cavs Player of the game just the other night but I mean you seem to know since you go to all the games lol Stevie wonder ass.@CLE2327 @SirYacht_ @cavs What a funny guy 🙄 Kevin Love is playing good ball even if we trade him it will not come this year. If he keeps up maybe he will have some food offers in the off season. Personally the Cavs should keep him as a bench mark bc he is playing damn good.@phaksoflyfejd @SirYacht_ @cavs Worked wonders off the bench is more than a stretch.@phaksoflyfejd @SirYacht_ @cavs I like Kevin Love as much as anyone else. But to ignore the fact that he's been a scab holding back the rebuild since he resigned is just asinine at this point. Just admit you want him to fuck you lol@SirYacht_ @cavs You dump a big contract, a player you have to pay or he walks, and I young player who people see a lot of upside in.

But man next season when sexton slides back I like it so much more@SirYacht_ @cavs Getting rid of Love and his contract is the greatest part of the trade.@SirYacht_ @cavs I would prefer if the 2024 first round pick wasn’t there as well. That’s pretty expensive@MJH_straight_up @cavs Honestly don’t love this. BI fills a major hole but we lose a lot of depth. I mean just for this season it would look like DG-Rubio-BI-Mobley-JA. Off the bench Cedi, Satoransky, Windler, Stevens, Davis? Absolutely hate that bench unit lol@_nothingbutnet @cavs Buddy a better shooter which we need, reddish better 3 and D option and age wise fits the timeline perfect.
