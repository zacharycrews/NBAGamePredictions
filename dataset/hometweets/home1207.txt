2nd, They were eliminated last year by the eventual NBA Champions. Throw out last year's result.

3rd, odds in a vacuum might be correct but needs to factor in Nets odds vs. opponents odds, and Nets come out on top.@MiamiHEAT @DoorDash This should be the starting lineup for the playoffs.

Both former Heat players. You need as much depth going into the playoffs as possible and those two players make you even stronger defensively preparing for Nets or Bucks#MiamiHeat clinched the first seed in the NBA #EasternConference as the @Bucks dominated the @Celtics.

Man Boston are rolling on at the moment. East playoffs going to be real good@jhirron @oprahsideclark Can we be honest if the pandemic would have never happened &amp; that 5 month break didn’t happen. Lakers is not winning that year simple . They played the Miami heat in the finals that year like cmon stop it. Probably the most boring finals ever. Shit was like watching pick up YMCAWhat would be the best city to be a sports fan of? 

Miami: Dolphins, Heat, Marlins, Panthers, Miami FC, The U 

Chicago: Bears, Bulls, Cubs/Sox, Blackhawks, Fire, Northwestern? lol 

Boston: Sox, Pats, Celtics, Revolution, Bruins, Boston College 

Who else??@specimen7777777 @FirstTake @MiamiHEAT @HeatvsHaters I love it@MiamiHeat_fan22 Missed the dunk got fouled. It would’ve been insane@MiamiHEAT @Heat_Lifer305 @VicOladipo Does this mean he is back in the rotation???@Timmaaay_ @NBA @MiamiHEAT @Hennessy I would love to see the Heat live in that arena@MiamiHeat_LATAM Lowry@NBA2K_MyTEAM I need a dark matter Miami heat Chris bosh to complete my Miami big three I have the opal but the #4 just looks so ugly in a heat uniMeanwhile, the future that we are looking at here in Miami is... hot. So hot that humans can't survive outside. By 2060, the map below tells how many days a year that's going to be. Miami is a shade of ...brown?(over 100 days per year of unbearable heat)
