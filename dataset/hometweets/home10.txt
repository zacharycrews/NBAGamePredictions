Any truth to the rumors that Jingles will be wearing his medal under his singlet to taunt Gids…@NBCSChicago @NBCSBulls @utahjazz Bear is in the HOF and won Mascot of the Year three times but is 25? Not that I care but it discredits the listZero sleeps for #UtahJazz heart break. #TakeNote@andrewbogut @NBA @utahjazz @okcthunder @Joeingles7 @joshgiddey Jazz by heaps. But will be loving the ball movement from OKC should they continue with where they were last week again Denver. Great to watch, same as the Warriors ball movement yesterday. A much much better product to watch, than all the one out shit!!5 Bold Predictions for the Utah Jazz

1. The Jazz win 60 games
2. Donovan Mitchell finishes top 3 in scoring
3. Jared Butler makes an all-rookie team
4. The Jazz are "involved" in massive trade before the deadline
5. The Jazz advance further in playoffs than last year

Let's go!@utahjazz 😉👍💀

Utah Jazz as Hidden Leaf squad makes sense as Donovan Mitchell and Shikamaru have matured greatly since their graduations/draft. What was once annoying inconsistencies sparkled with talent has been replaced with steady growth into being a world class player/ninja.Bigger than basketball.

Granted, he IS a rookie, and has much to learn.  But if @DLocke09 can be believed, Jared has been amazing during practice and is learning at a quick rate. At the least he will give Utah some quality spot minutes against second unitsThis might be hasty, but I want to bet on the Atlanta Hawks versus the Utah Jazz being the finals matchup this year.@mayoroflasvegas @NBA @Lakers @LAClippers @utahjazz @Suns @CityOfLasVegas @CityofSeattle @ArashMarkazi I’m all for these cities getting a team.

#GoJazz https://t.co/DZevxGSj91@Sweatshirt25 @BleacherReport @BrooklynNets @Bucks @utahjazz @Lakers Point is, I actually believe in the Lakers more than I probably should, it can go really bad if Russ can’t co-exist with Lebron and AD or if one of them gets injured, then they could be a .500 team hoping to be in the play-in…@ChrisBHaynes @DLocke09 This is an honest mistake guys…I mean how many times have you gone to type @utahjazz and “accidentally” typed @nuggets ? I know it happens to me all the time!@mconley11 @utahjazz Good luck. Kill it.@FreedumFyghter @BleacherReport @BrooklynNets @Bucks @utahjazz @Lakers Point is jazz ain’t beating lakers let alone making it to the WCF no worries everyone has a little bias in them@utahjazz Zero time all star Mike Conley boutta shock the league by missing the all star team again #hottakeAlright Jazz fans, what’s it going to be this year — how far do the @utahjazz need to go for you to be satisfied?@mconley11 @utahjazz Love you Mike@utahjazz Ready to choke in the playoffs?@utahjazz hey jazz! go get the dub tmr!@anne2themax @utahjazz Oh man, delete this, Anne…@Sweatshirt25 @BleacherReport @BrooklynNets @Bucks @utahjazz @Lakers Was upset by the Clippers when I think Sugar K got injured sometime during that round, that’s the unpredictable thing about sports, maybe Suns wouldn’t have gotten to the finals if he wasn’t hobbled🤷🏼‍♂️ Kawhi’s injury this year still has lasting effects for everybody compadre…Western Conference

Make your own predictions if you want to call it how you see it…Anthony Davis and the Utah Jazz are the same thing to me.New Deadspin Post: Success won’t be so easy for the Utah Jazz this time around https://t.co/udb49Bms0w@KurtisGoebel @notthefakedwill @Murse_Gaylord btw, over on Atlanta Hawks and Utah Jazz for this season #lockitin@TheCribBoredaf @utahjazz 🙄🙄🙄🙄 ok ok@0zee_ @utahjazz No where near close 🥶🥶@TheCribBoredaf @utahjazz i was closeeeeeeee@FreedumFyghter @BleacherReport @BrooklynNets @Bucks @utahjazz @Lakers First off buddy Jazz is definitely not making it to the WCF so try again and start there (not being a troll just calling it how I see)@thebearto @ChrisBHaynes Typo? Hate when my keyboard autocorrects Utah Jazz to Memphis Grizzlies. 

Who’s coming out?@Sweatshirt25 @BleacherReport @BrooklynNets @Bucks @utahjazz @Lakers Well, it’s not a list, it’s season ending standing predictions and you could actually put in the effort to show me how it will really end up or you just like being a shitty troll?DwyaneWade: RT @mconley11: Ready for 15 @utahjazz https://t.co/9KY090BounDwyaneWade: RT @utahjazz: No anniversary team without the all-time assist leader. 

Congratulations to John Stockton on being named to the #NBA75 Anniversary Team! 💎 https://t.co/sDYibL08B2@Johnathen_Adams @vegasfeverpod @ScottyDrowned @Lakers @nuggets @Suns @utahjazz @warriors @dallasmavs @LAClippers @memgrizz @trailblazers @PelicansNBA @DSM_Media My reasoning behind the 7 seed is simply because Kawhi will miss some time through out this season. 

Depending on when he’s back could change it for me.@_ScottyTalks @vegasfeverpod @ScottyDrowned @Lakers @nuggets @Suns @utahjazz @warriors @dallasmavs @LAClippers @memgrizz @trailblazers @PelicansNBA @DSM_Media Idk exactly but they won’t be in the play in.

I'll hang up and listen.It’s only fitting that Derrick Favors plays against the Utah Jazz in his debut game as a member of the OKC Thunder tomorrow.@jeppsen4 @utahjazz I’d rather get a stick shoved up my nose 🤷🏻‍♀️@5kl @utahjazz This seems accurate@hatingKans @utahjazz Sam Merrill and Elijah Bryant got one last year with Milwaukee.
