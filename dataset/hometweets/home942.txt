If we're going off that premise, it's Cade.  Also, and this isn't a stretch, if you put Cade on Cleveland he probably has better #s.  If I was re-drafting today, Cade is 1 and Mobley is 2. Cade's that dude.@TimD56 @wxyzdetroit Don‚Äôt forget @TomGores while he didn‚Äôt inherit the team from daddy, is one of the worst owners in all of sports far as win percentage, which is .395% a 332-509 record, 0-8 in playoffs. @DetroitPistons@DetroitPistons @HenryFordNews It would be nice to have Saben available if Cade doesn‚Äôt play.

https://t.co/LcCBBkwPJ5@Arda @espn @DetroitPistons @chicagobulls Our favorite ‚Äújam‚Äù‚Ä¶ https://t.co/bQQ8hNArWVI am a believer in the @DetroitPistons rebuild. I think in 3 years you're looking at what Phoenix has right now.  Cade/Bey/Grant a big 3.. Beef Stew the rim protecter, Killian Hayes a solid 6th man and a stud like Banchero. This is a team that will score and play defense!The Golden State Warriors should start Giannis against the Detroit Pistons #Pistons #DubNation https://t.co/C2XRzrF6hu@woodwardsports @IOntiveroz @bball_ref @DetroitPistons @CadeCunningham_ The ceilings aren‚Äôt close though. Cade will be expected to win you playoff series‚Äôs (when they get there), Mobley might be expected to win you some games. Like Luka v AytonI'm finally accepting of Chet Holmgren for the Detroit Pistons. 43% from 3, and 3.5 blocks a game? From the CENTER SPOT? Opening the lanes for Cade? Could be a 3rd option behind Cade and Grant.
Cade
Grant
Holmgren
Bagley

If not Holmgren, Jaden Ivey or Banchero are fine too.The @DetroitPistons are 2-15-2 OU (-6.3 ppg) at home with no rest comming off road game.

Mobley is a throwback skilled big that rim protects and doesn‚Äôt force the game. Cade is a combo guard that can score on all 3 levels and a good young leader already. 50-50@woodwardsports @bball_ref @DetroitPistons @CadeCunningham_ It‚Äôs a combo of being on a bad team - and not being a quirky-athletic, highlight reel player.
