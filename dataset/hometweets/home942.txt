If we're going off that premise, it's Cade.  Also, and this isn't a stretch, if you put Cade on Cleveland he probably has better #s.  If I was re-drafting today, Cade is 1 and Mobley is 2. Cade's that dude.@TimD56 @wxyzdetroit Don’t forget @TomGores while he didn’t inherit the team from daddy, is one of the worst owners in all of sports far as win percentage, which is .395% a 332-509 record, 0-8 in playoffs. @DetroitPistons@DetroitPistons @HenryFordNews It would be nice to have Saben available if Cade doesn’t play.

https://t.co/LcCBBkwPJ5@Arda @espn @DetroitPistons @chicagobulls Our favorite “jam”… https://t.co/bQQ8hNArWVI am a believer in the @DetroitPistons rebuild. I think in 3 years you're looking at what Phoenix has right now.  Cade/Bey/Grant a big 3.. Beef Stew the rim protecter, Killian Hayes a solid 6th man and a stud like Banchero. This is a team that will score and play defense!The Golden State Warriors should start Giannis against the Detroit Pistons #Pistons #DubNation https://t.co/C2XRzrF6hu@woodwardsports @IOntiveroz @bball_ref @DetroitPistons @CadeCunningham_ The ceilings aren’t close though. Cade will be expected to win you playoff series’s (when they get there), Mobley might be expected to win you some games. Like Luka v AytonI'm finally accepting of Chet Holmgren for the Detroit Pistons. 43% from 3, and 3.5 blocks a game? From the CENTER SPOT? Opening the lanes for Cade? Could be a 3rd option behind Cade and Grant.
Cade
Grant
Holmgren
Bagley

If not Holmgren, Jaden Ivey or Banchero are fine too.The @DetroitPistons are 2-15-2 OU (-6.3 ppg) at home with no rest comming off road game.

Find out who we are taking in this matchup. #SportsBetting #NBATwitter https://t.co/ZhWw9FHqtS@woodwardsports @bball_ref @DetroitPistons @CadeCunningham_ I like both of what they bring to the game equally. Mobley is a throwback skilled big that rim protects and doesn’t force the game. Cade is a combo guard that can score on all 3 levels and a good young leader already. 50-50@woodwardsports @bball_ref @DetroitPistons @CadeCunningham_ It’s a combo of being on a bad team - and not being a quirky-athletic, highlight reel player.
