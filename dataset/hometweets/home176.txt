If the latter, then why?@nbafan242 @HoodieLaMelo @zZzTyler_ @statmuse @russwest44 @Lakers @okcthunder @HoustonRockets @WashWizards He didn’t play the whole series. He played hurt and came back early because his team just lost two in a row and then they closed out the series. Who would have guessed you’d move the goal posts again just as I said you would. Surprise surprise. Predictable@trailblazers @HoustonRockets @ROOTSPORTS_NW @RipCityRadio620 Can y’all figure a deal out with Hulu . All this streaming going to mess up my computer@HoustonRockets Neymar Jr

I can find horrendous clips of the Detroit pistons or Houston Rockets right now and make it look worse than college players hahah@HoustonRockets At least the cartoon dildo rocket isn’t on the front
I still don’t know why they ever went away from the championship era design it was a classic and timeless. These ones though are 100% better than the late 90s versionsNBA Live Scores: Game open!

Russ is incredible. He's an MVP who has played his entire career with MVPs and Superstars. On elite team after elite team. And yet...

And some point you have to realize that HE is the problem.@713YeezyStunna @HoustonRockets Yes plz just keep Silas as an assistant coach lol@HoustonRockets Great job!!

I wonder how much money went into making that intro video, though? It looked like it was well before its time when it came out in 1999.@RoFlo @HoustonRockets Let’s take this one step further and put RoFlo up where this was. https://t.co/twbGu0yK10@KLOEforLIFE @statmuse @russwest44 @Lakers @okcthunder @HoustonRockets @WashWizards Russ doesnt deserve to be called a loser never had a losing a season always in the playoffs some stars dont have that@BenSanders_14 @nbafan242 @statmuse @russwest44 @Lakers @okcthunder @HoustonRockets @WashWizards I'd say Danny Green has contributed more towards winning a 🏆  than Russ, definitely.

Danny is the perfect role-player.

He can fit his game into almost any situation and actually improves his team's chances of winning.

He did it in San Antonio, Toronto, LA, and Philly.@nbafan242 @HoodieLaMelo @zZzTyler_ @statmuse @russwest44 @Lakers @okcthunder @HoustonRockets @WashWizards Without him last season yall would be in the lottery 😂 and stuck with john wall ungrateful mfkers 😂Tonight's starting lineup for the Houston Rockets: Porter Jr., Green, Tate, Wood, Theis https://t.co/bVWH4Av1bs@HoustonRockets Damn all that just to get blown out@tkshelper @GollaShepard @zZzTyler_ @statmuse @russwest44 @Lakers @okcthunder @HoustonRockets @WashWizards Russ never had a losing season@King28Wolf @statmuse @russwest44 @Lakers @okcthunder @HoustonRockets @WashWizards u got a point https://t.co/AdbiiL0S1N@xxxmatentacion @Surge_HD @statmuse @russwest44 @Lakers @okcthunder @HoustonRockets @WashWizards I don't think a chip is the only team accomplishment. 

Lebron doesn't have as many 🏆s as a lot of players but he has lead his team to the finals 10 times. 

Those, to me, are team accomplishments.@HoustonRockets Cursed@nbafan242 @straightstan @zZzTyler_ @statmuse @russwest44 @Lakers @okcthunder @HoustonRockets @WashWizards He just carried your shitty franchise to the playoffs and you hating? Go find love my boy@HoustonRockets Harrell 4@BenSanders_14 @statmuse @russwest44 @Lakers @okcthunder @HoustonRockets @WashWizards It doesn't discredit his individual accomplishments, it just means he only has individual accomplishments.

You are right about Melo and Harden but I disagree with CP3. He lead a team that had never been to the playoffs all the way to the Finals. 

That sets him apart for me.@HoustonRockets Chris Gary, 92@GollaShepard @zZzTyler_ @statmuse @russwest44 @Lakers @okcthunder @HoustonRockets @WashWizards wtf u talking about russ a 2x playoff misser.Algo is predicting a very close game in the NBA tonight between Houston Rockets and Portland Trailblazer. So the good value bet is taking Houston + 9 over Portland. 86 percent of the simulations have Houston covering the spread getting 9. So good value at - 160@HoustonRockets @creditkarma @RafaelStone12 @PJFertitta can we please at least color match the Credit Karma logo on the Rockets jerseys?! Jerseys look so amazing just to be ugified with clashing color logo.Houston Rockets Put "Travis Scott Day" On Hold Following Astroworld Tragedy‼️🚨#uaccessmagazine https://t.co/AvEunueKNI@nbafan242 @HoodieLaMelo @zZzTyler_ @statmuse @russwest44 @Lakers @okcthunder @HoustonRockets @WashWizards Good argument. “Other than the times he’s won tell me when he’s won.” Haha. 🤡@50NuancesDeNBA houston rockets winThe Rockets are mixing the old with the new on their city edition jerseys. 🔥

#NBATwitter #NBAPicks #SportsBetting #GamblingTwitter https://t.co/B6nqny0krTAll trolling aside (hatred toward the Houston Rockets) I've been thinking about why they are playing their veterans so many mins

The only thought is they must be trying to up their values to move them at the deadline

My thinking is, if you're going to be 1-10, play your rookies@TatesBurner @HoustonRockets Monday, the 15th.@HoustonRockets I think it's time for #RocketsTwitter to reassemble at one of these games.

Cleveland Guardians / Houston Rockets https://t.co/GOLuyppiN8Who will win more Games this Season @HoustonRockets or @HoustonTexans ?@izzypvh Right, but you’re missing the entire point of John Wall being ok with not playing. The Sixers want Ben Simmons to play, but he doesn’t want to for them. Rockets and Wall both want him to be traded from Houston and are willing to sit all year even if they have to@GQSports @JalenGreen @HoustonRockets Inspirational@chance12653259 @HoustonRockets @creditkarma First and foremost. You're talking about College Cade. Not the same game. Secondly. Cade is passing the rock to the WORST offensive rated team in the NBA, and the WORST 3 point shooting team in the league. You're not gonna get your assists if you don't have guys who can shootNorman Powell is dealing with a left quad strain and is questionable for Friday’s game against the Houston Rockets.

The @sixers are fighting for the playoffs….clearly a reason you shouldn’t just shut up and pay a guy not to play.
