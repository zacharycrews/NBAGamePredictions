I'm a Kings fan too. Sacramento fans are so desperate they'd go to an event like that a for a building where nothing significant was accomplished on the court. Not one thing.@KeithJouganatos I love this and I have one opinion that i saw fans carryings boxes, some of them fans forever, for decades, even those that helped keep the Kings in Sacramento and that's awesome.
