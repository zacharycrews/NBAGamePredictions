The @SacramentoKings treated him like crap. Instead of standing behind him they caved to the woke mob. At the end of the day he was right. Everyone matters in life.@ImB0nkerzz @XxNoknifexX @mindofSwift1 @AlexKennedyNBA Man I hate to admit it, but the timberwolves and Sacramento kings have been in rebuild mode since the mid 2000's 🥴Arco arena was a place where the Sacramento kings played from 1988 and 2016 and thousands of people showed up.

@SacramentoKings https://t.co/ODvjUD5JK7Got to enter Arco Arena one last time today😢 so many childhood memories in this building from @SacramentoKings games to concerts. I’m bummed I never got to take kash to a game here but I definitely had him with me today🤞👑🏀💜 #ARCOFarewell https://t.co/hp6f3K2KiiMy mom and I were at the farewell event for ARCO/ Sleep Train Arena, former home of the @SacramentoKings. This will be my first/ final time inside here. There was a big turnout today.

It will be nice to meet more people from the community IRL. My sign for the game look for me on TV. #NBATopShotThis @roham @Eisenberg43 https://t.co/JEzU8jApkq@Steve_Tuck @SacramentoKings Yeah-it was one of the poorly executed events we attended. Hardly any management folks around to direct crowd and the merch tent was ransacked by the first few hundreds who came &amp; left nothing for other fans. @SacramentoKings didn't organize it well &amp; keep it memorable for others@SacramentoKings Where’s @GrantNapearshow ?@SacramentoKings the event today was an absolutely shit show. As thrilled as I was to enjoy the farewell event, the staffing was embarrassing. Not only was their a lack of coordination, but we couldn’t even acquire any memorabilia because of greedy individuals and the looting.#Sacramento Best moments at Arco Arena? Gsp winning(I was there)1st title? Male Dancers booed off court? Kobe Bryant bionic elbow to Mike Bibby's beak?

#TopShotKingdom https://t.co/WZgyiOm13K@SacramentoKings Did you guys notice that more people showed up today than are showing up to your games? Take a minute to think about why.@_ItsYaBoyBreezy @SacramentoKings BothSerious question. Do the #SacramentoKings have fans? How is the fan base? Who owns a #Kings jersey? Team been bad for so long I don’t think they even have fans@BeeTatted916 @SacramentoKings Why when you got Sabonis?@Steve_Tuck Yeah, it was pretty crazy...took us an hour in line...and poorly organized by @SacramentoKings management...heard this comment from many there!@julezeverywhere @SacramentoKings There is a wrestling tomorrow in Elk Grove bro. You should come!The problem with “resting” players @SacramentoKings &amp; @mmcnair is that they won’t ever be prepared for playoffs, if they are healthy let them play, if they need rest, let them rest but we all want a championship eventually so must be preparing that mentally@StocktonKings @SacramentoKings I hope tye Stockton kings won't hire Gentry! Hebis horrible!This is not gonna be a pleasant tweet. Bauce is in downtown Sacramento by the Kings Arena. I am truly embarrassed to see Sac have development near a sports venue. Oakland has nothing even compared to this. @Kaplan4Oakland  @NoelGallo5  @ShengForOakland @nikki4oakland@SacramentoKings You tools forgot Grant. @GrantNapearshow was a part of the organization for over 30 years and I listened to him call the games growing up. You can pretend he wasn’t a huge part of your organization but he is.@AlanHolder3 @SacramentoKings I’m sorry I had to leave to walk the puppy and couldn’t meet you all!@_petethetrainer thanks to @SacramentoKings and @danajacobson@SacramentoKings @GrantNapearshow and Jerry should be there.Drew timmie to Sacramento @SacramentoKings@SacramentoKings @Vivek This event was complete bull shit! Only worth it for the VIP and ST holders. The little general population of Kings fans got jack shit in a three hour line. Event should have spanned over a week to avoid the large crowd. Poorly planned event to send off Arco.@SacramentoKings @GrantNapearshow should be in this photo. Disgrace how they did himFarewell Old Barn.

So it makes me more nauseous. Now they probably want to take Timme 😂 that dude came to play.The Kings need to draft Drew Timmy from Gonzaga @SacramentoKings@SacramentoKings  I’m to get drew Timmy from GonzagaBREAKING: The Sacramento Kings are “taking a serious look” at Drew Valentine being their head coach for the 2022-23 season and beyond, sources tell me. His brother, Denzel, currently plays for the Maine Celtics of the G League after having a respectable 5 year career for Chicago.@Ftnirish44 @CarmichaelDave @Sports1140KHTK @SacramentoKings Really appreciate the support!4th best coach in Sacramento Kings history on the verge of the Sweet Sixteen.@spanishgodish @SacramentoKings I would’ve been there too but work :(@toffhibee @pocketjanitor @SacramentoKings It smelled like chalk in there.@toffhibee @SacramentoKings Thanks!

Dudes were playin in dressesThe media keeps spouting off about  "the Sacramento Kings are having a going away party for the old Arco Arena.

Even said so on the tickets people ordered online.@someguynamedg It’s just so disappointing. Every sports league will have their bottom dwellers, but even the Sacramento Kings spend and try. Less competition in any form is bad for the game.Welp. We didn't make it inside but at least we got this photo. 💜🖤💜

That purple blood is THICK. 💜 https://t.co/rMeXE3n6S4@lovethyKings @SacramentoKings @CarmichaelDave Too bad our group stopped season tickets a few years ago. AJ and I would have kept doing our 1/4 season but none of the other groups wanted to. So we had to wade through the thousands of others. Sadly most of the memorabilia was gone. Still cool to see the barn one last time.@SacramentoKings @SacramentoKings what an awful experience. Got there at 2:30pm, the line for free gear was already wrapped around the whole event. The people who had just gotten out of tents told me it wasn’t worth waiting for. There were like 5-6 food trucks to serve thousands? What a mess.New listing!

Lakers GM was 90% completed with that Sacramento Kings trade, was talked out of it on some what about if Lebron got injured foolishness. Don’t pay 91 M for a PGSad to see a poorly run even by the kings. The end of ARCO is consistent with the kings organization since 2004.  Waited 30 minutes to get in to be told no more memorabilia and we couldn’t see inside ARCO. No wall to write on either.@CarmichaelDave @SacramentoKings @outlawtorn916 https://t.co/0I4Chnar3R@SacramentoKings Wish I could have gone inside.  Was great to be there though, and see all the great fans who showed up.  Pretty amazing how many were there.

Especially all the kids clothes, that would’ve been so perfect for my niece https://t.co/rfWxAWzmZh@Sacrame34348053 @alejandrozi_ @SacramentoKings The maloofs bought the kings after the kings already had vlade, Webber, Jason Williams, and adelman. The maloofs did not put any winning prices together. This is a huge misconception among kings fans. Maloofs bought the kings after that squad’s first playoff season@SacramentoKings That is insulting.🦁👑 X @SacramentoKings

Listening to the broadcasting highlights of you, @KozNBCS, and @JasonRoss1140 were spectacular. “I’m high fiving as many fans as possible behind me.” Also hearing “NO HE DIDN’T! YES! HE! DID!” was something I could broadcast with the highlight itself.One thing I've learned VERY quickly living in Sacramento: Kings fans love their Kings. Incredibly admirable given the awful run they've been on for 16 years. https://t.co/x0QMiSg0yH@DeezzyTrill Do better @SacramentoKings@SacramentoKings

The good thing about that is no one expects the Kings to win, so you can just be in the moment and enjoy the experience. No expectations, no disappointment. 😁

#Aztec4Life@SacramentoKings Vivek: Didn’t I save this franchise from playing here? Why are they so happy to be back?@rob40cal @SacramentoKings There is a big line to get in the arena probably take you two hours or more to get in and another line to get free stuff.Got a handful of photos at the outgoing #ArcoArena or as it’s actual name goes, #SleepTrainArena. So long, Arco! See you in the history books. @SacramentoKings #SacramentoProudNBA folks who talk nasty about Kings fandom should experience the Arco farewell event. I had to walk a mile to find the end of the queue. The crowd at this event is insane.
NBA just wait till this team becomes any good, Sacramento is going to put the rest of the teams to shame!!!@pocketjanitor @SacramentoKings Show me and I’ll find it!Dominant night for Domantas Sabonis  who puts up 30 points on 12/20 shooting (1/1 from 3, 5/7 FT) along with 20 rebounds, 5 assists, a steal, a block, and 4 turnovers in a loss to the Celtics @Dsabonis11 @SacramentoKings
