Don’t like betting my team but my @cavs are without Garland and LeVert tonight, and on road in Detroit.

With that being said CAVS struggle for points without Garland setting table.  Look for UNDER.

CAVS/Pistons UNDER 209 for 1 stack! 💵

Move Olynyk for prospect &amp; or a late 1st round pick!

Move CoJo for anything to get out from under his contract.

Cavs also missing their two guards in Garland &amp; Levert.@ProfessorCorria And I’m also crediting those Piston teams that fell a play or two short against those Celtics and Lakers squads.

Stop frontin'!2/24/88 – The Phoenix #Suns acquired rookie C Ron Moore (1.1p/.2r/.2a in 9 games) &amp; a 1991 2nd Rd pick (Richard Dumas) from the Detroit Pistons for James Edwards.

-No Garland, No LeVert for CLE.
-CLE will struggle to feed their bigs, and without Garland and LeVert it will be very hard for them to score.
-Pistons at home, and 7.5 is too many points for what should be a low scoring game.
