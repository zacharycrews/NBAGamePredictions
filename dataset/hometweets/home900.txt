 #ChicagoBulls #NBA@putemupcdukes @MikeBellATL @ATLHawks @DukesandBell929 We should've kept Cam.@clickpop2a @Tdude19 @putemupcdukes @ATLHawks @DukesandBell929 but if you think cam reddish has better defense than deandre hunter you’re crazy. that boy dre strong and fast enough that he can guard any position 😂@ATLHawks @BandmanMalachi2 @LeaderOfHorde This dude balled against the Bulls last night, only reason Hawks were in the game, until Demar took over.@clickpop2a @Tdude19 @putemupcdukes @ATLHawks @DukesandBell929 Huerter’s handle is shaky?? He is a liability on defense but nah, bro is a straight bucket with the ball in his hands. Cam shoots too much for someone whos not a great shooter therefor wasting a lot of the teams possessions.
