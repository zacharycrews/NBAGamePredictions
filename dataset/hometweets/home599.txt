It’s been ridiculous rnSimultaneously watching @KarlTowns win 💰on @WheelofFortune and dunk on the @HoustonRockets 🏀😂Ain't no D in Houston Rockets and boy, they are playing like itThe main issues any fan gon see with this @HoustonRockets team.

1. No defense
2. No rebounding (defensive and  offensive)
3. Chucking up random shots and missing.

We gotta do better!!!

@Kevinporterjr@HoustonRockets @kroger KPJ not starter@HoustonRockets What if we played defense 😭New #Rockets from Houston Chronicle — Rockets' defensive woes come from lack of recognition and experience, not effort https://t.co/OGfbIxmUZyNew #Rockets from Houston Chronicle — Rockets expect backcourt at full strength Monday against 76ers https://t.co/309X339SGxNew #Rockets from Houston Chronicle — Timberwolves’ Anthony Edwards brings encouraging precedent for Rockets’ Jalen Green https://t.co/MFRF0RkP5u@HoustonRockets Almost like Morant’s miss on KLove@HoustonRockets Would be down 21 instead of 23@HoustonRockets @kroger Yall suuuuuuuuckkk@HoustonRockets @kroger draft a defensive player@HoustonRockets @kroger Please fire Stephen Silas@HoustonRockets You can tell he really working on this shit here!! 🔥🔥🚀🚀@HoustonRockets Well done, he is the Future of the team..Cavs with 3 7 footers! Allen and Mobley gives you the 80s Houston Rockets feels with Olajuwon and Sampson! #NBA #NBA75#Rockets down 111-88 at the end of the third. Minnesota outscored Houston 36-34 in the quarter.

Good news: C-Wood much more aggressive, with 17 points in the quarter.

Bad news: KAT has a new season-high with 37 points.KJ Martin needs to be in the Dunk contest that is all that guy is special!! @HoustonRockets@HoustonRockets Literally just open my tweet and this is what I'm seeing 👀 , yeah... 24mins. left can they make a comeback?The Houston Rockets Trevor Ariza had a blind fold on during the game.I’m chilling in the top section but all the seats down low are empty. @HoustonRockets let me get some empty seats tickets@HoustonRockets @JalenGreen Amazing,  down almost 30.@HoustonRockets @JalenGreen How was that not a foul?@Stroshtx713 @HoustonRockets They do start down 20 every game.@YordongCockarez @HoustonRockets It is for us.@HoustonRockets Only 75 points allowed at the half ... Not bad!!!

I love the way this team plays defense!Houston Rockets using a Star Wars missile cam on the Jumbotron to fire lasers at Wolves fans in the building 🤣🤣The @HoustonRockets have the most unlikable roster in the nba.It's embarrassing how many dunks the Rockets have allowed to Vanderbilt tonight

Whether it's off a made basket, or in transition, he's getting these spoon-fed looks

Houston has been completely out of sorts https://t.co/dBBoJorKNI@ATTSportsNetSW @cayleighgriffin @HoustonRockets Imagine if they played D as well as they play 1 on 5…. #FireSilas@HoustonRockets Anyways… y’all ready to see Klay play tonight@HoustonRockets Wow.

Some way you have to get coach Sampson on this team. This is two years of the same with NO defensive improvement.#Rockets trail the Timberwolves 75-54 at the HALF

@cayleighgriffin with @HoustonRockets Assistant Coach John Lucas https://t.co/v6zG25BuqiWhen in the Space City, it only makes sense to go to a @HoustonRockets game 🚀

Also, fitting that it’s Star Wars Night ⭐️

#LightTheFuse https://t.co/iMo3CeCmlm@HoustonRockets In the last 4 games including this game the Rockets are giving up an average of 70 points in the 1st half. Im not necessarily saying the Rockets shouldnt keep tanking, but Id like to see some motivation and some direction in this team and I just dont see it at all.@HoustonRockets Get batter halftime show@HoustonRockets The Rockets should start the game down 20+ points, maybe we see some hustle.@HoustonRockets Giving up 70 in a half isn’t normal please find a new coach@__iamLondon @DaddyWarBuckz__ @HoustonRockets @ToyotaCenter lmao i could’ve had some little mock tails 😭😭@HoustonRockets @ToyotaCenter Concessions at games will sell the most putrid shit you have ever seen and people will still buy it cause it’s limited edition@HoustonRockets Trade Christian to the @celtics.@HoustonRockets For the love of God…play some “EFFIN” D!!!
