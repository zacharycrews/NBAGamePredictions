My accountant had to use some special capital gains assessment. The whole thing is crazy. This has never happened ever.@Raptors @TangerineHoops It is really a shame for the @Raptors to go the extra mile in OT to barely beat a stars-less @celtics.

Things will get ugly come playoff time if that win defines this team.@Stxrplayer @NAACPYOUNGBOY StarPlayer is hinting that if the stars align the LA Clippers basketball team could be in with a chance of facing the Boston Celtics in the NBA finals for the famous “Chip” otherwise known as championship.@mahergarrett13 @Ticketmaster @celtics I don’t blame you!@LyutsiferMatter //i used to get a lot of Boston Celtics basketball ads tbh i mess them@LegionHoops @ChrisBHaynes Kid has mad talent in a poorly run, coached and Lebron-managed organization.  @Celtics will take him.

Catch the full episode on YouTube or any podcast platform!! https://t.co/u6GeQbkb7R@Broncomaniac58 @celtics Came on so close to winning last night without 4 key players!! Hope we can beat the Heat tomorrow night!!@celtics @newbalance Although last night's loss is somewhat upsetting, the bench without 4 starters went until overtime. You remove turnovers, sloppy plays, missed layups and it would been a W. Encouraging. Goung to be great to have most starters back@davidwade @Ticketmaster @celtics They won't withhold any taxes. They just report their payments to you to the IRS.!!Jayson Tatum’s (Boston Celtics) vs Jimmy Butler’s (Miami Heat) Wednesd... https://t.co/a36JImx9dh via @YouTube@BroncoRob @celtics 🙏 I'm guessing they were resting them for the Miami game@adater @davidwade @Ticketmaster @celtics all part of the Dems wanting to crack down on Billionaires...and if you use Venmo or Zelle be ready to report you didn't make moneyThe strong relationships built between Ime Udoka, our assistants and our players has led to continuity on the court.

Or is the white/Kelly Green @dallasmavs Jersey way too @celtics@davidwade @Ticketmaster @celtics This, in the corporate world, is called "covering your ass." 

Since MA is a over $599.99 state, they need to issue a 1099K/Misc.@davidwade @Ticketmaster @celtics Well then, you won't have to pay any tax@billsperos @michaelFhurley @davidwade @Ticketmaster @celtics Thanks for the info!@adater @Ticketmaster @celtics I sold for less than face. No profit.@celtics Bet the Celtics will still win@davidwade @Ticketmaster @celtics If you made a profit, that’s income and needs to be reported. Rules since 1776 or so@davidwade @SteveHoffenberg @Ticketmaster @celtics They need your info. Otherwise, the IRS could after them for money laundering@MDDocB @michaelFhurley @davidwade @Ticketmaster @celtics the total is what had changed. used to be $20,000 for the year - now $600@jerrythornton1 It’s great. I did all of these things with my future husband. We both knew the same Monty Python routines. Both loved the Boston Celtics. I love his favorite movie (Casablanca). I hate golf but get why he loves it and let him play. Learned to love the Red Sox. Married 37 years!@davidwade @Ticketmaster @celtics It is happening to everyone

(New rules .... thanks, Brandon)

If total for year between you and any ticket seller goes  over $600 - they have to report to IRS

You get a 1099 and then have to report the income and offset costs (ticket prices) 

Also happening on payment apps@jmorse8236 @davidwade @Ticketmaster @celtics This is not sales tax, this is for income tax purposes for any profit made on the sale of the tickets. This is legit, but I would be cautious about sharing your social security number if it was not a secure link.@celtics Like to see it@lliwnoynek @celtics Haha yeah it was dopeThe Boston Celtics had one of the craziest mid-season turnarounds of all time and you can’t change my mind. https://t.co/ly1RlUIbik@davidwade @Ticketmaster @celtics Not surprised, now that Venmo and PayPal etc is taxable next step would be TicketmasterLast night, the @celtics came out fighting for every point, worked their butts off, all while  missing 4 of their starters.  In contrast, the @NHLBruins with a full compliment of starters, a chance to move up in the standings, come out playing like crap.  Who is more invested?@JOEYLEAFS93 @OpenGymAnunoby Looks like Boston is about to get Toronto'd two sports in a row. #LeafsForever #WeTheNorth Siera has a famous line for the Boston Celtics.Toronto, Canada — Pascal Siakam poured in 40 points as the Toronto Raptors snapped the Boston Celtics’ six-game win streak with a 115-112 overtime victory on Monday.

They report the ultimate gross costs to the seller including both pre-Ticketmaster’s commission cost AND the additional fees the buyer pays that goes into Ticketmaster’s pocket. You get hit with it all. 

Have fun!@lliwnoynek @celtics Right? I was like Why is the Jet Blue plane Green?! Being I’ve been a Celtics fan my whole life I thought it was pretty dope. However, the Celtics had never flown on that plane 😂@davidwade @Ticketmaster @celtics Mayor Wu @wutrain would characterize this problem as white.Hey @celtics Are You Ready for #Web3?

Frustrating to say the least!!!@guertin_mike @NESN @NHLBruins @celtics They've had issues with the cameras being funky all year, too. Skipping, distorting, anything but showing the product. Someone needs to say something to the Sox at some point@davidwade @Ticketmaster @celtics Thing to watch out for is the 1099K you get will report the entire amount as though it was all taxable "income." When you file your taxes next year you may need to file another form factoring in your ticket cost to declare what portion of the $ was taxable profit.@davidwade @Ticketmaster @celtics I would call them directly before replying to that email to make sure it’s legitIs anyone else having freezing issues on @NESN ?? It’s so annoying!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Wish the @NHLBruins would leave Nesn and broadcast on a real network like the @celtics
