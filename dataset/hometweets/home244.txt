Pick: Minnesota Timberwolves -2.5 (-110) 5u

This team might be finding their groove after winning 2 straight. Grizzlies are always a team that wins one, loses one, all season, so expect them to drop one after winning 2 straight themselves.While we watch the Rockets flounder, here’s the rest of the NBA for today…

Oklahoma City Thunder 1Q +3.5
Atlanta Hawks -7.5
Minnesota Timberwolves 1Q -1
Minnesota Timberwolves -2.5
Magic/Bucks under 215

#Betting #FreePicks https://t.co/0nBC19D87UThe Minnesota Timberwolves need to trade D’Angelo Russell for John WallThe Minnesota Timberwolves had the Phoenix Suns on their heels too. They're not so far ahead.Every single player that leaves the Minnesota Timberwolves does better for themselves. 

KG left minny and got a ring, Butler left Minny and got to the Finals.

There's one common denominator here https://t.co/FTOTQu9D4M@StoolGreenie 5 rings belongs to the Minnesota TimberwolvesMost PTS during 1 Postseason GP in Minnesota #Timberwolves history:
