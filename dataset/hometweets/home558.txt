- why my wife is a Saint https://t.co/aS9w0SqGdh@tdgarden @celtics I don’t think i’m reading this wrong, but from 1/15 to 2/14, you no longer have to be fully vaccinated for entry. Just need one dose, which you could get in line at TD.

Seems like TD is doing this to mirror the city’s forthcoming mandate - which is fine, but also pretty silly.@Home_Brodie @celtics well, they do work in a way, but Grant's ability to shoot the three at a high rate overweighs whatever Al does there. No disrespect to Al, but Grant should start of his place for that simple fact@Becoming_Bryna @celtics Man..that's a cool pic..thankyou..@lllLockzzlll @lnternaIz @celtics also no need for that, since ratio is just a poor attempt of asking the people to give you likes in order to get more likes than the comment you replied to. Grow up. No opinions changed and it looks dumb af. Ratio my buttcheeks, kiddo@BrotherAndrej @celtics common sense imo😤…Grant is our best shooter and the double big lineup obviously isn’t working🤦‍♂️Boston Celtics News - @celtics starting 5⃣ for tonight's game with the San Antonio Spurs. #bostonceltics #celtics #bostonathlete #boston #basketball #NBA #NBA75 #BleedGreen #goceltics #bostonathletemagazine https://t.co/1v3msNGkkxI’ll be watching the @Celtics tonight.

Postponed game
Northeastern (6-7) vs UNC Wilmington (7-5)

Hit up a few NBA games each season and tonight's postponement gives me a chance to hop over to the TD Garden and cheer for my late father's favorite team. https://t.co/sT1bGPILKl@Home_Brodie @celtics glad I'm not alone with that one@celtics Why Tatum😩@celtics as excited as I am to have the starting five back, I'd rather see Grant start instead of Horford, because Grant works as a spot up shooter.
it will be interesintg to see how the bench performs. Core is fine, the bench needs to start performing consistently@lllLockzzlll @celtics Also tonight I f y mhttps://t.co/3r5u5YooVn @celtics starting lineup!@celtics Smart gotta go! JT &amp; JB won’t ever fully have the keys to the LAMBO til Smart is gone.

+7.5 has 78 % MONEY %

I'd be happy with getting two seconds or a late first out of Dennis.@milkviaoreo @Hawksgoated @gReenbean_26 @celtics Agreed, I think my first trade proposal was a little lightTonight at 7:30pm, the @celtics take on the #Spurs, #BleedGreen @tdgarden @TheSportsMuseum #mylocalMA https://t.co/XkVjyFX2bO@TheAthleticNBA @sam_amick @celtics @BCCoachStevens let’s do thisHey @Celtics, #LetsTank. 

Don’t overthink it!

Get under the cap, play the young guys, get a high draft pick and make a trade in the summer.

It’s the best strategy available.

@KeithSmithNBA @SeanGrandePBP @John_Karalis @dangercart https://t.co/ELkaAaOs1f@celtics This team can be fixed! Front offices always defer to the future to save themselves. We had better not start parting out guys to shed $. Make the team better so when the playoffs start we have a chance. All of Danny's capital has not paid off and now he's gone. Thank you Celtics!@celtics Let's say Schroeder is your 1, Tatum 2, Sabonis 4 and Timelord 5. We need a 3. If Tatum is your 3 then we need a pure 2. Schroeder &amp; Timelord could be upgraded but would suffice. There's always deals to be made but you have to see it. You gotta be willing to move guys out.@Hawksgoated @TatumsMVP @gReenbean_26 @celtics Give us Clint and trae and we’ll consider it.Aye @celtics FREE JAYSON TATUM. Right now. He deserves better than this poverty franchise.@celtics You see how competitive we are when only 1 of Tatum &amp; Brown is out on a given night. They are similar players. If you trade 1 you can fix the team. It just makes sense. Brown for Sabonis and a second trade to define your 2/3 situation.

Obviously he’s not as good now as he used to be. So I’m not saying Ole boys argument is correct just saying he is a potential hall of famer.@JT_Richards @Big5blue @HonestLarry1 @GerryCallahan @celtics @Lakers The greatest team champion ever.@NoahWilsonRich @BestBees @celtics @Vistaprint Love those shirts!@RedSoxHRCart @steven05taylor @BrownOfJaylen @NBAGooni @celtics Al is a 5 time All-Star and a national champion. Do I think he’ll get in? No but he’s borderline.@steven05taylor @RedSoxHRCart @BrownOfJaylen @NBAGooni @celtics Do the Celtics not have All-Star caliber guys? JT and JB along with a borderline hall of Famer in Horford. This team should be better and to me you can blame the coach and the star player@celtics @NBA @jaytatum0 @FCHWPO I have zero interest in the scoring of any single player. What matters is whether we won.@RedSoxHRCart @ArtCovUnion247 @BrownOfJaylen @NBAGooni @celtics because he has no answer. you don’t win without superteams unless the superteam gets hurt or have epic collapses, been that way since the miami big 3. spurs, mavs, raptors, bucks are the only exception in 12 years and all of them had very good teams and/or all star caliber guys.@ArtCovUnion247 @BrownOfJaylen @steven05taylor @NBAGooni @celtics Fair@RedSoxHRCart @BrownOfJaylen @steven05taylor @NBAGooni @celtics You offended me by insulting my verbiage so I gave you reasoning behind it.@frostybias @NBACobwebs @mikewichter Does Paul pierce getting carried/carted off the Boston Celtics Court being injured count as a bizarre injury because supposedly he actually crapped on himself? https://t.co/riHi4sdByB@celtics Would be nice if he could play more than two week stints. Can’t help if he’s not on the floor@23JAM_23 @Big5blue @HonestLarry1 @GerryCallahan @celtics @Lakers I was responding to, "Ya...but mostly because we have Russell". No one comes close to Russell when it comes to winning, and winning games and championships is the point.@ArtCovUnion247 @BrownOfJaylen @steven05taylor @NBAGooni @celtics You only answered the part that did not matter@ArtCovUnion247 @BrownOfJaylen @NBAGooni @celtics What happened in his first year with the Lakers? Didn't make playoffs. He's always had good players around him. LeBron has had Kyrie, Bosh, Wade, Ray Allen, Kevin Love basically in his prime, Tristan Thompson in his prime, so many good players around him.@RedSoxHRCart @BrownOfJaylen @steven05taylor @NBAGooni @celtics Well the word is Championship so it’s pretty stupid when people use ‘Chip’@ArtCovUnion247 @BrownOfJaylen @steven05taylor @NBAGooni @celtics Does he really need to make the ALL STAR team? He averaged 20 and shot almost 50/40/90 which is pretty damn hard to do. Also who calls it the "ship"@RedSoxHRCart @BrownOfJaylen @NBAGooni @celtics Lebron has done it essentially his entire career outside of this season. I hate Lebron but he’s gotten his team there his entire career regardless of rosterSam Jones (1933–2021), Boston Celtics legend

https://t.co/LYpMPsLqY2@ArtCovUnion247 @BrownOfJaylen @NBAGooni @celtics LeBron can't even get to the 5th seed with 3 stars on their team... you can't say a team of Brodric Thomas and 1 Giannis guarentees a 3 seed. Stars need role players around them... do you watch sports?@steven05taylor @BrownOfJaylen @NBAGooni @celtics Yes you’re right I don’t like Marcus Smart he is extremely overpaid for his production. He will be traded mark my words@ArtCovUnion247 @BrownOfJaylen @NBAGooni @celtics it’s no way you could actually watch the bucks play and say jrue holiday is out of his prime, so you must be talking about his stats. i used some to show you how good he’s been bc the numbers don’t him justice in many areas. i’m sure you’re one of those guys that don’t like smartJo-Jo White was a 2x NBA Champion, both with the Boston Celtics, also a member of the basketball Hall of Fame as of 2015.

https://t.co/i0d9Ihie78@ArtCovUnion247 @BrownOfJaylen @NBAGooni @celtics shot the best field goal and 3 point % of his career, only 3 less points than his career high average with 2 other 20ppg scorers. on top of that still 1st team all defense. his best year average wise was not even his all star year. watch games not stats.
