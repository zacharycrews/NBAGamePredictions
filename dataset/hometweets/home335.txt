The Brooklyn Nets? Yeah I sure hope there are nets on the hoops. https://t.co/GqTGkoL8l2The Brooklyn Nets being 7th (106.5) in defensive rating with one of their best defenders (Nicolas Claxton) only playing 4 games and being 13th on the team in minutes (76) is noteworthy

Via Basketball Reference@BrooklynNets Bruce and Clax off the bench for defense 🙏🏾Back in Brooklyn as the Nets play game 1 of B2B tonight at 7:30 against the Minnesota Timberwolves who are w/out KAT. 

#Timberwolves are 11-11 on the year, but 7-3 over last 10.

Cherry picking😂@CurryMV3 @BrooklynNets @KDTrey5 Apparently your information is outdated. KD is being praised almost as equal as Steph for MVP. Considering the numerous KD lovers  between voters, I won’t be surprised if they give it to him.Hot take:

Nets throwbacks are great — as many of the alternate jerseys have been in recent years — but they overwear them.

The traditional black ‘Brooklyn’ jersey is still my favorite. Biased towards the black &amp; white sleek color scheme.ITS GAMEDAY

#arbitrage #bettingtwitter #bettingpicks #sportsbets #freepicks #freemoney #mlbThe line tonight on TWolves vs Nets is -8 Brooklyn.

I don’t see it. In fact The TWolves are primed and have the personnel to beat The Nets.

This is a game where DLo will be motivated, There’s no defense for KAT, Edwards is a phenom and Beverly will pester Harden.

TWolves by 3.@DakCPOTYszn @statmuse @KDTrey5 @BrooklynNets @KingJames LmAoo chill they gon use he not as big as them  “he’s just lanky” 😂😂Lol stop it @BrooklynNets https://t.co/rqIWSjANli@constantstateo4 @Bronstan2 @NJKidV2 @statmuse @KDTrey5 @BrooklynNets @KingJames That’s a fact there too@statmuse @KDTrey5 @BrooklynNets @KingJames “He would join Lebron (2x)”@BrooklynNets It’s gonna be a solid game.21:30 – Philadelphia 76ers x Atlanta Hawks

Best record in the West, which they said it’s much tougher than East that Giannis and Bucks only won 2 more games. Also LeBron did it at age 35-36, which was insane.@CurryMV3 @BrooklynNets @KDTrey5 4 more points on 10% less FG%. That 10% is huge.@BrooklynNets @KDTrey5 Kai liked @vicecity4life 👀@CurryMV3 @BrooklynNets @KDTrey5 The main problem is that they change the narrative every time. When LeBron has the best team record, they say he played with AD, while now they say KD is an MVP front runner (doesn’t he play with Harden). LeBron plays all 82 games and carries his team, they make other excuses.@CurryMV3 @BrooklynNets @KDTrey5 LeBron should have won way more my man. 2006 over Steve Nash. 2011 as you said over Rose. 2018 when Harden won it with 0.45 FG vs LBJ’s 0.54 and all other superior stats. 16-17, crazy LBJ wasn’t even top 3 in voting.

🎥 @BrooklynNets https://t.co/wq5kcvXrsb@CurryMV3 @BrooklynNets @KDTrey5 And yet LeBron won only 4 MVPs. Biased voters never wanted him get more mvps. Otherwise how could he be the best player of the months that many times and win only 4 mvps?@brooklynnets85 @brooklynsbeat you should add that to your facts when speaking about @KyrieIrving.
