5. Watch the video! They did listen. Chris Russell, Rick Snider said it wasn’t going to happen. Minnesota Timberwolves blocked the WFT from the name. Name was issue from the startMatch: Minnesota Timberwolves - Oklahoma City Thunder

Had been reported for a while that Minnesota Timberwolves had been blocking anything Wolf related. Happy to see that option officially gone.NBA Basketball Game Betting Picks Simulator: 1/5/2022 8:00 PM ET - Oklahoma City Thunder vs. Minnesota Timberwolves - YOU CAN RUN THE GAME SIMULATION FOR FREE HERE: https://t.co/o0cMYfy05T #nba #sportsbetting #freepicks #cappertek@VaRedWolves @whoisjwright @WashingtonNFL They didn’t try for Redwolves or Wolves. If they really wanted they’d have it. You mean the Minnesota Timberwolves can block a team in a different league, city, and sport from having any incarnation of a wolf??? Ridiculous.@WASFan86 @Abarmier @rbrat10 They didn’t try hard enough and commander’s have trademark issues as well.  Also I bet next week someone will come out from the Minnesota Timberwolves and say we never tried to get that name watch!Congratulations to Flowersunny who moved up 101 spots to take #24 on the Minnesota Timberwolves team leaderboard.

https://t.co/f3SMKbNQUmYou’re telling me that you can have the SF Giants and the NY Giants, but you can’t have the the Minnesota Timberwolves and the Washington Wolves? #Wrighttttttt https://t.co/YOUDHk3dav@ChadwikoTWW Also, he’d be having to deal with the Minnesota Timberwolves and new owner Alex Rodriguez, who’s gone from disgraced MLB star to Shark Tank entrepreneur, MLB national color commentator and NBA owner. He’s somehow untouchable, lol@jsquared021 @DBirdHoops I get you're pumped about your upcoming wild card loss and everything but the Washington Team President released like a 7 min video just to say Redwolves can't be the name because the Minnesota Timberwolves won't relinquish any of the trademarks they own 😂😂3 ideal Cam Reddish trade scenarios ahead of NBA deadline https://t.co/4cUAUc3dI3 #NBA #AtlantaHawks #MinnesotaTimberwolves@Snide_Remarks So we can’t be the “Redwolves” because of the Minnesota Timberwolves? Cmon Rick this is not true and this issue is solvable. There are hundreds of overlapping sporting team names that can legally co-exist. eg NY Giants and SF Giants, LA Kings and Sacramento Kings
