TS:  Phenny https://t.co/1RunyfZ764@SarahKezele Neither…. I think they are trying to make sure the MVP is from outside of the US and discounting our local US Phoenix Suns talent@NBATV @memgrizz @MiamiHEAT @Suns I believe nobody has expected the miami heat to be at 1st seed and the memphis at 2nd seed at the beginning of the season. So it's either Coach Erik or share the award with Jenkins.@Suns Cam won't win but Mikal has a great chanceIt’s almost time!!! Let’s go @Suns #NBAPlayoffs2022 https://t.co/wk02FMjpdu✨BIG MOOD✨ @Suns

Especially in Game 1.@Suns_Armband He had a career performance last night .

https://t.co/r7xzzbH1Ab

#NBAPlayoffs #RallyTheValley #Suns #PhoenixThe Phoenix Suns would have not beat the clippers, this is unfortunately for the fans. The pelicans have no chance.Best of 7 means best of 7.

That's why @Suns don't have a trophy for winning the first 2 Finals games last year. That's why Steph and the @warriors didn't finish their 73 win season and the Lebron led @cavs finally got theirs. It's why @russwest44 and @KDTrey5 broke up.

Go Suns https://t.co/cNYnKtOxp0@RSaenzFox10 @FOX10Phoenix @Suns The “key” is TEAM. When each man plays his role, they usually win. Not just the starting 5 playing their role, the entire bench!

Conf Finals will be Golden State losing to Phoenix in the West, Philadelphia losing to Boston in the East.The @warriors are my NBA team. But the @miamiheat style of bball and @Suns are both appealing.@its_khaleel @Suns @PelicansNBA Pelicans will be tougher for Phoenix than Utah/Dallas. They know our schemes, have the personal to exploit mismatches, and will be playing without any pressure. Dangerous.

Let’s go @suns.@LakeShowYo I had @Suns vs @BrooklynNets@KingJames 🏀 @Rachel__Nichols Get healthy, I hope you make the right decision. I like @Suns in this one. #NBA🏀Phoenix -10.5 (-110)

In the 4 games NO and PHO have played this year, the Suns are 3-1 ATS and straight up, winning by 16, 13, and 12. 

With the Pelicans already playing 2 play in games, I expect PHO to get off to a fast start and stay up the whole game. 

#bettingtwitterHow the Phoenix Suns built a championship brand—off the court https://t.co/Ce4jtZgayI@PhoenixMercury @Suns I respect the men of the Phoenix Sun They show up to the WNBA ( Phoenix Mercury) games. Much respect for them. wishing them the best on the playoffs.The Phoenix Suns will play the Miami heat in the final. Chris Paul gets his first chip in 6 games.

But I don't get the certainly with which NBA analysts think the Suns will sweep.  I would be shocked if the Pels do not win a game.The 2022 NBA Playoffs bracket is now set! Will it be Milwaukee Bucks vs Phoenix Suns on the finals again?
