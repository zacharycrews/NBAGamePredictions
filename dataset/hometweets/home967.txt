they also made a set based off of the blue/pink Miami heat gear and I wanted to make that for the whole vaporwave gimmick I was rocking at the time.

His assists during the nets game shifted the momentum for us to gain the lead. If the bench is playing well, why does need to@MiamiHEAT @raf_tyler @BioSteelSports Better than Poole😹@missysinghsongs @MiamiHEAT Isiaah don't play D 😅Speak The Truth: Victor Oladipo https://t.co/Rb9KLVexkl via @MiamiHEAT   The world needs more people like this young man.@Jumpshot8 @BrooklynNets @Lakers ask the gm got you from the miami heat. lol@charlyjuanka @MiamiHEAT I NEED THIS WALLPAPER@Roke4ali @TermineRadio @MiamiHEAT Yea, they unlocked the formula for beating the Suns. Just make 22 3s every game. It’s sustainable for sure.@tj1k5 @MiamiHEAT @D_Bo20 My bad elite sniper @D_Bo20 just trying to hype up Oladipo and show his talents 😂East-leading Heat could get Victor Oladipo back vs. Rockets  #NBA

https://t.co/6D0rlSWWGg@MiamiHEAT @D_Bo20 Congratulations 🎈🎊🎉🍾Balling by the beach, like Miami Heat....didnt yall lose by 23 to the @MiamiHEAT whole backup roster except kyle lowry? https://t.co/EptGpCY1V2@MiamiHeatTheory @MiamiHEAT @D_Bo20 Ngl i watched this but wtf this got to do with this 🤣😭@statmuse The NBA is so much more talented now in comparison to 2010-2011 range. If you dropped that year’s Miami Heat into this years league, people wouldn’t even bat an eye. They would just be another good to great team. Back in 10-11, the entire media and fan landscape freaked out.@lifer_305 @MiamiHEAT We didn’t have to know that bro but LFG!!!TODAY IS THE DAY FOLKS. OLADIPO WILL PLAY HIS 5TH GAME IN A MIAMI HEAT JERSEY AND MAKE HIS 2021-2022 SEASON DEBUT. HE WILL JOIN AN ALREADY ELITE TEAM AND HAVE THIS TEAM WILL NOW HAVE A BENCH(!!!!!!!) BACKCOURT OF OLADIPO AND A VERY MUCH IMPROVED TYLER HERRO. https://t.co/LHhhMGp6IeThe REAL REASON The Miami Heat Are OVERWHELMING https://t.co/UgvC68Y14TDipo Day is *finally* here!! 

"if Miami gets even a 75-ish percent of the 2017-18 version of Oladipo, it’s a huge bonus for an already-deep Heat squad that might push them over the top in a seven-game series..."

@hothothoops #HEATCulture 

https://t.co/VxReiPHC7oIf the heat win tmr and the warriors lose, Miami would have the 2nd best record in the nba behind only the suns 😎@rexpostfacto Only one NBA player on a roster right now that's older than me is the Miami Heat mascot Udonis Haslem. 😬😬That is why we need to say it like this.  "TYLER HEERRROOOOOOOOO!!"  I've been saying it loudly like this since his UK Wildcats Days!  Say it with emphasis like tou are saying. OOOHHHHHHHHHH

I'm completely in awe. Whatever may be..and I THINK it's gonna be great! This Miami Heat fan is seriously priveledged to witness. Thanks all u guys.❤🖤@mikamclaren @tennistaboo :((( he just posted on his Instagram stories. Court conditions -given the difference of weather in the California desert/Miami heat might hinder his wrist given how the ball plays@prembry I just know Jimmy Butler’s Miami Heat eliminated the Celtics in 2020, and they’re the number 1 seed currently. What exactly do you have to gloat about?  Lol you’re the 5th seed that’s gonna be fighting for your life to not play the Bucks in the first round GGWhen NBA writers/bloggers/ex players discuss the Heat, it’s perfectly fair to predict playoffs doom 

But to be this willfully ignorant, it’s lazy and dumb, 🤡 stuff 

Funny thing is, not only did Miami beat suns w/o best 2 players, they beat this same bucks team w/on them, also https://t.co/Yv587BRsb0@HeLuvsViolet @MiamiHEAT I love the heatCheck out this listing I just found on #Poshmark: Miami heat “Wade Jersey”. https://t.co/YR7Mu81MP1 #shopmycloset @poshmarkapp@HeLuvsViolet @MiamiHEAT niceSlogan i thought of for @MiamiHEAT You cant BEAT the HEAT@_ilcaponero @MiamiHEAT A lot of the popular restaurants are Asian ones 😁This is like making me choose between Bron or the Miami heat 🥲 https://t.co/w37RTITXFUNBA Basketball Game Betting Picks Simulator: 3/7/2022 7:40 PM ET - Houston Rockets vs. Miami Heat - YOU CAN RUN THE GAME SIMULATION FOR FREE HERE: https://t.co/59zWtbWs7o #nba #sportsbetting #freepicks #cappertek@adport23 @TermineRadio Miami Heat is part of FIFA now.

He didn't write "anyone in the West". As soon as he stated "League" then Miami Heat must be involved... by 23 minus 2 (if you know what I mean).@ToneRah305 @MiamiHEAT He’s scored more on one 10 day contract than Marqueef has in one year, bruh.WATCH: LeBron James Gets Intoxicated With Miami Heat Friend Dwyane Wade in Wild Birthday Party - EssentiallySports https://t.co/bChGjPovfI@TermineRadio Didn’t the @MiamiHEAT beat the Suns by 23 without Bam and jimmy? 🤡 showMiami Heat really could end up with Coach of the year, 6MOTY, &amp; DPOY.Victor Oladipo will make his season debut for the #MiamiHeat tomorrow night. After two surgeries on his leg it’s hard to say what he’ll end up being. I know this much though, the Heat are a very good team without him and risk chemistry by throwing VO into the lineup now….Everyone talking about @sixers while the @MiamiHEAT quietly beat them as they continue to sit on top of the East. @JimmyButler let @iamjamiefoxx play tonight!Watching other teams really struggle when they lose a starter or two makes me really appreciate the fact the Heat blast the Suns with Lowry, Herro and the bench, or the way they can go 3-1 vs the top teams in the East w/o Lowry. 

Miami’s depth is ridiculous.@Drew28557163 @OAnunoby @MiamiHEAT Of all teams ugh lolI know it’s trendy to say #Nets lose Becuase they and fans got cocky, but the 2010 Miami Heat counted to 7 titles at a welcome party before playing a game.

Love to see it!I love @OAnunoby but he is always hurt. The fact we don’t have an actual point guard right now. And ZERO SHOOTING! Ya this experiment is a fail! We lost the games we should of won and now we have a hard schedule!

Bye 👋 https://t.co/zGfr6dapXl@JonGardens4000 @MiamiHEAT @D_Bo20 You thought you were smart writing this didn't you?

Learn Win Shares is how you see who is impacting winning

Eliminate career length/MP bias by using WS/48. Then you can look at O/D

What if I told you when considering winning impact Herro matters the least?

It's simple math https://t.co/bVLKfsUuC4The NBA is fucking rigged it took the referees to help the Bucks to win against the Phoenix Suns and 29 FTs and the Phoenix Suns only 10 the same referees on the Miami Heat game against the Bucks#PHXvsMIL@Giavotella_170 @corneil46304300 @MiamiHEAT Umm ya it's way different. 

Kyrie sat because he's a conspiracy nut and a baby. 

Lowry has a long career as the top character guy on the Raptors. He never took time off and played through injuries. If you're questioning his heart, u don't know Lowry.The #MiamiHeat are listing Victor Oladipo as questionable for their Monday night game against the Houston Rockets. Officially, that means there’s a 50-50 chance of the two-time All-Star playing for the first time in nearly a year. https://t.co/CBqANGLalj@Jumpshot8 @HugOfThunder @Suns @NBA Kehinde Babatunde Victor Oladipo (born May 4, 1992) is an American professional basketball player for the Miami Heat. Oladipo was drafted with the second overall pick in the 2013 NBA draft by the Orlando Magic and went on to be named to the NBA All-Rookie first team.@Z3than @malika_andrews I’m a fan of all California teams bc that’s where I’m from so warriors Lakers Dodgers giants rams etc + heat (Miami connection) &amp; sixers (Philly connection) + im also trying to get into hockey so I’m a lightning fan@Herro4three Don’t matter either way @MiamiHEAT are deep as hell!@CR7HATRICK @dbu31 @JoeHinds35 @nathanmarzion Beat the heat by 1 without Kyle Lowry? And it took the ultimate choke job by Miami. Don’t know how high I’d be.

Would want to share my birthday with my fellow @MiamiHEAT #HeatNation #HEATCulture especially The Pool Party Crew! #birthday #34 https://t.co/6ugoUatAUN@nbarealist23 The expansion era talk is ridiculous. Expansion has always happened- 2 teams added in the 90s. From 88, the Hornets, T wolves, Magic and Heat all became repeated playoff teams with Miami and Orlando becoming championship contenders 

Lebron played in the tanking era@iBaz66 @MiamiHEAT Got excited at first glance thinking you finally took delivery of the m4… 😞Tomorrow we start off a new week, the @MiamiHEAT are still #1 in the, plus the Phins are honing in on the NFL Draft

https://t.co/YMl7dmPRlxThere’s an argument to be made that the #Heat and #Celtics are the two toughest teams in the East. 

Miami is deep, versatile, mentally tough, with the best coach in the NBA.

Celtics have two stars in Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown and they’ve been great defensively@HKhan2K Facts even if it was Miami Heat Shaq
