There are a multitude of teams that haven’t done shit in 40+ years. I agree Charlotte is near the bottom though.

the honeycomb gradient looks better on a starter jacket than a jersey imo. props to the hornets for trying but this is over the top for a team with a color scheme as great as charlotte’s.

p.s. i would’ve used the old hornets or bobcats number font instead. https://t.co/B8iHuu3ggU@Ansonikage Well now I feel old when you put it like that.
