Enough with the 3 ball.Not gone fake @utahjazz YALL need to step right fucking now.A huge third quarter from the @timberwolves turns a a @utahjazz 13 point lead into a one point deficit heading into the fourth.

#GamblingTwitter https://t.co/8ct8pZPiR6@tiffanee_dawn @utahjazz @vivintarena Perfect way to celebrate !the @utahjazz have mastered the art of flopping as a team… I haven’t seen a team have so many weak hoopers on a team in my life… whole team can’t play through any contact without flopping and @rudygobert27 the weakest big man I ever seen! gets bailed out with his length…Halftime for @Timberwolves vs @utahjazz:

Greg Monroe-
9 MIN, 2 PTS, 3 REB (2 ORB), 1 AST

Foul fest so far as the Timberwolves are in the penalty for the rest of the quarter.
