- @KennethDay12, @warriors@zgayer @warriors GOALS! Keep crushing it 👊@zgayer @GSWReddit @warriors Most influential sports team of the decade, maybe only Barcelona and Real Madrid during the Messi v Ronaldo rivalry came close but they have been outclassed by now. Joe Lacob hit several home-runs on and off the field, ultimately Steph Curry made them big tho, he is one of a kind“…There’s a real world in which the @warriors could win the championship with Wiseman sitting on the bench for the entirety of the playoffs. That right there is a good an indication as any of how well this team is going”.

More on James Wiseman:

https://t.co/KzE3iGxt6Z@NBATV @Kia @warriors MVP is Luka! Mavs we’re 9-4! He gets hurt they lose 3 in a row and he come back and they beat clippers! Plus he’s averaging 25, 8, and 8!Cmon man golden state fans got some damn nerve coming at lebron celebrations. I know I’m late but warriors fans still quote tweeting about Lbj celebration… look at this bullshit. Look like when the Monstars were taking player’s talent and shit
