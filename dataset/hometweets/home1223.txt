Pat Bev has been really the battery and the engine that they needed."@hooperbole Sam Cassell in 2004, because the Minnesota Timberwolves were Finals-bound until he got hurt in WCF Game 2 against the Lakers. He stays 100%, Wolves cruise. Still took LAL to 6 games in that seriesThe Western Conference Play-In Tournament is set:

(8) Los Angeles Clippers @ (7) Minnesota Timberwolves - April 12, TBD time - TNT

(10) San Antonio Spurs @ (9) New Orleans Pelicans - April 13, 9:30pm ET - ESPNChris Finch is the Head Coach of the Minnesota @Timberwolves üê∫! He‚Äôs extremely undervalued &amp; unappreciated it‚Äôs actually pathetic. The jump this team made just from last season is a testament to his coaching style &amp; the culture he‚Äôs instilled in this locker room! #WolvesI am hoping for a Memphis Grizzlies vs Minnesota Timberwolves playoff matchup so bad. Both teams talk the most in the league and they are 2-2 against each other. It would be must-see television.
