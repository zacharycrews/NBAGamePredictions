Brooklyn Nets VS Milwaukee Bucks

02/26/22@travischlepp @Bucks Oh wow@Mxstre @Bucks @Giannis_An34 I would like george back, but he has been injured for a while and if it became a long term injury kinda like brook lopez then we should consider letting him go.Let’s go @Bucks!!!! #FearTheDeer https://t.co/1kzXhx2HwuCaught up with @espn analyst @JalenRose and asked him about tonight's matchup against the @BrooklynNets, the tight race in the East and if he thinks the @Bucks can repeat as @NBA Champions. https://t.co/EmEGSOzy0zMilwaukee Bucks Starters:

#FearTheDeer #NBA #NBATwitter #NBA75@bucks__stan @Bucks @Giannis_An34 Jevon Carter has been playing like shit, I'd rather have a 36 year old George Hill that can hit open 3s and play-make running the back up PG than Jevon Carter who idk how he will fit with the bucks but nets fans were always saying he was absolutely garbage so...It would be a wonderful show of solidarity with #Ukraine if the @Bucks would add its national anthem to pre-game for all remaining home games.  @Giannis_An34  @CharlesPPierce@KimJonesSports @WFAN660 @BrooklynNets @Bucks You are the bomb Kim!🏀 NBA Play

But me too. The throwbacks are so sick!The Nets should have 2-3 of Kyrie Irving, Seth Curry, Goran Dragic, Patty Mills, and Cam Thomas on the floor at just about all times tonight against Milwaukee.

Shot making will be how Brooklyn competes against the Bucks tonight. That’s a good amount of backcourt creativity.@Double_HTown @Bucks That first one looks similar to a few Bucks concepts I have made. Love that green rainbow on the side.

Giannis revived an absolute disaster and made this team relevant after a long drought. Kareem was so dominant, I get it, but I don’t think Giannis needs another chip. He’s locked up under contract through age 31 or so.Yo people are acting like the Milwaukee Bucks ain't win the east last year and completed it with the NBA championship. Don't forget people. They still the Champs until they lose.@trombear1 @Bucks At least another chip. Prime Kareem was THAT good.@sweatboxprogram @Bucks You think he needs to stay his whole career and get another chip to match Kareem’s time with the Bucks?@trombear1 @Bucks Too early to crown Giannis.

Bucks went down 0-2 in finals too and what happened. Don’t count the bucks out or you will learn the same lesson again. No way Nets would have won in 5. That’s nonsense@Bucks So good to see him. That's the most hair I've seen on the guy but I'm glad he's feeling better.The Milwaukee Bucks play host to the Brooklyn Nets in a rematch of last season’s seven-game Eastern Conference semifinals matchup.
