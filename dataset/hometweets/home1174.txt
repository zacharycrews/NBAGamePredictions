Really an interesting matchup.Happy Kyle Lowry Day! Big night ahead for the #GROAT s first appearance back in Toronto since the trade. 🥲 @Raptors @Klow7 @TheJurassicPack https://t.co/B58XzLqtd3@JayFresh704 @Jdcostin910 Raptors were founded in 1994. UNC and Duke history runs way deeper than the Raptors too. They still have a championship and many playoff births. No excuses for the Hornets. If Toronto can do it, Charlotte can too.Unfortunately, only got 5 followers so smh. I hate betting basketball but have to bet this

The Heat (108.7 DRTG, 95.8 Pace) and Raptors (110.3 DRTG, 95.9 Pace) are among the top-10 in the league for defensive rating and are in the bottom-five for pace, so it should be a low-scoring slugfest tonight.Happy Kyle Lowry Day, Toronto. 🏀❤️

With a W. #7DaysofGiveaways @TangerineHoopsToronto Raptors Welcome Back Kyle and is Heat Tonight@Klow7 Standing O will be crazy!!!
But also looking forward to @Raptors winning!!! https://t.co/K1GOl9W20ORaptors magic number over the Cavs is 3 

If the Cavs were healthy catching the Raps could be possible, Cavs go 3-1 or 4-0 and hope Toronto goes 1-4 or 2-3, but all of that feels unlikely right nowExcited to be going to the @Raptors game tonight. I’m already emotional 😂😭. Can’t wait to see @Klow7 back in the building ❤️ #WeTheNorth@TangerineHoops @Raptors #7DaysofGiveaways Raptors will score 104 pts tonight.@TangerineHoops @Raptors 106 point!! #7DaysofGiveaways@jamiecam43 @prembry @m_shantz @Raptors I never once said that Precious is better than Bam. I said he has potential. If he does the work (and he appears to be doing so) he can be GREAT. Moreover, I argued that I trust @Raptor development to get the job done as they have proven their competence, many times over.@BradUrbanaowicz Strange hate tweet. As a color man, he's actually really pretty witty and smart, and well regarded everywhere.

But you're just a typical Toronto Leaf hate fan type. Why I'm no longer a Leaf's fan, as it's so embarrassing to go to games. And such a huge Raptors and Jay's fan now.@TangerineHoops @Raptors #7DaysofGiveaways Raptors scoring 112 tonight 🔥🔥@jamiecam43 @prembry @m_shantz @Raptors No. That is NOT what I said. I said that Precious has the ability with proper development to exceed the accomplishments of Bam because the modern NBA is a shooters league. Bigs that can spread the floor are prized over bigs that cannot. And that is a FACT. Advantage: Precious.Proper loving the Kyle Lowry love on the Raptors feed, will be great to see him back in Toronto. This is one of my favourite Klow moments, when the championship became real. I 'may' have got slightly emotional at this point too (it was about 5am UK time, I was on edge) @Klow7 https://t.co/ZuHlCE2MZF@TangerineHoops @Raptors The @Raptors will put up 112..

- Charlotte Hornets
- Toronto Raptors
- Memphis Grizzlies
- Dallas Mavericks
- Atlanta HawksRe Toronto Raptors game- so what if Kyle Lowry returns to play against them? Thats how it works when one leaves! What's the big deal? Why is Toronto mayor claiming Kyle Lowry Day? He LEFT for more money, etc! So he helped win in 2019 -this is 2022. Let it go! They're a new team!@jamiecam43 @prembry @m_shantz @Raptors Lol. I am not even doing that to be quite honest.  My argument was basic. Achiuwa has made more 3s this year than Bam has shot in  years. @prembry took it personally.  Facts: Precious started the '21 season (weak as hell). Dude has recently improved.  I believe it will continue.@matrixthinker @prembry @m_shantz @Raptors The problem is you see 3's and defensive potential and don't give a damn about what the actual numbers are saying. I am hopeful for  Achiuwa. But there is a big difference between providing hope vs having a solid season. If Achiuwa has a solid year next year it will be his first.@PotterBarry @heybrendan @SteveM_OD @DrTreyMalone @Raptors Raptors draft choice Barry?@PackripEwing @TheJurassicPack @Klow7 @nbatopshot @Raptors It will be an interesting, usually we are the ones pushing the pace on other teams. But Kyle is master at this. Hopefully we don’t taste our own medicine tonight. lol win or lose there’s no way this isn’t going to be a good one.@matrixthinker @prembry @m_shantz @Raptors I wouldn't expect it to be funny to you but IMO Toronto fans will overlook a lot to justify overhyping a player on their team. I've seen it with Trent. I've seen it with Achiuwa.  I saw it with Derozan, Bargnani. Toronto votes with their feelings more than any market out there.Interested to see if the Sixers play the starters today, they’re only 2 games up on Toronto and they play Toronto soon, so the Raptors could easily catch them in the standings. You don’t want to fall to 5 or 6. The Sixers still need to rack up some wins here to secure home courtAm I the only one not looking forward the fan fair tonight with Lowery’s return? We are in a playoff spot…@Raptors should have the spotlight tonight!

Is Heat's Kyle Lowry playing tonight vs. Raptors?

By Kyle Irving

#Toronto #NBA
https://t.co/6k1tSbgxoE@prembry @matrixthinker @m_shantz @Raptors It's quite common nowadays, particularly when discussing players on one's own team, to refer to everything a player isn't good at as "upside". Like the worse you are the more upside you have. It's kind of humorous really. Our fans also do this with Trent.#MIAvsTOR

Just like im entitled to point out how objectively unrealistic these things youre saying are@prembry @jamiecam43 @m_shantz @Raptors We are making progress (now you are saying that I am entitled to be a biased fanboy). Prior tweets I was just a fanboy. haha.  You a good sport @Prembry.  Either way, these words are my opinion, anything can happen in the next two years.  Precious could turn into Ben Simmons. EZ@matrixthinker @jamiecam43 @m_shantz @Raptors Celtics have a great player development system too.  Grant Williams is statistically a top 2-3 spot up shooter in the NBA, particularly from the corners. He also defends

Does all that alone means he has the potential to be better than Bam? No. U dont know how to be unbiasedMiami Heat (50-28, first in the Eastern Conference) vs. Toronto Raptors (45-32, fifth in the Eastern Conference) https://t.co/lGNoNd2Z03@prembry @jamiecam43 @m_shantz @Raptors I cannot comment on Grant Williams. I don know him well enough. And frankly my opinion is not based on the talent of the player alone. It is driven by my respect for Toronto's development system. They have shown over and over again that they can turn lemons into lemonade.@matrixthinker @jamiecam43 @m_shantz @Raptors Yea, they do

You are dismissing the literal facts because they dont align with your biased hopeful outlook and view point

U have no credibility man.

Nothing else to this https://t.co/5ssZ3x6nBb@matrixthinker @jamiecam43 @m_shantz @Raptors Yea they arent close even when u compare their 2nd year.  Not even close

You’re biased.  You’re entitled to be a biased fanboy,  but just dont pretend like you’re not when u try to actually have an NBA debate rooted in reality https://t.co/a5wPjpFgJS@prembry @jamiecam43 @m_shantz @Raptors Those stats dont prove one bit that Bam is a superior talent. It tells me that they are similar (explains why Miami wanted both players). As I wrote in the previous tweet, Miami was developing Precious incorrectly. Raptors have him on a different path and he is making progress.@matrixthinker @jamiecam43 @m_shantz @Raptors So Grant Williams, one of the best 3pt shooters in the league and way better than Achiuwa,  also has more potential than Bam?  

Pure bias, theres nothing else to say about your insistence on this@matrixthinker @jamiecam43 @m_shantz @Raptors No, the stats say Precious in his second year was nowhere near Bam in his second year 

You’re on an island alone with this one.  No unbiased person thinks Achiuwa can ever be as good as Bam and the numbers support that https://t.co/UNleYIrzPcToronto Raptors - Miami Heat

And my analysis says you are dead wrong.@matrixthinker @jamiecam43 @m_shantz @Raptors These are Precious stats.  Not not very good at all.  Hes not even close to as impactful as Bam was his second year. https://t.co/WIitXLSBm8@prembry @jamiecam43 @m_shantz @Raptors Finally claiming "Bam is 20/10/4 with dpoy caliber D" is disingenuous. Yeah sure he is 20/10/4 5 years later.  You should be comparing 2017/18 and 2018/19 Bam with the 2020/21 Precious (that Miami was ruining) and the 2021/22 Precious that the @Raptors will turn into a star.@prembry @jamiecam43 @m_shantz @Raptors Translation: Precious is averaging more pts in his 2nd year because he is being developed to be a 3pt threat that can spread the floor &amp; defend 1 through 5. Such a player will ALWAYS be more valuable in the modern NBA. Calling me bias will never change that.@numberxlv @porcogrosso_ @Raptors has been an exciting team to watch most of the season.

In his 1st year, Bam played twice as many mins, but only scored 1.9 more pts got 2.1 more rebounds. 2nd year, Bam scored less points &amp; secured only 0.6 more rebounds.

He is always practising his basketball skills while repping #7. Thank you, Kyle, what an amazing role model!
#KLowinTO@TangerineHoops @Raptors Lowry #7DaysofGiveaways@TangerineHoops @Raptors Junkyard Dog@TangerineHoops @Raptors Kyle Lowry all day every day!!! #7DaysofGiveawaysHey @Klow7 . It’s my best friends birthday tomorrow and she is your Biggest fan! We can’t get your hands on tickets for tomorrow night, any way you could help a girl out? #TorontoRaptors #LowrysComingHomeShould @Klow7 jerseys be retired for the @Raptors once he retires? #NBA #WeTheNorth@BriscoeRob @Turbo05 He’s a huge Raptors fan. Loves everything Toronto. 😳🤔@TangerineHoops @Raptors Vince carter #7DaysofGiveaways@sp_136_Rp @timandfriends @Raptors @IsiahThomas Yeah. I agree. Back in early March, Shaq said that no one was worried about playing the Raptors in a play in tournament. I say, he hasn’t seen them play enough. They have great defense and many good scorers.@Raptors @KDTrey5 @ScottBarnes561 king KDAug 10 2019 NXT Takeover Toronto Also great for entrances @JohnnyGargano and a Raptors championship tribute https://t.co/CmDSCXY5pp@1_dirr @NBA @pskills43 @Raptors happy 17 birthday!!!Toronto Raptors vs Orlando Magic Full Game Highlights | April 1 | 2022 NBA Season #Toronto #Raptors #NBA Video: https://t.co/2higWK1zvX@ElleWitch61 @timandfriends @Raptors @IsiahThomas They have beat everyone and beat the convincingly. Any 7 game series is going to be a fight to the death… @Raptors@yyz_bliss @Raptors @Klow7 We love us some KLow!!!@mikemazen3 @alipustero @RMarsonet @WalderSports There's a genuine possibility the Raptors don't exist without Vince Carter. They didn't want Canadian teams in the league, got rid of the Grizz in Vancouver and I have no doubt would've done the same to Toronto if arguably the leagues most popular player for a time wasn't there.@bObO6ix @PistonsMuse @ScottBarnes561 @Raptors he’s played 60 games..Keefe is channeling Nick Nurse of the @Raptors and mixing up his lines. Interesting to see how it pans out.

#LeafsForever@TangerineHoops @Raptors The Klaw...Kawhi Leonard...he was only here for a short time, but he pushed The Raptors over the top to the promised land!!! #7DaysofGiveaways@ToxicTiger777 @Raptors @KDTrey5 @ScottBarnes561 Thank you@sp_136_Rp @timandfriends @Raptors Seen @IsiahThomas call the Raptors “sneaky good” on NBATV last week. He was praising up Pascal too.@TangerineHoops @Raptors #7DaysofGiveaways @TangerineHoops KYLE LOWRYYYYYYY making his return tomorrowAll time favourite @Raptors is @pskills43.
