Ah yes, The Cleveland CavaliersTonight’s Cavs game against the Nets will be my 526th straight @Cavs game watched - including preseason, regular season and playoffs

The last game I missed was at Nets on 27th March 2015 - my tablet wouldn't connect to WiFi at the United Center so couldn't watch that oneThe @cavs were without Jarrett Allen and Lauri Markkanen when they faced the Nets five days ago. With those two returning to the lineup tonight, J.B. Bickerstaff believes his team can get back to doing what it does best.
