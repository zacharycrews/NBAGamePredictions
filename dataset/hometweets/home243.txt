1️⃣Bucks/Magic u215 (-110)

2️⃣Magic TT u101.5 (-115)

Both these teams are on a back to back. Milwaukee just had a no sweat under yesterday vs the Thunder. Magic will be without their leading scorer, Cole Anthony… Let’s get these Bucks💸 https://t.co/dVqi7IVfbSTonight is all about “Bucking the trend” for the Magic. 

Last season scores vs Milwaukee: 124-87. 121-99. 114-102 – that’s an average margin of 24 points in the favor of the Bucks. 

Here's to hoping a Cole-less Magic squad can give us a closer contest. https://t.co/NqLCFoIz6QHey @UK_Bucks when you come to milwaukee I have a little 🎁 for you @FiservForum court. This one has your name on it. https://t.co/dtSEoHyRiS1U Washington Wizards +2.5

Bucks played last night, in milwaukee again (tougher to score there) and cole anthony, the entire magic offense, is out tn. Dont see magic scoring 100, low 90s or in the 80s for them

#nba #sportsbettingThe Magic are in Milwaukee for an 8pm tip, and trail the all time series 53-64.

Our past performance tonight is Tracy McGrady, who on March 18th 2002 put up 48 points to lead the Magic past the Bucks 101-91, to move a half game ahead of the Bucks in the East’s playoff race. https://t.co/QdXTMly40BLet me find some cheap Bucks tickets since I’m in Milwaukee for the day I will go by myself no problemConsensus Line Move:
