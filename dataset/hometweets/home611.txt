… Dawgs are on top! https://t.co/CoI9v2FQup.@TheTraeYoung from @ATLHawks is an #NBAAllStar. 💪❄️@Kugla4 @HawksOnBally @ATLHawks There is room to criticize Trae.  3 or 4 good new players is a stretch.@GreekFreek35 Bunch of role players and Derozan (who is a glorified role player). 

They’re the 2014 Atlanta Hawks.@HawksOnBally @TheTraeYoung @ATLHawks As great as Trae is......he has to LEAD this team.   That includes getting everybody on the same page, playing defense and leading by example.  Once he can do that he will be an all time great and lead us to a championship!@JFila4 Bunch of role players. Look like the 2014/15 Atlanta Hawks to a tee.Chicago Bulls are frauds. They’re the 2021 Knicks  / Atlanta Hawks of the 2010’s@HawksOnBally @TheTraeYoung @ATLHawks How’s he rank on DEFENSE!!!@ATLHawks @CapelaClint Why lol@ToukiToussaint @ATLHawks UGAg isn’t Atlanta. GT is in Atlanta, the Dwags are in the cesspool.Ok @AtlantaFalcons &amp; @ATLHawks It’s y’all time to win a championship. The #Braves did it and now the #Bulldogs did. Step it up and play like a champion.@elleduncanESPN @Realrclark25 @mspears96 2021-2022 is the year(s) of Georgia sports.  Braves win the World Series, the bulldogs win the Natty.  Next maybe is the Atlanta hawks winning the NBA championshipBack from @ATLHawks @skylarmayscP4 putting on 1st half show with @CPSkyhawks game-high 16 points on 2-4 3FG with 5 assists as College Park leads Grand Rapids Gold 65-46 at the break at @GatewayArena. Join us on @peachtreeTV @ESPNPlus https://t.co/cbHnYFqXVs@CaptDeadpool316 AEW is going to sue too eventually if they keep getting locked out of arena's like the Atlanta Hawks arena or Madison Square Garden.@ATLHawks please don’t trade Collins for Simmons!!! Noooooooo!This the mess I’m talking about. If the @sixers think Tobias is overpaid. Why in the world would the @ATLHawks not think the same thing?
