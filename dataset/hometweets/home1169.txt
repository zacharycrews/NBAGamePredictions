It’s an indication the PG doesn’t trust his teammates ability to score. Problematic when the PG’s primary role is distribution, implementation &amp; tempo regulation.@LA_Broadus @Joewalkedout @CavsNotes @dariusgarland22 @cavs @NBA Love Garlamd but as a #3option and think Collin is a #1.5-2option for the simple fact that Collin will get his off o matter who you out out there with him 

I think Garlamd is more dependent on having other elite players 

I damn sure don't agree with him being 100 M more@CavsNotes @cavs In the toughest Conference in the NBA.@cavs Cavs legend@cavs Cavaliers legend Moses BrownAveraging 14.3 points &amp; 11.7 rebounds over the last three games 💪 #LetEmKnow https://t.co/JZJwNtjHOb@hiramboyd @LA_Broadus @CavsNotes @dariusgarland22 @cavs @NBA Dude, I really don’t know how you don’t understand this. Darius had not been struggling, he’s averaged 25 and 10 since the all star break, and the cavs have gone through injury hell. You asked why DG gets paid, and it’s because he makes the whole team better. Colin does not.@hiramboyd @Joewalkedout @CavsNotes @dariusgarland22 @cavs @NBA Do you not like Garland or are you just a Sexton stan I'm confused because I know you know ball but this is getting crazyCheck out this listing I just added to my #Poshmark closet: Vintage Cleveland Cavaliers champion jersey. https://t.co/QonXaBZQ9S #shopmycloset @poshmarkapp@CavsNotes @dariusgarland22 @cavs @NBA That’s actually a bad thing when your point guard is the leading scorer. When the person who has the ball the most, control where it goes and responsible for implementing the offensive system scores the most/takes the most shots that’s a recipe for disaster long term.Sooo @cavs when is my guy  @KingJames getting his statue outside of the arena it’s definitely warranted. Tell them  @stephenasmith we need that on ASAP!Moses!

You watch the box scores. 1) I never said he couldn’t score. 2) Stats are borderline meaningless on bad teams. Points will come in the NBA, What doesn’t come in the NBA is winning.

Positions are borderline obsolete these days. i.e. LeBron, Jokic, Luka are all elite ball distributors and are point guards in play style.@Joewalkedout @jenn554120301 @CavsNotes @LA_Broadus @dariusgarland22 @cavs @NBA What he was suppose to catch and shoot all day ??@jenn554120301 @hiramboyd @CavsNotes @LA_Broadus @dariusgarland22 @cavs @NBA Every game Colin played for the cavs, he never figured out how to play off the ball. Either he was running the point and dominating the ball, or he’s doing absolutely nothing off the ball.@Joewalkedout @CavsNotes @LA_Broadus @dariusgarland22 @cavs @NBA You said elite point guard@Joewalkedout @LA_Broadus @CavsNotes @dariusgarland22 @cavs @NBA He's a combo guard and when playing the #2 was every bit if not better as his peers

Look at the numbers 

23 year old who score damn near 25 ppg and 5 apg should come off the bench at 22 years old 

Yeah I see what the problem is 
You don't know hoops 

I'm out@hiramboyd @CavsNotes @LA_Broadus @dariusgarland22 @cavs @NBA Giannis is an elite primary ball handler and distributor good sir. Hell, even Jrue is pretty damn good.@hiramboyd @LA_Broadus @CavsNotes @dariusgarland22 @cavs @NBA Colin most certainly was a point guard and sucked at it, he dominates the ball and can’t create offense for his teammates. If he was infused into this cavs offense with DG running the offense and Colin coming off the bench, I think it’d be great.@Joewalkedout @CavsNotes @LA_Broadus @dariusgarland22 @cavs @NBA Who was elite ball handler on that team and distributor ??@75__South @216kobraEli @SportsTrumpATL @cavs Be a better human.@cavs got a bright bright futurePhiladelphia 76ers visits Cleveland Cavaliers Predictions and Preview for 4/3/2022 today.

Who won't it last year ??@hiramboyd @Joewalkedout @CavsNotes @dariusgarland22 @cavs @NBA Garland is a better player than Sexton. You will not change my mind and everyone knows it@hiramboyd @CavsNotes @LA_Broadus @dariusgarland22 @cavs @NBA Look, Darius is the cavs point guard, and in the NBA you can’t win without  an elite point guard/ball distributor. Darius is elite. Darius gets paid. Plain and simple.@Joewalkedout @LA_Broadus @CavsNotes @dariusgarland22 @cavs @NBA He wasn't the point 
You ever see Garland tryi to play off ball ??@Joewalkedout @CavsNotes @LA_Broadus @dariusgarland22 @cavs @NBA This is so wrong 

Allen was basically very average last year 

Collin was NOT the point guard last year 
Didn't have love 
Rubio, Mobley 
Markannen@LA_Broadus @hiramboyd @CavsNotes @dariusgarland22 @cavs @NBA I like Colin too, but boy it was painful to watch him be a point guard@Joewalkedout @CavsNotes @LA_Broadus @dariusgarland22 @cavs @NBA No he wasn't .@Joewalkedout @hiramboyd @CavsNotes @LA_Broadus @dariusgarland22 @cavs @NBA We can’t alter reality abs say sexton ran the offense when he in fact didn’t. Garland has been running the offense since 2019. We can’t act like that was the case if we wanna have an opinion  based on facts@Joewalkedout @LA_Broadus @CavsNotes @dariusgarland22 @cavs @NBA He's not perfect for damn sure ...he's a true combo guard 

Garland incapable of carrying a team without other elite players around him 

Garland better passer for sure Collin far superior d
Scorer and far more ability on defense too@hiramboyd @CavsNotes @LA_Broadus @dariusgarland22 @cavs @NBA For one, Colin was our starting point guard and primary ball handler for all of last season. Rubio helped early but obviously got hurt. I wouldn’t say Allen improved. lauri and Mobley are great additions but meaningless without Darius at point guard, it’s just a fact.@Joewalkedout @hiramboyd @CavsNotes @dariusgarland22 @cavs @NBA Garland is better I'm not debating that. I'm just saying Collin was trying with no help@Joewalkedout @CavsNotes @LA_Broadus @dariusgarland22 @cavs @NBA Wait wasn't Garlamd on those teams that lost too ??

I guess getting 
Health Love 
Markannen 
Mobley 
Rubio 

Improved Allen 
Improved Cedi 

Had nothing to do with it 

His struggles are direct correlation to when players  for hurt 

Sexton maintained excellence playing/ Canton@LA_Broadus @hiramboyd @CavsNotes @dariusgarland22 @cavs @NBA I am. Colin is incapable of running a half court offense if you watch the tape. He can score the ball and he’s great in transition, but Darius is far superior of a distributor and scorer.@Joewalkedout @hiramboyd @CavsNotes @dariusgarland22 @cavs @NBA I wouldn't compare that. Collin didn't have as much help or the environment from this season. I'm not knocking him on that@hiramboyd @CavsNotes @LA_Broadus @dariusgarland22 @cavs @NBA Last season the Cavs had 22 wins with Colin running the offense, this season the Cavs have 43 wins and will mostly likely get 1-2 more. I’d say 100m is worth it. I think Colin is fine and would be very nice to have on this team rn, but DG elevates the whole roster.#LetEmKnow plays its second-to-last regular season home game vs. @sixers at 6 p.m. @cavs have four total games remaining before the #NBA75 play-in tournament. https://t.co/dJaFwsrEZY@Joewalkedout @CavsNotes @LA_Broadus @dariusgarland22 @cavs @NBA Explain@CavsNotes @dariusgarland22 @cavs @NBA Young king https://t.co/ur8rZn5mUT@hiramboyd @CavsNotes @LA_Broadus @dariusgarland22 @cavs @NBA Yes you can@lsn92620 @216kobraEli @SportsTrumpATL @cavs You must be from Cleveland.
