You live in New York, so it insists on you watching the Knicks/Nets with local cable networks.On this date in 1959,

NBA Legend Wilt Chamberlain made his NBA debut for the Philadelphia Warriors. 

The Big Dipper scored 43 points and grabbed 28 rebounds as the Warriors beat the New York Knicks, 118 - 109.

17 - 27 FG
9 - 15 FT

Proverbs 3: 5 - 6.@NBA_NewYork @NBATV Barkley’s analysis before the Hawks series was spot on. After Randle, the next 5 best scorers were Hawks. And it was too much for the Knicks. Swapping out EP &amp; Bullock for Kemba &amp; Fournier helps a LOT. As does self-improvement by RJ, IQ &amp; Obi.#OTD in 1974 Bob McAdoo scores 28 and Jim McMillan 24 as the Buffalo Braves defeat the New York Knicks 111-91 in a home game played in front of 5,981 fans in Toronto Canada. https://t.co/5kJrAlxC1YTHE NEW YORK GI…KNICKS PLAY TODAY‼️Tonight, the 1st place New York Knickerbockers are hosting the Orlando Magic at The Garden.
