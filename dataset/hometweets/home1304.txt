#SportsGambling @XXXMEEZY@Freakzforeel @adysssal If Phoenix wins this game and I know for sure that Booker will be 100% through the Finals, I’d say the Suns. If there are any question marks about that, I’d take whoever comes out of the east. Probably Boston. 

(disclaimer - I have never once won money betting on basketball)Wad that @Katastro I heard on the @suns warm-up??

Mavericks first-quarter (+2)(-110) against the Suns

Mavericks (+7) against the Suns

If the Suns lead by 5 or more at half, that is a sign to hedge out and take Suns second-half as Phoenix may rout Dallas if they enter halftime with such a lead.Game 7!

Like, if I had to choose between watching them win a chip or selling my book…I mean, I’d choose my book, BUT I WOULD HESITATE FOR HALF A SECOND BEFORE MAKING MY DECISION.Could BAYC own their own NBA team?

They have the means, they have the star power.

And now they have the jersey.

Can the Suns advance to the WCF in hopes of avenging their finals loss last year?
Can the Mavs shock the world and take down the top seeded Suns?
Neither team has won a road game this series.
Phoenix is the home team. 

Who advances to the Western Conference Finals?Cpflop will never be the face of the Phoenix Suns. This is DEVIN BOOKER’S TEAM. Don’t get it twisted. I remember when they tried to pull the shit about how it was KD’s warriors and we put them in their place and said this is Stephen Curry’s team.@Suns @PlayAtGila Lasagna lu going fishingAbout to put my body through it right now. Only 18% recovered from yesterday according to my #whoop. Get in a nice long run before the @Suns v. Mavs game. Calm the nerves a bit. #Game7vibes #RallyTheValley #DALvsPHX@SuzRedSea @Suns Rocking! 💜🧡💜🧡💜Ok, let’s shift focus to Suns vs Mavs. 

What does Luka need to do to pull off the win in Phoenix?@jjonah415 Seems like we lost to Dallas a few times and played Suns well, but id still rather play Dallas.

You gotta be executing at a really high level to keep up with Phoenix. Dallas will have clunkers.@buddabaker32 @Suns I'm here let's #GOSUNS!! https://t.co/mzcBeOzkGTIf @celtics beat the @MiamiHEAT they're winning the chip and vice versa.

Series tied 3-3 (WIN OR GO HOME)

Game hosted at Footprint Center (Suns home court) at 5:00 PM PT on TNT. Game is in about 1 hour and a half. Good luck to you both teams, and have fun!@Suns growing up with the Suns #RallyTheValley https://t.co/3RG6XtmXCUThis State needs a Phoenix Suns win tonight so badly. Please, Let’s Go @Suns #RallyTheValleyoddly, I think Dallas is a worse matchup for the Warriors than Phoenix even though the Suns have Ayton and a way better team with more depth...@NBA @Grant2Will @Suns @nazsuns @nbagleague As part of the draft workout, we had each player take turns shooting a series of 50 3s and recorded their scores.

I was the rebounder.

Grant was the ONLY player of the 60+ that summer to help me rebound.

The lesson: Give it long enough and character will eventually win out.@NBA The year @Grant2Will entered the @NBA Draft, we had 60+ players participate in pre-draft workouts for the @Suns.

I'll be honest. Grant was underwhelming. I was coaching the @NAZSuns at the time and expected him to be in the @nbagleague.

But one thing did make him stand out...@_dashingxmizfit @Bucks @Suns Get out of here rooting for the suns. Psh@Suns Take the Dub@Suns see how you defend Giannis?!?! Y’all made no adjustments and didn’t win the chip!

Pretty damn disappointing if you ask me. Again, that’s if they lose.

Suns are the better team and Game 7 is in Phoenix. I like their chances tonight. https://t.co/CzUdyrOOk3Yes! The Bucks lost. Now time for Phoenix to do their thing.

Thank you@NBA @dallasmavs @Suns Whatever gang says who will win@MissSugarplum6 @Suns Y’all got it!!@Suns @PlayAtGila Let's hope that the referees call a consistent game at both ends of the court. Dallas has been allowed (at times) to use their hands or body to bump Booker &amp; Paul off course with their dribble or cuts...w/o a foul called.

I got @Bucks and @SunsThe Dallas Mavericks will defeat the Phoenix Suns tonight and advance to the Conference Finals #MFFLDallas Mavericks: Phoenix Suns vs. Dallas Mavericks:  Game 7 betting odds https://t.co/KsNb9x9rZ9@anthonyVslater They could sure use both of them against Phoenix. Not sure why Warriors are slight favorites over the Suns. They’ll have to play a lot better than they did against the Grizzlies to have a realistic chance. Shoot better, eliminate the sloppy play and continue to play solid defense@MrRickySpanish Hell no. 👎 I want Larry Bird 2.0 out of the NBA Playoffs. I want Chris Paul to lose in the next round or NBA Finals. The Phoenix Suns veterans that have put in the work for more than 5 years deserve to advance. I will always hate Boston though.@kray1voice @Jumpshot8 @Suns Is that a regular pink shirt or a “tight Italian pink shirt?” 😄🔴𝐋𝐢𝐯𝐞 𝐋𝐢𝐧𝐤 𝐎𝐧📺 @NBALiveTVNow

pls win Game 7 to help me @Suns@annita416 Phoenix SunsThis isn’t Phoenix’s first rodeo in a Game 7, as @ADecker1138 takes us through the Suns’ prior meetings in the best two words in sports.

#PMSFanDuelSunday7s@itsMissTaco @Suns Your so beautiful 😍@wfaaweather @MeatChurch Phoenix suns fansNBA possible FACT: If CP3 let nerves get to him, and Booker has to carry The Suns, Phoenix will no longer be led by CP3 and become Booker's team. He will have fully emerged. If Booker doesn't his legacy will be hit for a bit, b/c every one expects CP3 to fail at some point.4️⃣ teams to play Win-Or-Go-Home Game 7️⃣.

#PMSFanDuelSunday7sBREAKING: The Dallas Mavericks will whoop that trick and eliminate the Phoenix Suns from the 2022 NBA Playoffs tonight, May 15, 2022. Per @BallsackSports@justinweiss555 But the suns run. Warriors need to run. Also, CP3 is tiring out. You can see it. I don’t think the suns can keep up. We just need to get one in Phoenix. I believe we can bear both teams.

It will reach its peak at 8:30 pm Phoenix time, at which time most of us will probably be on the road home. An interesting coincidence. Hopefully, we won’t notice because of all the celebrating.Luka will once again own the Phoenix Suns while Piss Paul blows another 2-0 lead 🤣

#PMSFanduelSunday7sI think Celtics/Heat will be more interesting than Heat/Bucks so I’m rooting for the Celtics. And the entire Phoenix Suns roster is annoying so Im going for the Mavs. They’ll both probably lose thoughThe Suns are at a new crossroads. They are at the dangerous intersection of survival and scorn. 

@danbickley asks: What does Phoenix become if they lose Game 7 to the Mavs?

Suns 112-Mavs  102The Suns -6 is the play tonight. 

Homecourt advantage will play the biggest equalizer here. Phoenix seems to play off this energy as well as any team in the NBA.

https://t.co/xN3M6QZ7cWLuka Doncic is tied for the worst Game 7 winning% (.000) all-time*.

Devin Booker is tied for the fewest Game 7 losses (0) all-time**.

Make no mistake, tomorrow’s win will belong to the Phoenix Suns.
