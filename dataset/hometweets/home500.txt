This player will be brought to you by the toronto maple leafs and toronto raptors.@Investor1904 @FabrizioRomano So Toronto is owned by MLSE. They own both the raptors and the Toronto maple leafs which both are in salary capped leagues making them extremely profitable. Those teams have been subsidizing TFC.@Investor1904 @FabrizioRomano The conglomerate that owns TFC owns the Toronto Raptors, the Toronto Maple leafs.

Hello Raptors Twitter feed...
Is there a game today? 
Can I attend in person if I have a ticket? 
What is the lineup? 

I cannot understand how the @Raptors misuse social media and treat it as just another advertising channel rather than a way to communicate with fans.#NBA Side

76ers -6.5 1.90

Toronto ravaged by COVID got crushed last outing. Even if they get a few guys back this 76ers team is too big for this Raptors team at full strength let alone whatever they are now.

GL https://t.co/GZm8jmo94uSecond pick of the day.

👉 Seth Curry +3.5 assists

📊 2.25
🗓 Philadephia 76ers at Toronto Raptors

🧑‍💻 He scored 9 last game and hit this  5 of his last 5. Raptors should have some guys back (Birch, Trent, Siakam), making the game more intereristing.Congratulations to wilderr67 who moved up 2 spots to take #38 on the Toronto Raptors team leaderboard.

A non sold out arena in an amazing city just makes me sad smh.The Toronto Raptors could be getting some reinforcements as Pascal Siakam, Gary Trent Jr. and Khem Birch are all listed as questionable ahead of Tuesday's game.

You can cheer for:
@Raptors and @BlueJays
as there are no Vancouver equivalents.

You need to root against:
@MapleLeafs and @TorontoArgos.

You look at us as too corporate and uptight.@richcoastrican Hadn’t thought that far ahead but Canada definitely needs representation as witnessed by Toronto’s support for the Raptors.
