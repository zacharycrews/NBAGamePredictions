During this 2-gm stretch for the Knicks, on a scale of "raw deal" to "bailed out" NY falls under the former. The NBA has said as much.This is like a 11am game for Denver, @nyknicks better have a good startWe've seen @Double0AG step up all season. Check out just how good he has been of late!

He carries the weight of this team--no blaming when things don't go well and no gloating when they do. Solid, like a rock. We fans want perfection out of him. Most other places, a 27-year old is just starting out. So... respect.I hope if the @nyknicks watch Illinois closely they would pick @kxng_alpha he would be a good player for NY@amandawoolleyy @steven_schill @Raptors @nyknicks That’s dope !If the New York Knicks are smart then they should strongly consider drafting Ochai Agbaji.  In 3 halves of play in New York this season Ochai has a total of 45 points.  #KUbball #Jayhawks@p_papanic I hope my New York Knicks@nyknicks trade for @BolBol man.

Hyped up knicks fans mimicked the sound during a knicks mini parade and it took off@nyknicks Needs more shots@ImStillThatGuy @nyknicks What about darius bazley@AboutToRatioU @nyknicks Zone defense brotha! They played it all night. Thibs wanted that Nikola jumper the guards were supposed to hedge quicker on that. Not all on Big Mitch at all. His help at the rim was fantastic though.How ya'll feeling?? Like we should win 4 out of the next 5 right?? That's not too much to ask??

#NewYorkForever
#NewYorkKnicks https://t.co/Wkafhy1vyR@balldontstop @nyknicks also a big reason why that offense gets stagnant. his ball stopping tendencies are a tough watch. knicks a lot better to me when rose/burks initiate offense, the ball is moving, and randle gets his within the flow while making quick decisions. his hero ball stuff has to go.@FOS @BrooklynNets vs. @nyknicks at the Rucker. Maybe not a million, but I would like to see it.@tiojacko @KOT4Q And those people will be fans of the Knicks. Not fans of Randle. If Randle weren’t in New York, you think he’d get as much attention as he is now?@nyknicks On the bright side, the offense has looked better since burks took over the starting PG role. It’s the defense that’s really killing us. We can’t just turn the ball over 10 times a game and give up easy points. Also can’t trade buckets like we were doing last night.@nyknicks Cannot lose tomorrow. Nuggets have no depth.@kellypedersen @nyknicks @nicholasbraun Wow trueExactly trust the hard work our guys put in. We got this #KnicksNation @J30_RANDLE @nyknicks https://t.co/RrTkztqwlu@nyknicks I love Randle and he is an amazing player, but his demeanor and body language when team is down can throw me off sometimes and maybe the team? That needs to change.What great memories  last night at the garden... All the fathers organizations from the 5 borroughs showed up and came together..

No way that happens though, right? https://t.co/oUkumlFms3@OrinLupe @nyknicks You 🤡, Anyone with a brain knows that a big man usually protects the paint.

The Atlanta game sims played great which shows hes getting better and make the most out of the minutes he get. now if he was sick yesterday then thats understandable.@KevvyKev1718 @malchpattt @nyknicks Truth!@OrinLupe @nyknicks Sims was sick yesterday and Sims is a rookie that needs a bit of time to learn the NBA. 
How can you or i tell when Sims is out of position or messes up the team defense ?!

G🏀 New York G🏀 New York G🏀!!! https://t.co/U6yVk3Mt9D@KingThings_ @nyknicks I agree with you 100%. I was so pissed off watching game see mitch and Randle literally gasping for air. He needs to do a 60-40 split minutes with randle and obi and depending on centers available if its like last night then 60/40 mitch and sims.@nyknicks @nicholasbraun @petalchinchilla I’m obsessed pls@nyknicks In a loss, who cares.   Have to win games@KingThings_ @nyknicks thibs being thibs burning his guys into the ground. I think if he played sims more that game and more obi because randle was obviously tired, we likely wouldve had a better outcome. sims brings good defense and energy.@nyknicks @thetopballers_ Why is one of obi's eye higher than the other😂😂@nyknicks Can we just please go on a win streak and stop messing up in the last 5 mins of a game.  This is my Christmas wish.  Thank you knickerbockers #NewYorkForever@OrinLupe @nyknicks I can’t believe thibs didn’t even have Sims dressed.  Last night we needed him after Taj got thrown out.  He may be young and inexperienced but after his performance in ATL he should be rewarded with more minutes@nyknicks Yeah battling the refs whenever he set a pick@nyknicks no quit but no win@nyknicks Only if that task is going right! We need him to ascend 🙌🏽@KingThings_ @nyknicks he can always do better of course but he starts looking real good when our guards do a better job of man defense which means he wont have to sag off his man to help out as much. plus thibs need to put sims in to give mitch a dam rest. dude was exhausted.@OrinLupe @nyknicks You make a good point, our guys need to do a better job of pick dodging and playing under the screen@HanaHoops @chicagobulls Frauds Neva Dat Forget Yo Weak Lil New York Knicks Team Dey Haven’t Even Won A Championship Since 1973 No Comparisons😭😭😌💁🏽‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️💯@balldontstop @nyknicks i didnt think u were a stats casual@PlayoffBoundNYK @nyknicks @thetopballers_ @spidadmitchell Dont sleep on toppin,  dudes a beast@nyknicks @thetopballers_ Toppin looks BAKED@wcknicks @nyknicks @deucemcb11 He gotta go all day engine.

🎨 @thetopballers_ | #KnicksArtFriday https://t.co/ReCL3RuKFN@nyknicks Wasn’t enough@KevvyKev1718 @nyknicks sims shouldve been in to spell mitch. He was exhausted. fukn thibs be pissing me off.@KingThings_ @nyknicks which in turn leaves his man wide open and no one to help him recover@KingThings_ @nyknicks the reason we lost was because our guys cant play defense for shit. how is it all you see is mitch give open looks to Vuc but not see that our guards arent fight over screens or keeping their man in front of them. any smart person can see he has to sag to help them recover@nyknicks Time to string some wins together and go I still believeEvery time there's a power conference opening Mark Few's name gets thrown in. Add Maryland to the list now along with, among others, Oregon, Arizona (multiple times), Indiana, UCLA, and the New York Knicks.@nyknicks Mitch was helping to guard the person coming off the screen,it’s not his fault his man wasn’t picked up by someone.This is because most of the players don’t know how to rotate and be able to help https://t.co/RCwBEsu1iF fundamentals@BrerAnansi @nyknicks or get sims in the game. thibs burning this nigga to exhaustion and he not even 100%@TADO4REAL @nyknicks he was injured all off season and recovering. most he could do was put on weight he couldnt do cardio because he had to let his foot injury recover.@wcknicks @nyknicks @deucemcb11 Need this guys energy on the knicks@balldontstop @nyknicks Thanks for showing him much deserved love he is an all star.@JohanPe46828726 @Kivi015 @nyknicks @23savage____ because they not real actual basketball fans that understand the game or even follow the team and the happenings.

The Knicks need them both@hopefulmetsfan @nyknicks Man do some of y'all understand basketball.. cant you see iq gets beat by his man and if you know basketball you have to sag to cover.

Am I wrong?@LordMora_ @PlayoffBoundNYK @nyknicks bro what the hell you talking about he was always leaking to get a block leaving a gap between him and his man and he's man was killing him on the 3 what those that have to do with playing why you playing crate ball smh mitch always play like he's drunk overrated defender.@yodafresh1 @IshSmithBetter @nyknicks Correct on IQ’s error, BUT, once our defense breaks down it’s Obi’s job to react and make Vuc think twice/upset his rhythm by hedging over just a little bit.

The man with the ball and the open man are the most dangerous players on the floor.@RealMichaelKay @TMKSESPN @TMKSonYES @ESPNNY98_7FM @nyknicks As much as I think you are totally off on Brian Kelly, his speech was hilarious.

And the @WaltFrazier happened💥☝🏾 https://t.co/mMElOOIPaLI see lots of panic about the New York Knicks, and... I think they’re still firmly in the mix for a top-6 spot/avoiding the play-in.

Last few games have been promising.

Definitely a play-in team, minimum.@Rosegoldsweats9 @aranauto2 @nyknicks No it’s literally not lol people make the all star team and don’t even play in the regular season 😂😂😂 see Kyrie Irving star means he’s one of the top players in the league which he doesn’t even crack the top 50 so no he’s not a “star” not even close casual 🥱😂
