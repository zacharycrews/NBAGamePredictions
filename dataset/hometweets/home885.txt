I love this team so much !!Did you know:
Out of all 450+ players Michael Jordan ever played against as a Chicago Bull he, on average, outscored every single one of them except for one man. 

That man's name is Allen Iverson.@MaskedAyo @GamingLos1 @chicagobulls His pregame ritual is eating at Pandas@Michael_Cerami The players should hold out until they get what they want! All I ask from u &amp; chicago media is do not say it's unlikely for any chicago team 2 win or compete for a title this season! AKME changed 11 roster spots with little cap space making the Bulls 1st in the EAST &amp; a contenderTristan Thompson displayed his personality while meeting the Chicago media, riffing on the Warriors’ former Big 3, deep-dish pizza and beating DeMar DeRozan in the playoffs.

That voice is one of the key attributes the Bulls sought.

Notice how these three players spend a lot of time together and with Coach Mo Cheeks!

They use career numbers only for MJ teammates, so they can bake in young and old years. Grant was 11 RPG his last year in Chicago. Bulls also got 9 RPG from their SF.@MsMeliss @chicagobulls @sentrock @AmericanExpress Thank you 😭🙏@chicagobulls @RealTristan13 Nice 🔥Hall of Fame education. https://t.co/voSDz0FiCU@chicagobulls Thank you for this@chicagobulls @RealTristan13 Chip incoming@chicagobulls Must be nice@sixandzero23 @andreaswoj57 @stephenasmith @Chris_Broussard @RicBucher @BillSimmons 1991: 50%, 51%, 52%, 53%
