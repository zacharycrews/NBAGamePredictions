AKME changed 11 roster spots with little cap space making the Bulls 1st in the EAST &amp; a contenderTristan Thompson displayed his personality while meeting the Chicago media, riffing on the Warriors‚Äô former Big 3, deep-dish pizza and beating DeMar DeRozan in the playoffs.

That voice is one of the key attributes the Bulls sought.
