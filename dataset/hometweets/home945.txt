I believe the top 3 #ChicagoBulls defenders are injured, but with them I don't think the bulls would've given up 130 to the hawks. #BullsNationi would rep this all over arizona. i need this please @chicagobulls ❤️❤️ https://t.co/RhYFQcKaqN@chicagobulls @BMOHarrisBank Everywhere 🔥🔥Chicago Bulls go into tonight’s game against Milwaukee Bucks on the back of 3 straight defeats.

Terrible spot for Chicago here.@jawkneeQ @chicagobulls_12 @RatiodbyBando @CodyWesterlund should we turn the dialogue to discussing the Bulls record against playoff teams?

Everyone &amp; their mom knows Bucks, Heat, Sixers, Nets (full strength) are a tier above the Bulls. Y’all lack defensive personnel to guard elite big men in the playoffs, and lack experienceI can’t get it out of my head that a guy called in yesterday to @PatMcAfeeShow and slandered the #chicagobulls saying they are struggling right now…

iTunes: https://t.co/qesSQEOTqPThe Chicago Bulls lost to the Atlanta Hawks by six points. https://t.co/RkQMBdKTn2 suggests that based on the shots from both teams, the Bulls win this game only 8% of the time.

The Bulls were 14/26 | 54% from behind the arc and 17/23 | 74% at the rim to keep them in this game. https://t.co/RfcHjjROMYAll I want today is @LouMalnatis and some @MillerLite while watching my @chicagobulls play.
