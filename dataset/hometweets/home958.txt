But the Milwaukee Bucks didn’t offer the Bulls any chance for redemption, clinching a 118-112 win to send the Bulls into a four-game losing streak.

@byjuliapoe’s story from the UC.

https://t.co/egEPwEEt2AThe Miami Heat just went 3-1 against the Chicago Bulls, Milwaukee Bucks, Brooklyn Nets and Philadelphia 76ers with a combined plus-35 point differential in those four games.

They are also 11-2 in their last 13 and are now 21 games above .500.

You love to see it. #HEATCulture@justbusiness215 @TyJohnsonNews That's stupid. The BEAT Bucks IN MILWAUKEE without Harden. The BEAT Warriors at home without Harden But sure why let facts get in the way of your ridiculous take 😆@Bwellz69420 @TheFoxAndOx @LukaDaDon77 @SacramentoKings @swipathefox @Dsabonis11 @Divincenzo And they weren’t even in Sacramento 🤣 So glad my Milwaukee Bucks finally won one after 50 years. Bucks have had theirs ups and downs. Every decade of bucks history has been 50-50 with half every decade super dominant and half as a worse team.Chicago, Milwaukee, Chicago, and Philly. Miami went 3-1 and the 1 loss was a buzzer beater for the Bucks. Miami ain’t no hoeDIA DE MILWAUKEE BUCKSThe Heat finish a four-game week (Bulls, Bucks, Nets, Sixers) at 3-1, w/the one loss coming by a point in Milwaukee.

Kyle Lowry missed all of those games.

Victor Oladipo debuts on Monday.

The Heat hold a 3 game lead for 1st in the EC, and 10 of their next 11 games are at home.@Divincenzo Dante I like that you haven’t changed your bio or your profile picture. Wish you were still here in Milwaukee where you’d win a lot more. Hope at some point way later in your career as a Free Agent you’ll sign with a Bucks again. Giannis wants to spend his career here@big_dog94 @az_daniel_ @KyleL00 @chicagobulls @Bucks piss off milwaukee is the size of a chicago neighborhood.@MiamiHEAT Jimmy back to his Milwaukee bucks game formYes ma'am!
