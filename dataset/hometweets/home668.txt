Steve Kerr hit the game-winning shot against the Utah Jazz in Game 6 of the 97 NBA Finals. Which won the Bulls thief 5th title. If it wasn’t for that shot, who knows if the bulls would have been able to finish that off.. that shot was pivotal!!Ms. Harris was also the first (and only) woman drafted by an NBA team when the New Orleans (now Utah) Jazz drafted her in 1977.  RIP to a true trailblazer. https://t.co/gCePYa0pC2@utahjazz what y’all think about deni?

We are asking 40 a piece, please let me know if interested! @utahjazzThe Utah Jazz front office has been one of the worst in the league. The current roster has peaked. It will only get worse from here. The Jazz have zero chance to win a championship in the next 5 years. That being said they are still fun to watch and have team of great guys.The Utah Jazz are 0-7 ATS as a double digit favorite in L7 games.Rudy Gay, Utah Jazz Catch Fire From Three In First Half Against Nuggets - KSL Sports https://t.co/uqB9FIYMqiWho wants this #Utah #Jazz hat?? #TakeNote #NBA https://t.co/jE273DQxTu@utahjazz Will @mikegolicjr be in attendance? @CassidyHubbarth @PabloTorreCongratulations to NFTrade (@NFTrade_) who moved up 1 spot to take #10 on the Utah Jazz team leaderboard.

*OUT - Rudy Gay (right heel soreness)

OUT - Donovan Mitchell (Concussion Protocol)
 
OUT - Hassan Whiteside (Health &amp; Safety Protocols) https://t.co/dKsF8Ur1tK@MildNYak @mavsfan505 @utahjazz KP is 100% overpaid but that happens when you blow the draft off most years.@mavsfan505 @realsports89 @utahjazz Yeah but when? U have to guess when he’s gonna play@realsports89 @MildNYak @utahjazz they can't pass him the ball in the post and expect him to create his own shot. Everything is lob or easy dunk for him@realsports89 @mavsfan505 @utahjazz I agree. But if Rudy’s overpaid KP is too by far. Dude has 2 DPOY trophies@MildNYak @realsports89 @utahjazz that is the biggest knock on KP and it's a fair one. I still take KP because he can play both ends@MildNYak @mavsfan505 @utahjazz Everyone has their own opinions about Rudy. Rudy is a great player but you can’t pay max money to centers. It’s very difficult to win championships when the highest paid player is a center and you can’t go to a center and get a basket in the last 5min of a game.@realsports89 @mavsfan505 @utahjazz He never talks about it. Rudy is always available too. KP be aight but we never know when he’s gonna play. That’s just the truth@UtahJazz_France @RocketsnationFr Ainsi que rudy gay.It's funny that the Utah Jazz was the New Orleans Jazz and kept the name when they movedAm I the only Utah Jazz fan who thinks trading Mitchell and pick(s) for a solid wing defender and decent shooting guard is our best bet? I love Don but I think we can downgrade at SG for better wing defense.Rudy Gay is out for the Utah Jazz tonight due to right heel soreness. #utahjazz #NBA@mavsfan505 @utahjazz KP overpaid tooRudy Gay is also out tonight for the @utahjazz due to heel soreness. 

Donovan Mitchell (concussion) and Hassan Whiteside (safety protocols)  are also out against the @HoustonRockets.@mavsfan505 @utahjazz And scratch that about 11. The Jazz are 13 points better per 100 when Rudy is on the floor@mavsfan505 @utahjazz Idk I don’t think it’s really close, it’s closer sure but Rudy is way more valuable to the Jazz than KP is to us. Without Rudy the Jazz defense becomes one of the worst in the leagueToday's NBA Consensus:

And he should have been benched in the playoffs but part of that had to do with his dog shit perimeter defenders. But on a team without traffic cones perimeter players I’m sure any team takes Rudy over cripple KP@mavsfan505 @utahjazz How do you explain the Jazz being 11 points better with Gobert on the floor@mavsfan505 @utahjazz Fed u gotta stop this man 😭😭😭@ScotttyPimpin @utahjazz just watch@mavsfan505 @utahjazz Even suggesting that Porzingis is on the same level as Gobert is an absolute crackpot homer takeGobert is terrible. My Rudy agenda started when Mavs fans started to say he was worth his $200m despite having no offense and calling KP overpaid. KP is currently playing both offense and defense. Bout to show how Rudy cost Jazz game vs LA. Close your eyes Rudy stans @utahjazzPredicting tonight's Ws:

https://t.co/eiaLbBQcmo@utahjazz @MichelobULTRA snooze@dozer5001 @utahjazz @Qualtrics man i dont consider that.. its just he has lot of time sharing play time with other team mates. well bro as you can see, last season is alot more defferent on they proceed on a game play.. compare it bro and you will see. last season only jc has the gats to shoot ball.Chillax @utahjazz fans, it's not even February. Y'all need to calm down, holy Moses it's the NBA.@BillonesRodz @utahjazz @Qualtrics man its just that they all not good that day bog, don, jc and others... u can tell by how may misses they have, lakers vs jazz.. jazz unlucky day.. maybe tired after comeback game with nuggets.And when he catches fire, he's going to be a huge asset. No wonder Jazz fans are the way they are, lazy mid-season bailout articles that calls a key piece to a team a "liability" cuz he's slumping. Lols.

I think that’s a clever thing to do, to keep that to yourself not to harm others. @KingJamesIs there turmoil in this Utah Jazz locker room following social media antics?
https://t.co/KdvDMFDYQt
https://t.co/KdvDMFDYQt@NBAace21 @UnwrittenRul3s Poor placement of personnel by the Utah Jazz head coach, Joe Ingles should be the corner shooter. Ingles would not think twice.
