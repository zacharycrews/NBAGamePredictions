Should New York fully commit to him by giving him the max rookie extension this off-season?

All pretty rough places to be a star athlete and you‚Äôre losing games.@getsit @Mark_R_Pereira @gothedistance49 I‚Äôm already on the record that the guy who loves his CAA agent, is super close to Knicks assistant Johnny Bryant, is from the region and whose SO is a model might be interested in a gig in New York City.The first African American to play in the NBA was Nat Clifton and he played for the @NYKNICKS!!! #BlackHistory #DOPEI fought with fans saying @J30_RANDLE is a number one player for 3 years. I think the culture was good and the @nyknicks should‚Äôve named him Captain.Imo If you give the bag you gotta award the responsibility &amp; teach the leadership.
