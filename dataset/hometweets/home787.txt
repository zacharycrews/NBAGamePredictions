We can’t get to the AAC.Mavericks have 30 games remaining, Memphis has 28. Memphis magic number for division/higher playoff spot than Dallas is 24. 

Let’s say Dallas goes on a tear and wins at a 70% WP rest of the way. That’s 21-9. 

So Memphis has to go 15-13 or better to clinch better than Mavs.@kirkgoldsberry @celtics @Suns @nuggets @dallasmavs @Timberwolves @Lakers @warriors @BrooklynNets @chicagobulls @utahjazz A #6 net with a #20 defense is crazy.

5/12@Hero_OfThe_Day @NBAAllStar @dallasmavs @luka7doncic Yeah. You would say 26,9,9 for doncic this year right?? Logic bro.
If it’s like 27.3, u would round down to 27. 
I know u r a kid that loves doncic so much but hes not that good this season@srslybbym8 @NBAAllStar @dallasmavs @luka7doncic “Round it up” lol ok

You forgot Harden.@Rangers @dallasmavs You should have a pride night, @Rangers@_Tommy76_ @dallasmavs and he'll for sure make all-nba this year, he'll be second team if not first@_Tommy76_ @dallasmavs both would've been nice tho haha@Hero_OfThe_Day @NBAAllStar @dallasmavs @luka7doncic I mean if u round up its 28/9/7. But nvm. He was clearly better than doncic that season and didn’t get the starter position. 
And the fact that stats these days are inflating, I shouldn’t compare it to the past. But luka definitely shouldn’t be the starter this year@NBAAllStar @dallasmavs @luka7doncic Unanamously, and rightfully so....@NBAAllStar @dallasmavs @luka7doncic How much longer could he keep up hos incredible play if he keeps gaining weight. Pretty soon that will effect him. I hope hes trying everything to slow that down@srslybbym8 @Hero_OfThe_Day @NBAAllStar @dallasmavs @luka7doncic Damn those numbers are insane. How is that possible@BadMavsTakes It’s evident that @MavrelloB &amp; @dallasmavs are the same person@BryanCBingham @sunbirdbbq @Carhartt @dallasmavs @MillerLite 10-4!
