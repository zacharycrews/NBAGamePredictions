From this lifelong @HoustonRockets fan, Coach Pop: 

You really are the best.@spurs @safoodbank Don‚Äôt y‚Äôall start with this shit now. How about you put the games on local channels so those of us who live in San Antonio can watch the Spurs without a crazy cable bill?Gregg Popovich won his first game as head coach of the San Antonio Spurs in December of 1996, and became the all-time leader in wins tonight. 48% of all active NBA players right now were not yet born when Pop won his first game as head coach. #PorVidaI was stationed in San Antonio at Fort Sam Houston in '99 when the @spurs won their 1st title. Being a kid from Iowa that had every Bulls game available to watch on local cable in the 90's, I was obviously a fan of MJ. The very 1st weekend off base pass I had was Memorial Day '99When Coach Pop Won His First Game As A Head Coach Of The San Antonio Spurs Back In December 1996 I Was Not Born And Tonight He Picked Win 1336 And He Passed Don Nelson For The NBA‚Äôs All Time Head Coaching Wins List Congrats Coach Pop
#PorVidaGregg Popovich is now the all-time winningest head coach in NBA history.
