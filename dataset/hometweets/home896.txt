#TeamParieur@TheRunawayDrug @Suns Really appreciate that, but it’s not necessary 🙏🏾@WaitingForRona @ESPNNBA @Suns I was about to say the same thing.@Matthews1526 @ESPNNBA @Suns Except for the facts the Suns are better offensively, defensively, and got 2, maybe 3 players better than that Hawks team best player.@ItsBlaze21 @ESPNNBA @Suns feels so rewarding.

Nuggets weren't big, but with Boogie? Joker has a solid backup. Murray and MPJ coming back? That's scary! Just saying... Jazz vs Bucks in the finals.On this day in sports history February 25, the Cleveland Cavaliers traded Kevin Jonson, Mark West, Tyrone Corbin, a 1988 1st Round Pick, a 1988 2nd Round Pick, and a 1989 2nd Round Pick to the Phoenix Suns for Larry Nance, Mike Sanders, and a 1988 1st Round Pick in 1988.@HandlingBizness @Jumpshot8 @DevinBook @Suns Respectfully disagree. Suns lose to the Nuggets in 6. Booker is decent. Paul is fantastic. Healthy Nuggets run through everyone other than the healthy Jazz team.@AdmireIIII @statmuse @Suns @CP3 @DevinBook What a great point 👎🏼 
Counterpoint: CP3 shows up in the Desert and they get to the Finals in Year One of this group being together. 

I think most Fan Bases will take that accomplishment over not getting there.
