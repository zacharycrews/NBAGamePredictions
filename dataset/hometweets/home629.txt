You sound like a straight casual https://t.co/iwwu86DEU4@idknickig I'd say if you want to support a relatively young team that is fun to watch the Memphis Grizzlies is perfect for you. If you want a team that has a good team depth and overall offence,the Chicago Bulls is perfect. If you want to support the worst team,the Magic or the Pistons.Let's see a series win in playoffs.
