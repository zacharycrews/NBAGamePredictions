Trae played over 30 minutes a game as a rookie &amp; finished most games. &amp; it wasn't the end of the season,his numbers upticked post all-star break

Check the tape,&amp; u can find the numbers everywhere

He was bad 1st 10 games. 

Stop Lying!😂@ChesterEugene @dandoublec @BodeSakra @DetroitPistons Liar. I’m also a hawks fan.

Lin was routinely getting more minutes for most of the season. Maybe trae started, but he routinely wouldn’t finish the games. He wasn’t good until the end of the season 

You really lied this bad on the internet, pretending he was good@BeDruyneKev @cwel87 @DetroitPistons Bad year wtf you talking about this draft has 2-4 guys who would be # picks in most draft the last few years and next few#SethCurry scored 23 points, #TyreseMaxey added 20 and the short-handed #Philadelphia76ers beat the #DetroitPistons 109-98 on Thursday night for their fifth straight win.

https://t.co/hxYUQfxs4X@corkin02 @dandoublec @BodeSakra @DetroitPistons You're lying. Hawks fan here,Trae Young started all 81 games he played in his rookie season. Nor was he bad. He averaged 19pts &amp; 8 asts on 41% shooting, 32% from 3 (both slightly below average but not bad for a high usage rookie)

You really lied this bad on the internet.@DetroitPistons Finally!!!Kelly Olynyk comes off the bench and scores 11 points on 4/10 shooting (2/6 from 3, 1/2 FT) with 5 rebounds, a steal, and 2 turnovers in a loss to the 76ers @KellyOlynyk @DetroitPistons@laith120 @DetroitPistons He's in D leaguePistons No. 1 overall pick Cade Cunningham off to worst shooting start to NBA career in almost 50 years

Just facts, you casual 🤡 

Trae Young was terrible as a rookie. Lin started over him for most of the season. And Trae didn’t miss pre season with an injuryShould we really need them? Like Giannis just went into Detroit and ran out the Pistons with 4 guys they found off the street. With the injuries the Lakers are still way more talented than OKC https://t.co/2XbjfNU9FI@SwatByEmbiid @badry2k21 @NBA @CadeCunningham_ @DetroitPistons He had the highest +/- and was a +7 🤨NBA

Enough with Jackson, Joseph and lyles.@Cade2SZN @SwatByEmbiid @NBA @CadeCunningham_ @DetroitPistons Not even lmao if he did read it he'd have seen cade was +7 in a double digit loss lol..@Sixers improve to 2-0 over the @DetroitPistons this season and have now defeated Detroit in 10 of the teams’ last 11 meetings.

Philadelphia has won five straight games, a feat it accomplished on three occasions last season.

Horrible decision starting the bench w/ Jerami forcing everything . Cade’s 1st double-double is awesome even tho his FG% still ass, Killian gained confidence, Jerami was awesome. #Pistons Fun game tho.@BeDruyneKev @cwel87 @DetroitPistons He needs to work on his handle , move around more off ball , off the dribble shot  developmental things I don’t know the exact stat he only missed one free throw and went to the line multiple times I think he can be the best player on a champ team I respect your take we’ll see@SwatByEmbiid @NBA @CadeCunningham_ @DetroitPistons Ben hurting his team every damn day coz he in his feelings lmao 🤣@YassinRaptors @TheGoatWiseman @NBA @CadeCunningham_ @DetroitPistons Cade clears Scottie lmao + ratioCorey Joseph went OFF tonight vs the 76ers!!!

Make it happen weaverI FINALLY have something good to say about the @DetroitPistons. Cade Cunningham. He's multifaceted in skill set, not afraid to drive to the basket, reads the court very well, sets the floor up for his teammates &amp; has great hoop IQ. If his shooting comes along he'll be very nice!The Sixers are now 7-2, defeating the Detroit Pistons &amp; I think that’s lovely@nbatakes123 @NBA @CadeCunningham_ @DetroitPistons On a good team he is maybe, he also had a full preseason and hasn’t missed any time trying to catch up 🤷Cade Cunningham - Detroit Pistons

Caught the cold hand in the 2H. Cunningham looking more comfortable but still only shot 23% tonight. Garbage slate today, not stressed. 

POD: 1-3 (-1.6u)@StrollerAdam @Pistons_PR @DetroitPistons 😂😂😂😂 his feet are stuck in quicksand on the court@DetroitPistons on 20% shooting..The @DetroitPistons is such a sorry ass team right now and Cade looking atrocious, imagine scrubs don't even pass you the ball. Wtf.@tonydombrowski @DetroitPistons one of the first losses of the year I can live with. kept the turnovers down besides one bad stretch, played good D most of the game, and the offense layed out its blueprint of success early. a lot to like from this loss and havent said that much this year so far. good game.@Pistons_PR @DetroitPistons He went 4-17 and we lost.

Put. In. Luka. Garza. We have a scoring machine on the bench and are giving him zero minutes.@DetroitPistons why the hell do we not play Luka GarzaPlease Detroit Pistons….if this is the new style of basketball you guys are playing….just send everyone to the G league….then after you guys do that…fire Dwane CaseyPhiladelphia 76ers sizzles past Detroit Pistons 109-98 Seth Curry 23points 2assists.@tonydombrowski @DetroitPistons Why can Maxey go 45 minutes but our under 21 guards can only log 30 each.

Sixers: 60.5%
Pistons: 39.5% https://t.co/d1wXpQuFxW66-63 @DetroitPistons at halftime@NBA @DetroitPistons @sixers Speed kills Henry Ruggs age!Through two and a half games, Cade Cunningham is shooting 4-30 from the field with just 13 points &amp; has missed all 18 of his three point attempts. Tough start, can only get better. #Detroit #Pistons@DetroitPistons @JeramiGrant @iam_killian @FWJackson15 Love the ball movement, setting up easier shots, Jerami doesn’t know how to miss right now. Cade still struggling shooting but he’s impacting other ways, Stew was struggling but cooking Jojo should give him confidence to bring back that energy, can we give Killian some 💕😳👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻All of a sudden the Detroit Pistons is a team that shoots 52% from the field &amp; 47% from 3, wagering on basketball is some wild shit and certain death 😭😭😭Jerami Grant drops 22 PTS in the first half to give the Pistons the lead at the break!

@DetroitPistons 66
