Gordon is great but he costs too much for too long and is used to a bigger role.@CoachEvanB @Suns Hart. Pound-for-pound a great rebounder, plays multiple positions, shoots well, and has a favorable contract moving forward.@DarthVoita @Suns I’ve liked him since his reaction to James Harden bouncing the ball in frustration and hitting himself on the face, and then Hart pretending to do the same thing a few days later.#WolvesWarmup Minnesota looks to bounce back on the road against the Phoenix Suns.

None of that matters if they can’t win a 7 game series against the Warriors or Grizzlies. As of yet they haven’t shown that they can. 

I’ve got grown kids so miss me with the attempted insult 🤣@ItWasAKindness @akjakalope @Suns … You know all of the players and refs and fans and asked them how much they like and dislike @DevinBook ? #WeirdoThe Suns and Heat sit at No. 1 in their respective conferences and Phoenix has the best record in the NBA, but neither team has an All-Star starter 😬😬😬

Were the teams snubbed? Or did voters get it right? https://t.co/s2kcr7z4rL@SavageSznMedia0 @DevinBook @NBA @Suns Only person he could start over would be Ja since he the only other guard (def not over Steph) and they about even in stats, but I do think they should have somehow made him the 3 or something over WigginsThe phoenix suns were disrespected on all-star voting!!@BALLYSPORTSAZ @23bdonks Go Phoenix Suns! 📊 #ValleyProud #NBA #NBATwitter #NBAInformaticsStarting at 23:59z: Winter is here and it is getting cold up north.

Its built this way for CHAMPIONSHIPS. And I’m sure James and Monty and @CP3 and @DevinBook wouldn’t have it any other way.@Jumpshot8 @Suns You’re talking about 18 footers like they’re layups. They may be for Durant, but he’s the exception to the rule. Historically the league has not shot those at a high percentage that would value it over a three in the same situation. KD is special.I need to chill on @22wiggins.

Offensive rebound percentage on a 3 goes to 25% from 17% on a mid-range shot = more shots

no one is in favor of passing up open layups for a three like Kemba did the other night. But that’s silliness.

Him and Cp3 should be startingOver the past 10 games, Lebron is averaging 30.7 points. If he stays on this pace,

He'll pass Malone in 17 games on Mar 13, 2022 against the Phoenix Suns.

He'll pass Kareem in 65 games which would be around Dec 23, 2022.No no how can you start Wiggins over Booker? How? Booker has averaged 40+ pts in 2 games and he has led the @Suns to their best record of 38-9. And you start Wiggins over him? Come on @NBA you can do better@RobL_92 @Suns How is Wiggins starting and not Book? It’s BS@Burritoexp @Suns i love the suns because they didn't go out and buy stars but grew them in house showed the association how it is done. #supportlocal #gosuns #goburritoexpress@Xuqar1 @donkeydawg12 @CoachKarl22 @Suns It's non existent to Warriors fans who only just watch their own teamPhoenix Suns have no starter All-Stars this year.@Burritoexp @Suns It’s also my birthday tomorrow 😁 so the tickets would be a fantastic birthday presentMiami Heat - First in the east

Yet Wolves lose by 9 without DLo in the 2nd. No moral victories tho, still took and L and are now back to .500 and have to face the class of the West, the Phoenix Suns tomorrow 😅😅😅Democracy doesn’t work with an uneducated electorate…

A darn shame he’s not listed as a starter for the All-Star game. @Suns watch out, I foresee a 50 point game in the near future! #NBAAllStar@jaymikk So wait… he has another allstar starter on his roster (Phoenix doesn’t even have one), another voted on allstar and future HoF shooter, a defensive MVP front runner. Steph is currently top 5 in MVP race also. 

So all that against-

There are days as a @Suns fan that having him on our team still doesn’t feel real. 
#BookIt #ValleyProud https://t.co/GQrjd4xdH8@Luke_Lyddon @Suns They not smoking… they just not voting for Suns players 🤣Check out this listing I just added to my #Poshmark closet: Phoenix Suns toddler girls shirt, NWT, purple. https://t.co/9uWfOiSwEK #shopmycloset @poshmarkappMy @Suns , who have the best record in the NBA can’t get a Starter in the All Star game BUT Andrew Wiggins can!?!??? #NBAAllStar@Jumpshot8 @Suns @DevinBook @CP3 @NBA Did you see the all star starters announced? Wiggins is on there and NEITHER cp3 nor Book are starters?!Suns Really are out here having the best record in the NBA and not a single starter in the all-star game #NBA75 #NBAAllStar #PhoenixSuns@Jumpshot8 @Suns @DevinBook @CP3 @NBA Still got cooked by a d-league squadYou mean to tell me, not a *single* @Suns player earned a starting nod on the #NBAAllStar team? 

What’re y’all smoking #NBA fans?!@NBA @suns @DevinBook @CP3 #LetThemSleep total disrespect@Jumpshot8 @Suns @DevinBook @CP3 @NBA But do they have culture?The fact that Phoenix is the 5th largest American city is incredible to me. I went to Tucson for 3 days and it was like my face was melting from the sun. ☀️

https://t.co/gyABwxd21SWatching @DevinBook and @CP3 play horse is maybe the best @Suns season ticket perk ever https://t.co/qi7AQiL2BP@ajc23x3 @Suns Whaaaat. We made your burrito with ❤️!! Did you grab a shirt?East? Spot on. 

West? I get that “positions” matter when it comes to voting, but no Phoenix Suns, a team with the best record in the whole league, starting is a crime.

I wouldn’t even really argue with Andrew Wiggins as a reserve, but Devin Booker should be a starter. https://t.co/nqgr6eojrq@KevinFoote17 @Suns Love me a lil Al McCoy!!!!We need two players currently on Philly. Maxey and Thybulle! Let’s get these trades poppin @Suns@Burritoexp @Suns Al McCoy…@pc3hotcity @Jiggy602 @Dbacks @FitoFloresAZ @Suns Ballers!📊 NBA ELO Ratings for January 27, 2022
