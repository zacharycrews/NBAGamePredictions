@BensHoops #TakeNote https://t.co/Kc9JeFGbrQ@voltron183 @MugiwaraNoSxtn @kirkgoldsberry @rudygobert27 @utahjazz Gobert is fake
Just look at his defensive rating
Last yr reg szn: 100.5
Last yr playoffs: 117
That's a crazy slide. This trend can be seen through his whole career. He gets killed by small ball. 

Other dpoys ( giannis,Draymond,etc ) stay the same or get better come playoffs.First visit from the Blazers

#TakeNote https://t.co/hMEW2hdPb7Since drafting Damian Lillard, the Trail Blazers have a 7-11 record when playing the Utah Jazz on the road.

@joecapraro gives us an inside look at the odds for tonight's matchup:
https://t.co/Y5XUymqxVy@Jazzfan27 @YahooSportsNBA @SloanImperative @utahjazz I literally just explained to you “the process” of what happened. That was great situational offense by Ingles. Jazz will always be happy with Ingles taking open 3s like that. Go get your eyes checked.@dawsonsmeek Utah jazz used to cover the spread all the time. ..theyre cleaning out my wallet this yearUtah Jazz vs Portland Trail Blazers 11/29/2021 NBA Picks, Predictions, Odds » Sports Chat Place https://t.co/JX9HvB9cZK #NBA #NBAPick #FreePick #FreePicks #SportsBetting #ExpertPick #NBATwitter  #ExpertBettingAdvice #BettingTipster #Handicapper #SportsGambling #takenote #ripcity https://t.co/pmqr04WzhX@RizingFallacy @MugiwaraNoSxtn @kirkgoldsberry @rudygobert27 @utahjazz Mobley plays more minutes than Gobert and puts up worse numbers in every single category. 

Mobley doesn’t make the Jazz better. He’s a legit player and that’s great for Cleveland to have him, but he’s not better than the 3x DPOY. His future is bright though.Today's NBA Picks: 9:10 PM ET - Portland Trail Blazers vs. Utah Jazz - 14 PICKS AVAILABLE: https://t.co/ueDyAIpCMA #nba@voltron183 @MugiwaraNoSxtn @kirkgoldsberry @rudygobert27 @utahjazz Put mobley on the jazz and mobley would do the same if not better 

Imagine if gobert was running the floor with Lauri, sexton and Allen
Can u comprehend how ass gobert and the team would be??

As for Reb, ofc mobley gets way less rebounds. 2 other bigs are taking his rebs@voltron183 @RizingFallacy @kirkgoldsberry @rudygobert27 @utahjazz Bah you just need to relax lmao no real people on internet honestly think that stat means Mobley better@arashisonline @AjayRajshekar @kirkgoldsberry @rudygobert27 @utahjazz What the hell is Rudy Gay supposed to do?@RizingFallacy @MugiwaraNoSxtn @kirkgoldsberry @rudygobert27 @utahjazz So Mobley guards two more shots per game and that makes him better? You do realize many guys stop themselves from taking shots just because Gobert is in the neighborhood? Gobert is going to win his 4th DPOY trophy because he’s simply the best at at. Plus his grab 2x the reboundsGameday! (21/82)

#NBA75 #TakeNote https://t.co/X7J8pr5aI5@HotRodDunkin @kirkgoldsberry @rudygobert27 @utahjazz That would be the minor concern ya. Closest defender data is kind of messy sometimes@McCadeP8 @kirkgoldsberry @rudygobert27 @utahjazz As Rudy blocked them. And I guess does this take into account of help blocks not where he was the primary defender@HotRodDunkin @kirkgoldsberry @rudygobert27 @utahjazz As in Rudy blocked 44 of shots of those 370?

Or as in Rudy got 17 of his 145 shots blocked?@voltron183 @kirkgoldsberry @rudygobert27 @utahjazz Not the stat I’m talking about@jazzwithtaz Utah Jazz has to still be the worst combo.When they was scared to get it thru the mailman...

Some of it was perimeter breakdowns - guys didn't rotate to corners. But having Gobert stand by the paint and watch open 3PA after open 3PA doesn't help.@trailblazers @utahjazz @vivintarena @RipCityRadio620 Dear Blazers, you are loved.

The nbas Phoenix Suns lead with 31 playoff failures without a championship. Somehow those team avoid criticism or any mention of their deed?.....@AustinClayton4 @YahooSportsNBA @SloanImperative @utahjazz I see a play with little movement, no passing, a guy pounding the ball, and a lucky shot bailing the whole thing out.  Entire thing looked bad to me other than the ball going in.  But if you just look at the process and not the result, that looks like bad basketball by my eye.https://t.co/fwj3dwgEuU
