The Chicago Bulls have lost 5 straight &amp; have a horrible record vs. the best teams in the league…

Golden State without Draymond = 15-16

The impact Draymond brings though to the Warriors is huge. Without him, they lose in the 1st Round just like the Bulls will lose in the 1st Round without Caruso/Lonzo.Charlotte Hornets - Brooklyn Nets
