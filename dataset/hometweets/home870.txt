"mecca of basketball" how many of the great players in the last 30 years came from new york city? 2 or 3? stop it please. bc u damn sure can't make the argument based off of actual success from the teams 😭@dvrkyyxo @Petetree16 @hornets You from New York smh get out of here you bandwagon bozo lmao. Go root for the Knicks or Nets or something.@MrTopNews1 @hhpthebook @nyknicks Tired is nothing but a sorry ass excuse for an inefficient, low IQ player.

let's stop acting like he doesn't come up as a choker in nearly every crunchtime moment as a Knick. Can't call him tired everytime. Sometimes u just gota say HE AINT THAT GUY!@KnicksFanTv   Memphis has a backup better than any @nyknicks PG 🥺
#KnicksTank https://t.co/PcIN0i9qVV@iamremyD @matthewlee_3 @wyshynski Or Dallas (NFL)..Or Washington, DC {NFL), Or New York City (NBA Knicks). .Or Ottawa (NHL).  Or Phoenix (NHL). But by all means complain about a Montréal owner who thinks his coach should be able to communicate with the fans and media in their languageAnother pg @nyknicks could have had. He has helped turn Minnesota into a playoff team. https://t.co/gQohFlwePu@ThatsJusAce @nyknicks Chill@nyknicks @JCrossover The Knicks won’t be good again until the court is painted orange.  The blue is so fugly@travbryanmusic Sometimes I wake up to the news that the Dolans no longer own @nyknicks but then I realize it’s just a dream 🥲James Dolan will let me buy the @nyknicks when I turn 40If it were only that simple, Julius Randle is not that guy but Thibbs is stuck in the same spin cycle of being unable to change what isn’t working putting the @nyknicks in the same bad situation each night. https://t.co/maRFHE9hxbNew York Knicks lack of defense putting Tom Thibodeau in a precarious position #SmartNews Rose and Thibodeau both should be let go.  https://t.co/6Koh6Y5AptIn Game 58 of the 2021-2022 #NewYork #Knicks #NationalBasketballAssociation Season, played on #February 14, 2022, The New York Knicks lost to The #OklahomaCity #Thunder; The New York Knicks record is now: 25-33 https://t.co/5jbBlmFXuD@hhpthebook @nyknicks Randle is found to try and do to much all the time but I also have to point out the fact that he was tired as well. Too Tired Randle wanting to be The Lone Ranger. Had he had a little more respect for his teammates game their might have been a different outcome as well.There is literally no joy in being a @nyknicks fan. It’s just utter humiliation and frustration year after year and I’m so over it. #NewYorkForever@livelikelefty you bring an old school coach who plays the elderly no matter what and you want to develop a young team? Mitch is still clueless except for dunking, IQ is worse this year than last, there is no development of talent. Just a @nyknicks yearly shit show with a promise of next season@nyknicks @JCrossover We stink but I love my boys man!Everything RIGHT With The New York KNICKS

My happy rant about the #knicks ⁦@nyknicks⁩@eddiecaine @nyknicks Growing up the Yankees hat was part of my NY uniform. Yankees fitted, white T , jeans and Timbs@histlrngr @KnicksWinPls @nyknicks He's not getting another coaching gig. Dude has been black balled from the league.  Kill that pipe dream@nyknicks @TheGarden @nyknicks your PR staff should know better than putting this garbage out.. then top it with the 💪🏾 emoji..  it’s annoying and embarrassing when we DID NOT WIN! Fire who running the social media cause they’re TERRIBLEWhile Tom Thibodeau’s seat in New York is warming up, Ime Udoka and Jason Kidd are thriving in Boston and Dallas. Thibodeau beat Udoka and Kidd for the Knicks job.New York Knicks: Episode 564: A New Low https://t.co/cfljMKzlOw@nyknicks @TheGarden Why show this? It’s pointless if we lost… you know we’re bad when we trying to find the silver lining in a game that shouldn’t have been close.I really really want to go to the @MiamiHEAT vs @nyknicks game the 25th 😩@livern_barrett @LakeShow1900 @nyknicks @Lakers @bumnation Lol kmt@ESPNNBA @stephenasmith @stephenasmith mind your dam business worry about making your @nyknicks relevant. Leave @AntDavis23 and my @Lakers alone.@NYsports1810 @nyknicks Yea im with you. We need to get IQ back to his best self, need to let Cam develop &amp; need to play obi more (give randle more of a breather). All these things will help us win. The only vet that deserves consistent minutes is evan.@playoffpbball @nyknicks But they should stop playing kemba Burks Noel Taj and focus on the young guys. They can’t lose anymore than they already are, plus it will help figure out who’s apart of the futureI can’t believe elfrid Payton gonna make the playoffs before our beloved New York Knicks 🤦🏿‍♂️🤦🏿‍♂️🤦🏿‍♂️🤦🏿‍♂️📣 New Podcast!

Dude dribbles to nowhere most of the time.@sambox71 @nyknicks IQ picks up his dribble because he doesn't have a plan. It drives me crazy@hhpthebook @nyknicks Those jump passes kill me. IQ has been doing that lately too.@Knickloyalty @nyknicks Where winning was concerned yes!!! Defensively it is evident and offensively we aren’t much better than last season@SwiftWitRage @nyknicks I agree@sambox71 @nyknicks It's sad. Randle was playing a two man game with Fournier.  Even Monica McNutt said why is Randle spinning and passing. Wally kept saying it...Randle doesn't have a plan of what to do with the ball until he's up off his feet.he is lazy he plays on the New York  knicks#BATTLE#OF#THE#BOROUGHS#NEW#YORK#KNICKS#VS#BROOKLYN#NETS https://t.co/jYax3K0XPb via @YouTube@ajtaldii @nyknicks and then they lost@hhpthebook @nyknicks On every planet (including Earth) 11/26 is 15 misses.  Add the 7 turnovers and that’s 22 wasted opportunities…and we lost by 4 points.  The “fans” need to put his numbers in perspective. 1/5 and 4 turnovers to close the game….

Freeze him out after a great 1st half. He'll have 3 shot attempts for the rest of the game.

Grimes was on fire. Its the 2nd game where they went away from Grimes in the 4th. Also, he tried to win the game, again.. why? He's not a good ball handler when he's not tired. So bruh, why? Know your limits.@NYIslanders It’s so close between who a more dislikable team is between you and the @nyknicks@hhpthebook @nyknicks Burks was just as tired. I believe at that point he had played in 10 straight minutes.@TimAlle42886212 @ProjectNerdHQ @RGT_85 @nyknicks Nah no thanks@allanfajardo29 New York Rangers(hockey) , New York Knicks (Baloncesto) o New York Red Bulls (soccer).@SarahSpain New York Knicks fans' preseason expectations meet regular season reality.

(I'm a Knicks fan.)yo @nyknicks pass this tweet to Thibs https://t.co/mi2kM8uTLRElfrid Payton was the starting Pg for a 4th seeded playoff team last season. That team was the @nyknicks@sambox71 @nyknicks That's why I said "Get off the ball"@hhpthebook @nyknicks Being fatigued does lead to turnovers.Listen, some of yall are saying the @nyknicks lost last night because Thibs played the starters too many minutes, and they were tired. Soooooooo, were just going to gloss over Randles Turnovers in the 4th Q? If he was tired..  then, get off the ball and let the Guards set up! SMH@NYCeaseleo 😂🤣🤣😂 it’s sad bro. Julis Randle is the best Player on The NEW YORK KNICKS.

Just all their stars are still out. But it doesn’t take much to beat the Knicks these days. Big games from Seth and Drummond could be enough.@Btruetolife 1 of 2.  C'mon bro, we all know @drose wanted the bright lights of the @nyknicks market to silence idiots in media who declared him "washed up" &amp; more recently "just a role player" (per @TheFrankIsola)
