Now I think you‚Äôre right to point out that being patient could pay off this offseason (see: Deandre Ayton), but I still wouldn‚Äôt mind them adding Poeltl in the offseason.

I bet they‚Äôd want at least a decent player + a 1st (or young player).Ayton in Charlotte is something I‚Äôve been enamored with for a few months now.

https://t.co/TyRIIopKoqUnless the Hornets can grab Nurkic for cheap or Kupchak has had a change of heart on Richaun Holmes, expect Charlotte to make a smaller move for a Robin Lopez or Nerlens Noel type player. Or quite possibly nothing at all. #AllFlyThe @hornets need to make a move before the deadline, and there are a few pretty good options. 

One guy I think makes sense is Spurs C Jakob Poeltl - a real rim protector. 6th in Blocks (1.7) and averaging 13/9/3 on 61% shooting and Top 40 in efficiency. Very affordable too.Want to be on TV?

PJ is same height as Morris, only 10ths lighter, shoots the ball better, AND IS AVAILABLE TO PLAY.

https://t.co/OqDLGg8cQQThe Charlotte Hornets are 22nd in offensive rating over the past 10 games, Why?

A sudden drop in three point efficiency, Charlotte rank 29th in 3PT shooting over the last 10 games at 30%, you can see slide has been universal across all types of shots. https://t.co/MEOSIkBv8RNBA Basketball Game Betting Picks Simulator: 7:40 PM ET - Chicago Bulls vs. Charlotte Hornets - YOU CAN RUN THE GAME SIMULATION FOR FREE HERE: https://t.co/AVBbyqjThl #nba #sportsbetting #freepicks #cappertek@hornets @Ticketmaster Y'all not going to win another,Fire y'all coach first.Chicago Bulls vs  Charlotte Hornets Prediction 2/9/22 -  Free NBA Picks https://t.co/i8DbZOOjLA via @YouTube

No smoke? No fire? We might not see a trade.@hunterbutler @hornets @HusqvarnaUSA No on firing Mitch if he doesn't trade for a big.  First there may not be an upgrade big available, and second even if there is one available, the price may be too high because the Hornets do not have a lot of desirable assets to trade for a big.

This is a ball handling and shot selection issue.  When the Hornets take care of the ball, take good shots, play a little defense, they can beat anyone with the big men they have as has been proven this year.üèÄChicago Bulls #BullsNation vs Charlotte Hornets #AllFly‚åöÔ∏è7:30PM üñ•Bally Sports SouthEast #NBA75 #NBA https://t.co/1TD7pd3TRq1 day away from the #NBATradeDeadline will the Charlotte Hornets be active and make a trade today or tomorrow? #AllFlyYUGE show coming up:
