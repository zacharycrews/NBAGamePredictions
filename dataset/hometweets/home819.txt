Thanks to @Cmd_Guap1 for his helpful advice with this one https://t.co/siP0glyTzg@HVTWpodcast @ShamsCharania There is just simply no trade that makes sense for Charlotte because the only players I’m seeing being talked about are players not even in your rotation… I get that Yurt has looked good but that just makes zero sense in any way for the Hornets.Joined next by @adamamin to preview @Hornets and @chicagobulls tonight.

We'll wait to see the severity of it.@KyleBaileyClub @hornets Let’s do it.@CzechPanther @dapper_sports @hornets They don’t need to rebuild though. They need to add a piece. Now I think you’re right to point out that being patient could pay off this offseason (see: Deandre Ayton), but I still wouldn’t mind them adding Poeltl in the offseason. Good young player who fits a clear need.This month, @BankofAmerica will partner with the @hornets to host their 2nd annual innovation summit, providing opportunities for local minority-owned businesses. Great to see this program back in 2022!

https://t.co/J6apEq85d2@KyleBaileyClub @hornets What am I missing about Vernon Carey Jr? Is he a player or not? JB needs to lean on the youth and figure out who wants to be the man.@KyleBaileyClub @dapper_sports @hornets Do they really need to do anything THIS year?

His contract.@KyleBaileyClub @hornets Affordable as in his contract? Because I doubt Spurs are giving him away cheap. I bet they’d want at least a decent player + a 1st (or young player).Ayton in Charlotte is something I’ve been enamored with for a few months now. The Hornets would be wise to monitor that situation closely. #Suns #Hornets https://t.co/XER5fBlz3oCan @hornets swing Buddy &amp; Turner? https://t.co/rddwcO1XoxPlease get Richaun Holmes @hornetsWith All-Star weekend at our fingertips, @CCUGeneral2016 takes a trip to the past and reflects on former @hornets All-Stars. #NBATwitter 
https://t.co/TyRIIopKoqUnless the Hornets can grab Nurkic for cheap or Kupchak has had a change of heart on Richaun Holmes, expect Charlotte to make a smaller move for a Robin Lopez or Nerlens Noel type player. Or quite possibly nothing at all. #AllFlyThe @hornets need to make a move before the deadline, and there are a few pretty good options. 

One guy I think makes sense is Spurs C Jakob Poeltl - a real rim protector. 6th in Blocks (1.7) and averaging 13/9/3 on 61% shooting and Top 40 in efficiency. Very affordable too.Want to be on TV?

Hornets are 0-6 ATS in their last 6 home games
Hornets are 8-3 ATS in their last 11 games as a home dog@chubbinatub @NC_Coder @hornets Melo is the only untouchable player on the hornets. Saying you won’t include Kai in anything is wild.@yandy_roman @BradyHawk305 PJ Washington would be a back up 4. Hoping Morris+KZ is enough for charlotte. PJ is same height as Morris, only 10ths lighter, shoots the ball better, AND IS AVAILABLE TO PLAY. Hopefully adding KZ to the deal makes it more appealing to Hornets + adds cap space.Cant wait to watch @AyoDos_11 play against the @hornets tonight. Can then officially say ive watched him in person play in high school, college and now NBA!@chubbinatub @hornets You may be able to remove the future 1st and get by with it@hornets @LendingTree Y'all matching up Plumlee to Vucevic like we wouldn't notice btw Vucevic would dominate him LMFAO.Now they had yesterday off and take a big step down in class here.  The Charlotte Hornets are really struggling right now.  They are 0-5 SU &amp; 1-4 ATS in their last five games overall with several blowout losses.  They lost by 25 at home to the Clippers, by 18 at home to the Heat@chubbinatub @hornets Wood is only 25 and is a legit double double center with a 3 shot.@NC_Coder @hornets No chance I’m giving up that much. I’m not including Kai in anything. He’s gonna be a legit future piece.Working in charlotte then bulls vs hornets. My squad better come thru!@hornets @LendingTree trade@hornets should trade for Wood. Makes them an immediate contender. PJ, Kai, NO 1st, and protected future 1st.@hornets @LendingTree Mason is gonna have a hard match up tonight@hornets gone head and snag him and Myles Turner https://t.co/5zxnniBe1qNikola Vucevic o20.5 points -118 (1u)

Charlotte has a very bad presence in the paint, giving up the 2nd most points to opposing centers. Earlier this season Vs Charlotte, he had 30 points. Last year vs the Hornets, he cleared this line 3 out of 4 games..@macwfnz and @TBoneWFNZ talk to @WilliePStyle about his favorite pizza and the latest around Charlotte FC, discuss the latest around ACC basketball @PaulBiancardi and look at how the Hornets can recover from the loss of Gordon Hayward.

No smoke? No fire? We might not see a trade.@hunterbutler @hornets @HusqvarnaUSA No on firing Mitch if he doesn't trade for a big.  First there may not be an upgrade big available, and second even if there is one available, the price may be too high because the Hornets do not have a lot of desirable assets to trade for a big.

This is a ball handling and shot selection issue.  When the Hornets take care of the ball, take good shots, play a little defense, they can beat anyone with the big men they have as has been proven this year.🏀Chicago Bulls #BullsNation vs Charlotte Hornets #AllFly⌚️7:30PM 🖥Bally Sports SouthEast #NBA75 #NBA https://t.co/1TD7pd3TRq1 day away from the #NBATradeDeadline will the Charlotte Hornets be active and make a trade today or tomorrow? #AllFlyYUGE show coming up:
