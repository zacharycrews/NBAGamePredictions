“Starting at shooting guard for the Milwaukee Bucks… Ray Allen!” https://t.co/4BlpJlrNml@AdamMcGee11 You can tell a non-Milwaukee based Bucks faan by their hatred of cream &amp; the Cream City moniker.

🎥: IG petedonahoephoto, IG keniashoots https://t.co/VvAYH2QP7Y@Raiders @heykayadams She’s also an Astros, Braves and Milwaukee bucks fan I believe…LOS ANGELES (AFP) — Giannis Antetokounmpo finished with 30 points, 10 rebounds and nine assists, and the Milwaukee Bucks led by as much as 18 points en route to a 119-109 win over the mistake-prone Indiana Pacers.
