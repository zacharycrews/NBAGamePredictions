#Spurs #BullsNation #Live #NBAAllStar https://t.co/2ZekwFp65QDeMar DeRozan returns to San Antonio as an All-Star, an honor he never earned with the Spurs. But he thinks he gained something here, and he's proving SA was right to believe in him. https://t.co/BLO7InQaFn via @expressnewsCrazy to think last time the Bulls played in San Antonio the Spurs blitzed Lavine + Vooch. Well now we got Demar so…Respect runs deep between Gregg Popovich and DeMar DeRozan, who shared three seasons in San Antonio

"I found him to be one of my favorite guys of all time," Popovich said of DeRozan ahead of Bulls-Spurs. "He’s superhuman in every way, shape and form.”
