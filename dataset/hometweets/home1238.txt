A huge contrast in styles here, as the Sixers' star power &amp; interior presence goes against the speed-you-up defense of the Raps. OG Anunoby &amp; Fred VanVleet are difference-makers if healthy -- on both ends

Prediction: Raptors in 7 https://t.co/iq4m4KFpOIFor clarification, and despite what you may see on my Twitter feed suggesting otherwise, I *hate* the Philadelphia 76ers.⚡ NEW in 🏀 from the 76ers [#PhilaUnite]
