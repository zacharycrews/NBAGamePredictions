Rip City, thank you for all the kind words these past two weeks. It was a blast ❤️🖤@lakerdoge @BrianRHolmes @trailblazers @Joeingles7 @Dame_Lillard He’s not wrong. LA was lucky enough to get Lebron just because it’s a big market. That’ll never happen to small markets like Portland and Milwaukee. It’s easier for big markets and that’s why when you have guys like Dame and Giannis who commit to a small franchise it’s great@BrianRHolmes @trailblazers @Joeingles7 @Dame_Lillard Tbh when Kobe wanted to be traded in 07, I was like 11-12 years old so I can't relate, I'll admit. But in the end, Kobe chose to trust in his franchise who eventually gave him Pau... Idk bro I understand it's hard to admit but you know your f.o ain't it@trailblazers Build around HartTONIGHT...

I know it's been a long time since you've even smelled greatness, you probably weren't even born in 77. All good brother, good times will come. Maybe Anfernee Simons will get u there LMFAOOOO@lakerdoge @trailblazers @Joeingles7 A ring in the Bubble 😂😂… but I get it… a ring is a ring.

Portland Trail Blazers https://t.co/zKhTiNOOip@whytefolks1 @trailblazers @joshhart It’s very easy for a player in New Orleans to be beloved. All they have to do is try hard and love the community and the community will show its support and do that 10-fold. From his Players Tribune article, I’m sure the feelings will be mutual. Josh Hart is the same way.Mark this down @trailblazers fans. At the end of his career, even if its on a one-day contract, @CJMcCollum will retire a Blazer. #CJMcCollum #ThankYouCJ #3J #RipCity@yankeesman77 @trailblazers @joshhart Damn y’all will definitely be a problem when he’s back and CJ gets acclimated to the team.

Joe Ingles is an amazing person with passion for the game and the community. He is a big part of the Jazz success. Your gain and a huge lost for us. I will always be a big fan and Utah will always keep you in our hearts….❤️So sad@whytefolks1 @trailblazers @joshhart Getting his body and conditioning in order… Otherwise, he’s up in the PNW right now. Hoping he’ll be back within the next month or so. He was supposed to be back in December but the bone in his foot wasn’t healing the right way.A new Portland Trail Blazer learns very, very quickly you do not ask the citizens of Portland for coffee recommendations.

After nine seasons in Portland, CJ McCollum officially says goodbye. 

Even a few days after CJ McCollum has left the Portland Trail Blazers, reality has… https://t.co/FYhuQlkHMW #RipCity https://t.co/xQ1dxuxulz@nd0rian Yes.  The Pelicans  just got one amazing ball player and a heck of a good moral man.  Good luck CJ - We are so going to miss you in Portland but we wish you the best. Congratulations to New Orleans. 

@CJMcCollum  @PelicansNBA @trailblazersForever a Portland Trail Blazer. Love ya CJ, aka 3J, aka Special Victims Unit.

#ripcity https://t.co/q8AJHAHFbc@trailblazers I got emotional eventhough I am a Laker fan. God bless you CJ!@JingIesss Solid troll by @trailblazers I have to admit.@trailblazers Welp I'm sobbing now@trailblazers @OrlandoMagic Just 2 front offices saying “how about never!” to their fan bases. So beautiful and inspiring@AaronMitchy @Joeingles7 @trailblazers Will it stay torn forever?

I honestly think he will take whatever contract he has to to get back there too, but while he’s in Portland I’m gonna enjoy it cause ingles is the kinda player you hate going against but love on your team lol I just wish he was healthy so I could see him in action!@Joeingles7 @trailblazers Not happy seeing this. 

But I wish you the best @Joeingles7@eBlanton77 @mppockrus @izzyb412 @Joeingles7 @trailblazers I think we are sometimes people just wanna argue 😂 so I’m like screw let’s argue like I’m talking to my wife 🤣 I hope ingles stays in Portland but he belongs in UTAH ❤️@ANTSZNNN @trailblazers @elijahhughes4_ @Joeingles7 Hope that it happens, and it’s not a Gasol sort of thing.@McilvainMatt @mppockrus @izzyb412 @Joeingles7 @trailblazers That’s the only way it makes sense to me anyone cause I feel like we are all saying the same thing lol@McilvainMatt @mppockrus @izzyb412 @Joeingles7 @trailblazers I think this guy thought you meant Portland had the right to sign him above anyone else like Portland has first dibs on him or something, like a restricted free agent, not that we have the right to go above salary of most teams like what actual bird rights are. Just confused😂Thank you so much @CJMcCollum. A @trailblazers legend. https://t.co/8UoWIb2CCn https://t.co/e9PkJnrP5I@trailblazers @joshhart As A Pelicans Fan #WBD

Always Hart &amp; Always Love ❤️@mppockrus @eBlanton77 @izzyb412 @Joeingles7 @trailblazers Repeating everything I said does that make it easier for you too understand? The point in all of this is Portland has the right to offer him the bests contract does he have too take it no he does not if money isn’t important too himThis is beautiful.  I'll miss you as a Trail Blazer @CJMcCollum 

Dear Portland
https://t.co/jgCdt3HIKk@eBlanton77 @mppockrus @izzyb412 @Joeingles7 @trailblazers That’s what they are he doesn’t have to take the offer but if he wants to get the most money Portland can offer him that above any other team@Joeingles7 @trailblazers Light a fire under Nurks ass like only you can do Mr. Ingles! https://t.co/bNuXuyq8gU@trailblazers Hot mess bawling...right now@chargrrs @trailblazers @elijahhughes4_ @Joeingles7 Well he had a media day and we have his bird right so inshAllah we can see him kicking it for us in the playoffs of 2023@mppockrus @McilvainMatt @izzyb412 @Joeingles7 @trailblazers I thought he meant the right to sign them above anyone else in in higher salary. That’s where I was confused when you said that’s not what they are I thought, that’s exactly what they are, a tool to let a team offer more money than anyone else. That was my argument anyway@eBlanton77 @McilvainMatt @izzyb412 @Joeingles7 @trailblazers Having an additional incentive ≠ “having the right to sign a player above anyone else.” Full stop. Lol. I’m done with this convo.The @trailblazers dramatically reshaped its roster during the NBA trade deadline. So, who’d we get?
https://t.co/6LXu0bfYid@eBlanton77 @McilvainMatt @izzyb412 @Joeingles7 @trailblazers Yeah of course. Not arguing that. But my original point was that this person said bird rights “give a team the right to sign a player above anyone else” and that’s 100% false.

Also I don’t think the blazers will want Joe enough to offer him enough $ to stay, but 🤷🏻‍♂️The one game I’m most excited to have @trailblazers tickets for the rest of the season is 3/30 to welcome @CJMcCollum back@ANTSZNNN @trailblazers @elijahhughes4_ @Joeingles7 Sadly think you’re right. He’d be an awesome addition if they could make it happen.@elijahhughes4_ @trailblazers We’re happy that you’re happy https://t.co/fIno3F5TI0@mppockrus @eBlanton77 @izzyb412 @Joeingles7 @trailblazers U never know bird rights could be the only reason he stays in Portland if money is what he wants and a guy towards the end of his career could wanna earn as much as possible u never know coming off his injury teams prolly won’t offer him much@mppockrus @McilvainMatt @izzyb412 @Joeingles7 @trailblazers But that is Exactly what bird rights ARE, a tool to help a team keep a player by offering more money, that’s not arguable@mppockrus @McilvainMatt @izzyb412 @Joeingles7 @trailblazers Lol so you’re arguing he doesn’t care about money, Not that bird rights don’t help. Bird rights certainly help team retain free agents with offering more money. Will it help with Joe, depends what HE wants I bet he goes back to Utah, however Portland can still offer more money.@Joeingles7 @trailblazers Joe, listen to me, we are going to find a way.  Be patient.  Don’t give up on us yet. #TakeNote https://t.co/tooGrgpocJ@eBlanton77 @McilvainMatt @izzyb412 @Joeingles7 @trailblazers Exactly. All bird rights do is allow teams to incentivize re-signing by giving teams the option to offer more $. But all the bird rights in the world can’t keep an UFA from leaving, and bird rights won’t keep Joe in Portland. Maybe he stays, but it won’t be b/c bird rights. Lol@mppockrus @McilvainMatt @izzyb412 @Joeingles7 @trailblazers If the blazer really want to bring him back they can offer him as much money as they want to try and bring him back. Now will they do that? Probably not but they CAN if they really wanted. Like you said it’s up to Joe but money helps a decision sometimes@mppockrus @izzyb412 @eBlanton77 @Joeingles7 @trailblazers They allow a team to offer him better incentives and a longer contract so if he values money at this stage in his career Portland would be his best option if he doesn’t it doesn’t matter@eBlanton77 @McilvainMatt @izzyb412 @Joeingles7 @trailblazers “Sign him above anyone else” and “offer him more money” are not the same thing, particular with a player like Joe, who will be coming off a serious injury and be in his mid-30s. Offering more money is only valuable if he’s worth that money to a team.@mppockrus @McilvainMatt @izzyb412 @Joeingles7 @trailblazers “Bird Rights were included in the CBA to allow teams to be able to re-sign their star players under the new cap rules. In the simplest terms, Bird Rights enable teams to incentivize players to re-sign by allowing that team to offer higher salaries than their competitors”You are even more amazing to write this for us @CJMcCollum - you have been so great for Portland on court and beyond the @trailblazers and we wish you all the best - plus it’s not good bye it’s see you soon! We look forward to welcoming you and your family back to #RipCity ❤️🖤🤍 https://t.co/GsYfnCYgjKI haven’t actually legitimately cried reading a sports article in a long time. Thank you @CJMcCollum. Gonna have to buy me a @PelicansNBA jersey now. Go @trailblazers. https://t.co/JoTAxMyax5@McilvainMatt @izzyb412 @eBlanton77 @Joeingles7 @trailblazers I doubt that competition will be there for post-ACL Joe ingles, and Joe is unlikely to be chasing money at that point in his career anyway. At any rate, bird rights do not “give a team the right to sign a player above anybody else.”Wow. What a great letter written by CJ. Thank you @CJMcCollum Thanks to Joe Cronin for handling things this way. Makes me proud to be a @trailblazers fan. https://t.co/JZhs74Q1Kg@Joeingles7 @trailblazers Wishing you all the best in your rehab Joe and hoping you can bounce back to top form with the Trailblazers.  Brutal business the NBA!! Here's hoping your family also settles well into Portland.@McilvainMatt @izzyb412 @eBlanton77 @Joeingles7 @trailblazers A team with bird rights allow a team to offer a returning player (or a player whose contract has been traded) more money without it counting against the salary cap. Bird rights aren’t valuable unless there’s a lot of competition to sign a particular player.@mppockrus @McilvainMatt @izzyb412 @Joeingles7 @trailblazers Unless I’m mistaken that’s exactly what bird rights are, with what you just said, go to a team with more money. Portland has his bird rights meaning they can go over the cap to sign him, giving him more money than some teams. They did it this last summer with norm Powell.@mppockrus @izzyb412 @eBlanton77 @Joeingles7 @trailblazers Do you understand how bird rights work?I’m gonna need @CJMcCollum to retire a @trailblazers player.   One way or the other.

Except ingles is at the end of his career so who knows what’s important to him@Joeingles7 @trailblazers Now it feels real. Now it hurts double.
