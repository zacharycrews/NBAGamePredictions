I really hope your efforts pay offGive me Kelly Oubre, Hayward and Scary Terry for that trash ass fashionova model @hornets@C0WYS2 @NolimitImraan @sakatierney45 That‚Äôs not what‚Äôs happening here. It‚Äôs just the situation of the Hornets currently. If this came to fruition, we have LaMelo. Charlotte isn‚Äôt handing the keys to Russ when LaMelo is placing his Ferrari in the same parking garage.i‚Äôm sorry but no. I love russ but don‚Äôt break this squad up pls @hornets https://t.co/1rkvKUIjdB@JustEsBaraheni The Lakers need this trade more than the Hornets. Don‚Äôt see Charlotte involving Rozier at all. They like him.don‚Äôt do it @hornets@NafrmdaV @hornets They're trying to dig themselves out of the mess of Hayward and Rozier‚Äôs contracts. It wouldn't be for Westbrook‚Äôs talent; he's an expiring. Lakers would be stupid to give up $48M in salary relief without getting prospects in returnDon‚Äôt even think about it @Jumpman23  @hornets https://t.co/W4Ee6aI7LT@hornets  if y‚Äôall trade for westbrick , Watch and sit back the fans you‚Äôll lose@Blind_Vigilante @hornets Nah get him out of a Lakers jersey please!! We don't want him!!! üòÇ@KyleBaileyClub @hornets I don‚Äôt see MJ paying that salary for a player like Russ.@takeoffurcool @hornets Lmaoooo@hornets if you guys do this to Lamelo I will never forgive you. https://t.co/p05Won60dd@lowry_talk @hornets üòÇüòÇüòÇ keeping it real bro@hornets since y‚Äôall want Westbrook we gon need rozier and bridges y‚Äôall can have tht and 27‚Äô pick.@NataTheScribe @KyleBaileyClub @hornets Only reason we make this trade is if they take Hayward‚Äôs contract and keep the cap hit from Russ. 

Also seems like moving PJ would not be the worst move in the world since we need to get ready for Bridges contract and Harrell.@hornets @HornetsPR for the sake of your rising stars, vibe, and current projections, please do aquire Russell Westbrook. That is all. #GoHornets@KyleBaileyClub @hornets Why do teams keep thinking they can fix him? The lakers better pay his salary and throw in like 3 firsts.@KyleBaileyClub @hornets I mean we have a history of making terrible trades with the Lakers‚Ä¶ https://t.co/igAhiFMynu@takeoffurcool @hornets WhatI‚Äôm hearing some stuff I don‚Äôt like and I want y‚Äôall to know..don‚Äôt you fckin dare do that @hornets@KyleBaileyClub @hornets I would fight everybody in the front office, if they did this dumbüí©@hornets plz do not go after westbrick, plz.So the Charlotte Hornets have decided they don‚Äôt want to make the #NBAPlayoffs next season? https://t.co/O6K1OqRO02@kwarninthemorn @Eternity9 There is no such thing as a LaMelo Stan it is either Hornets fans that wants the Hornets to become contenders, actually Lamelo fans that wants the Hornets Melo team to be successful and the Lakers fans posing as Lamelo fans that wants Melo time in Charlotte be a failure.@hornets do NOT bring Russ to fucking Charlotte@KyleBaileyClub @hornets I hope not, but he *is* MJ's favorite player.@washedwiz @hornets @Jumpman23 Will be a great day for long time Charlotte residents like me if the Hornets can pull this offToday's NBA Picks: 7:00 PM ET - Orlando Magic vs. Charlotte Hornets - 17 PICKS AVAILABLE: https://t.co/vez847cWI7 #nba@KyleBaileyClub @hornets I get where you're coming from, but if this means you keep PJ AND get future financial flexibility, it makes a lot of sense.

Actual deal: "Lakers are sending G Russell Westbrook to the Charlotte Hornets for a future 2nd round pick, F Cody Martin and C Mason Plumlee" https://t.co/sd65YuUrDs@PanthersCulture As a laker fan living in charlotte, HARD PASS hornets. Trust me. 

First of all, Russ value has never been lower. He‚Äôs overpaid, aging out of his freak athleticism, &amp; never developed other tools like lebron, Kd, Kobe, etc. 

2ndly, he won‚Äôt come off the bench.
