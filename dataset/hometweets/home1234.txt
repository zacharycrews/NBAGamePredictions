Loss - A 1st Rd pick in next draft pick #14

I'm a huge cavs fan &amp; want us to Win but only if J Allen can play in 1st Rd.

Without him Cavs got no shot vs Mia in 1st Rd..

It be better to get the 14th pick...

-Give up 105 points or less
-Levert and Lauri need to combine for 30
-Cedi and Love need to combine for 25

If those happen we need 51 points from Garland, Allen, Mobley and the rest, which will happen.

Can’t wait to see where this core goes@gabbgoudy @cavs I like that their name has alliteration with Cleveland, and their colors. I also like Jared Allen’s Afro and Kevin Love’s mental toughness and his smile. I like the new identity we are forming and I like how much fun they are having. But I really like the alliteration and colors@gabbgoudy @BraydenBallin @cavs Cavs have had the biggest turn around of any team in the league this year.
