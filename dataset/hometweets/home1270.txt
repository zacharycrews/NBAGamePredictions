You do not live in MiamiIt wouldn't be a shock if the @MiamiHEAT decides to let Markieff Morris play his first playoff game this season and also start Oladipo for Jimmy Butler.

#HEATCulture #MIAvsATL #NBAPlayoffsPut me us out of our misery please @MiamiHEAT@1JohnJack_ @MiamiHEAT @ATLHawks I know!!!!
I guess I won't have to ask where Bogi is tonight!@eazybreezy561 @MiamiHEAT That is true. Going up against 76ers@MiamiHEAT fans and heat fans only we get to see playoffs dipo start 🥰🥰🥰@MiamiHEAT This is fine guys we have like 15 other dogs in that pack. We got this.@MiamiHEAT He has the worst luck! He’s always injured 😭@josemastrapa2 @MiamiHEAT Lol nahhh get healthy for next roundI've heard Jimmy Butler is not playing tonight. Looking for a big game from Tyler Herro (@raf_tyler). He is absolutely capable of running the @MiamiHEAT offense...@MiamiHEAT Dipo day ‼‼ https://t.co/msgxODcay8@eazybreezy561 @MiamiHEAT Play hurt lol@putemupcdukes @MiamiHEAT @ATLHawks We got hope!@MiamiHEAT 👀👀👀 Dipo starting tonight???? 🤔@josemastrapa2 @MiamiHEAT Both hurt man.@putemupcdukes @MiamiHEAT @ATLHawks No Bogi tonightMiami Heat stars Jimmy Butler and Kyle Lowry are both OUT tonight for Game 5 vs. the Atlanta Hawks

#TrueToAtlantaHeat/Hawks:

Young O26.5
Herro O21.5

The mindset of not having to face Butler &amp; Lowry is big for Trae. This gives the team a bit of hope &amp; belief that they can win the game. Can they? Yes they can. Somebody has to score for Miami, Herro hasn’t shot well at all, needs to tonight https://t.co/DxfYxHAmm4@eazybreezy561 @MiamiHEAT Wait what !!!!!No Jimmy Butler tonight for the @MiamiHEAT. Looks like Trey Young may get a night off from being hounded. @NBAPlayoffs2022 injuries to superstars just keep mounting.@MiamiHEAT START VIC. START VIC. He’s been a star in this league. He’s ready to go@MiamiHEAT let’s close out the series at home https://t.co/nXaOyBrpbK🔹Prediction🔹

▫️PJ Tucker will lead the Miami Heat in scoring tonight vs the Hawks

#HEATCulture https://t.co/oEJawtRWw1I don’t see #MiamiHeat winning this without Butler even IN Miami@MiamiHEAT Oladipo, Gabe, Duncan, Caleb, Max, Tyler, Bam, PJ. Everybody has to step up and no I'm not expecting Vic to be dominant and most fans shouldn't we just need a great team game@BallyHEAT Victor Oladipo can overtake LeBron James as the all-time playoff leader in points if he will score 7,342 tonight against the Hawks, sources tell me and @MiamiHEAT.@MightBeDayo i was trolling but I think you’re deadass lmao. So let me be serious then 

you really believe playing without fans, in a nice five star amusement park is a the hardest chip ever ? Y’all beat miami heat without their leading scorer in the playoffs.I like this one too, either u want to go with Jays  -1, or this ML parlay with Heat, both are good 4 me.

Even with Jimmy out for today's game in Miami I don't see Hawks being a threat for the ML.

I think the Heat HONESTLY feel they can beat the Hawks without them, so get the rest started now.

I was on the Hawks +7 today. Miami was getting all the bets and money, yet the line wasn't moving.

Continue to win, decent market, one of the more popular franchises in the league, but we're still talking about the Nets who were a failed test.@celticsideline @AIR305 @MiamiHEAT @jj_redick No one is saying the Celtics aren't great. The Brooklyn Nets looked bad with KD back at the end of the season. The flaws that people talked about since last year (lack of defense &amp; no coaching) have come to fruition.

I can also confidently say they are much better than the hawks and it’s not close. The C’s had the hardest first round matchup and swept them.

This series is over. The Heat just have too many able-bodied defenders for Young  &amp; Atlanta to deal with. Feels like a bit of a dead rubber so we're getting creative with the tip.

And Richard Jefferson said they won't beat the heat. Because beating the nets playing 1on1 b ball makes them easy to guard. Miami passes the ball that's harder to guard.

The proof is turning on any game he played this yearMichael Jordan vs Miami Heat LeBron James!

I don’t want him. He gets beat on ball and would be picked onMan if the Knicks can summon Mike Bibby to win Game 4 vs the Miami Heat, Kevin Durant and Kyrie better make it happen tonight. 

This is extremely pathetic.@REALZ2NY @SeanDeveney @Lakers @BrooklynNets @nyknicks @MiamiHEAT @celtics @HeavySan It’s 2022 lmao@rayfordyoung All this rah rah one minute then the Heat flopping the next...🤡☠️ Trae lives rent free in all their heads daily...

Finals they're 🧂@MiamiHEAT No animosity on the contrary Vic can only help The Heat and Jimmy to win a Championship@HeatvsHaters @MiamiHEAT We got Vic . We good@kugirl25 I think it's too safe, but nothing will ever beat the Miami Heat's "Miami Vice" city connection unis.
