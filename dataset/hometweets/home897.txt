Jimmy better get a head start on his Mormon mission cuz he’s gonna be a Utah Jazz player this summerNBA Player Prop:
Royce O'Neale Over .5 Turnovers -150 (Utah Jazz)

This is the top rated prop from my model I was hoping the juice would drop but I get why it is juiced... 8/L10, 6 games in a row with 1+ TO for Royce. Tough matchup tonight.
I have O'Neale proj. For 2.3 TOLooks like Vivint is going to turn the arena into a concert at the end of the third quarter by having fans phones synced to the music they plan to play

His Dallas Mavericks play the Utah Jazz on Friday.@MixerNitro @RMS_78 @jalenflys @TupacAG The only team he played outside of the washed lakers in the finals. With more than 1 HOF’r was the Utah Jazz.  Every other team was playing against a super squad.  Give Barkley Pippen and Jordan Dan Majerle. The suns beat them easily.@MixerNitro @RMS_78 @jalenflys @TupacAG Horrible competition.  Magic Larry were washed the pistons run was done. Shaq was too young (but beat him). His toughest competition was the Utah Jazz.  Ducked the Rockets. 6 Expansion teams= diluted talent. Hardly any international talent.@Amar23189 @Chriftopher apparently you're allowed to lose by 26 points and only score 85 against a Utah Jazz team with no Rudy Gobert...@dustinlocke @utahjazz @rudygobert27 @spidadmitchell @Joeingles7 @BucketsONeale00 You nailed it.

I mean miami's 'ransom note' jerseys are a bit much... but
Utah has ledges too.. go out on one (risk a bit)E.J. Liddell (@EasyE2432) would be a tremendous fit for what the @utahjazz do. I hope Utah finds itself in position to draft Liddell.@TheCatOnBallyTV Not opposed to a franchise moving here but this is a case where a name change is definitely needed. Still think the “Utah Jazz” is ridiculous.The Grizzlies &amp; Bucks pack has arrived🤩

#TakeNote | @UofUHealth https://t.co/uyxDHlyIBZ@TheHoopCentral Got to see it to believe it from the Bulls in the Playoffs. Same with Utah Jazz.It should be illegal for a basketball team to be named "Utah Jazz.".@ATLHawks run that pick-and-roll game like @utahjazz did back in the day with John Stockton (wear a damn mask) and Karl Malone (wonder if he still likes teenage girls?). #TrueToAtlanta #TakeNote #NBA #NBATwitter
