He's great but to act like he's the reason they got that much better is a stretch. Mobley has a complete team around him. Cades responsibilities are far greater, and he's a leader, as a rookie, that's more impressive.I’m really hoping the Tigers can end the current Detroit sports curse. Lion’s gave me a glimmer, Pistons have had  a little life and Cade is amazing, Wings have kinda been “just the tip” this winter, but the pants seem to be zipped up on the season now….I want the @DetroitPistons to draft Keegan Murray from Iowa

That shot is too pure

I’ve watched every game of each of the top rookies this year.. Can’t just evaluate on eye test alone, need tangible evidence@ProPistons @DetroitPistons I’m really hoping to be a season tickets holder in the next 5 years.

#Pistons @DetroitPistons 

Great afternoon and thanks for lunch ;-)You know your playing @NBA2K when the @DetroitPistons arena is full#Detroit #Pistons @DetroitPistons meet the team event!!!!!! https://t.co/5aydYAaqNY@TheGodDame1 @TheEyeTest31 @ripsnupeysl @overtime @DetroitPistons @CadeCunningham_ 😂 ur all worked up bruh. Chillax lol@TheEyeTest31 @TheGodDame1 @ripsnupeysl @overtime @DetroitPistons @CadeCunningham_ Advanced stats always point to Jordan, LeBron, Kareem being the best… Seems like u don’t understand how to interpret the 1s which seem to favor more games played, longer career 😂@BGB2187 @overtime @DetroitPistons @CadeCunningham_ Check the records sir@TheGodDame1 @TheEyeTest31 @ripsnupeysl @overtime @DetroitPistons @CadeCunningham_ So ur saying u use emotion and feelings, no quantitative evidence, little objectivity when evaluating a player. Got it 😂@Mischakatja @rjerome217 @umdet3 @overtime @DetroitPistons @CadeCunningham_ Yeah I don't agree with things like that at all but I do think he will end up being the best in the class when it's all said and done but admittedly that could be because I see him every game unlike the other guys.@Mischakatja @rjerome217 @umdet3 @overtime @DetroitPistons @CadeCunningham_ His TOs are def a concern for me, while some can be blamed by the talent around him I can't give him a free pass there though.He does have a loose dribble at time and can try too tough of passes but if the assists go up to offset that they won't look as bad.@_mattyc_ @rjerome217 @umdet3 @overtime @DetroitPistons @CadeCunningham_ I guess I’m just trying to give balance to all the homer, slappy fans and beat writers. Adam from Woodward Sports said Cade was ROTY and that it’s not even close@TheGodDame1 @Mischakatja @ripsnupeysl @overtime @DetroitPistons @CadeCunningham_ Analytics guys, he probably think Stockton is the goat based off analytics lol@LeGOATBurner23 @overtime @DetroitPistons @CadeCunningham_ Cavs lost last night….Our craft beer partner, @embctweets is throwing THE 313 party in Detroit 🎉

Join them tomorrow starting at 11AM for the launch of their 313 IPA. All day the beer will be $𝟯.𝟭𝟯 to honor the big day. Stop by early for a chance to win tickets to tomorrow's game. #Pistons313Day https://t.co/zrArDYReBx@_mattyc_ @rjerome217 @umdet3 @overtime @DetroitPistons @CadeCunningham_ .320 winning % with Cade. Ya it’s an improvement but it’s still bad…… Cade has a high TO rate. Wouldn’t be bad if he had better efficiency scoring… Cade had  a bad assist-TO in college too. We’ll see if that changes over career when Pistons hopefully get better talent@TyR503 @overtime @DetroitPistons @CadeCunningham_ He was 10-21 before a rough 4th.. keep box score watching though.@Mischakatja @rjerome217 @umdet3 @overtime @DetroitPistons @CadeCunningham_ And again I never said he was the best rookie but I was trying to defend the fact that he hasnt been bad like you and others have said cause of his advanced metrics.@Mischakatja @rjerome217 @umdet3 @overtime @DetroitPistons @CadeCunningham_ My case is their record with him vs. without him. If he has a negative impact shouldn't that mean the team plays worse with him? Also with all his teammates shooting under 40% he doesnt get the assists he otherwise would so his Assist to TO ratio suffers.@Ossein_Garland @RipHamilton32 he's honestly one of my favorite players, if not my favorite. never seen a guy shoot like that in my life.

Not even from Detroit but he's p much the reason I'm a Pistons fan. Their bout against the Lakers in the finals back in the 2000s was a legendary underdog story.
