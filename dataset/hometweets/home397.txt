@nyknicks take on the world champion @Bucks @TheGarden, hoping to get back on track while shorthanded. @MSGNetworks #letsgoknicks #knicksnation@nyknicks Are there some Kemba bench minutes to be had?@nyknicks THIBS STARTING A Rookie. This gotta be some fake news@nyknicks I love Rose starting as long as it means he is the primary ball handler and is allowed to run the offense. If it's Randle dribbling the ball into a double team for 23 secs its a blow-out. Julius has to play within the offense and be fed near the paint instead of playing iso ballNBA Sunday ....

With Evan and Grimes being in the lineup.@nyknicks Scrumptious@nyknicks How In hell the medical experts, media News broadcasters, Government agencies  etc. is telling ppl to go get vaccinated when every time u look there’s someone getting the virus &amp; they are vaccinated.

We need to put pressure on Thibs. Please@FleelixTrinidad @nyknicks Your only looking at one tweet. I no Randle isn't trash but he's not playing to his strengths. I am sure you played ball..Randle is 6"9. He can punish a team in the paint, but he's shooting 3's. How about come off the screen or cut, no he's dribble,  dribble, dribble TO.@nyknicks Thought Noel was out@nyknicks GRIMES STARTING?! https://t.co/LJ9hhuwuHY@chill4will @nyknicks That’s what I don’t understand. Is hometown star Kemba now completely unplayable and in Thibs doghouse?

Leads you to believe there’s more to the story than what they’re letting us know.@hhpthebook @nyknicks To say Julius Randle is trash is just ridiculous. He put in the work to improve and is pretty much averaging the same numbers.

They should bring up Samanic from G League to see if he gives us energy and help, he's playing terrific down there. They need to turn the season around soon.@hhpthebook @lifesabrees @nyknicks Ball dominance 
+ inefficiency 
+ turnovers 
+ lack of movement 
+ general lack of energy/intensity a lot of times …
= a whole team that seems to play worse.

Which is why Obi usually at least sparks the team b/c he at least brings movement, energy, rhythm, etc.At this rate, Thibs is gonna have to play Kemba. #Knicks @nyknicks #NYK #NewYorkForever https://t.co/QeJTvSEqqp@doll_aim @TheGarden @nyknicks @NYRangers @RjBarrett6 Hope you enjoy your day.

New York will now be without Burks, Barrett, and Toppin for todays game vs Milwaukee.@NY_KnicksPR @nyknicks No Burks, Obi or RJ, We are losing by 50 at leastSo can Kemba start or is Thibs going to be stubborn? @nyknicks https://t.co/yKPqkGv9N8@doll_aim @TheGarden @nyknicks @NYRangers @RjBarrett6 Now that’s a doubleheader!

Either you have it or you don’t.  His age is slipping out of the relevant scorecard with every passing day.  It’s got to be in his head from night to night.

At the same time, they're the second worst team in the NBA in allowing wide open 3s.
They also have the worst opp eFG% in wide open shots overall.

For a team that prides itself on defense, that's embarrassing..@madicmonday @nyknicks I've been saying that since last year. I'm still amazed that no one in this entire organization can see this!@HolesMad @nyknicks He just might know him 🤦🤦🤦@hhpthebook @nyknicks Thibs treats Randle like he’s LBJ—like come on:
1) He doesn’t need to bring the ball up court—let the guards do that! Randle = no handle + inaccurate passer =a walking turnover!
2) we don’t need to ALWAYS force feed the offense thru him! Wtf?!
3) he doesn’t NEED 39 mpg. Free Obi!@hhpthebook @johnhersperger @nyknicks He needs a PG a pure one to play with him, to take to the ball out of his hands and give him the ball in the proper spots.

I was just venting. But you are absolutely correct.@lifesabrees @hhpthebook @nyknicks Randle’s our $30M /yr “all star” tho.
RJ’s still only 21; + RJ’s def improved since Duke! Compare last yr to his rookie yr—much better player overall, took a step up. We hoped he’d take 1 more step this yr…he’s shown stretches of that but he needs to deliver more consistently💯.@johnhersperger @nyknicks He definitely doesn't stink in terms of skill, dude can play I agree. However when I say stink, he doesn't know that he's not the guy he thinks he is. He should be punishing his defender down low, not shooting 3's. Focus on being the leading rebounder.  Do other things out there.the new york knicks hoodie.... https://t.co/x7dwfgdEcu@Btruetolife I agreee with thibs making it harder on himself… but drose and kemba sadly arent the answers. Quickley, deuce and grimes are your solutions. They have the energy, the perimeter scoring AND the defense. @nyknicks gotta get thibs to play them.

There was no way he was going to repeat. His #’s are basically the same, even turnovers, except for FG% 10 ft and out which is down.@doll_aim @TheGarden @nyknicks @NYRangers @RjBarrett6 Represent @doll_aim !!!!!@SamoriBenjamin @nyknicks And I bet you think my tweets are about you. I'm not here looking for a debate. Try that low budget reverse psychology somewhere else.@lifesabrees @nyknicks I respect that, but if you watch carefully...Randle sucks the life out of the first unit. RJ has to dribble from the 3 point line to the basket to try and get a shot off...because the ball doesn't move.Woke Up Thinking Not Another Matinee Game For My @nyknicks. Gm Tho Every1@nyknicks zion alway wanted to be a knick@yawgeezmusic @nyknicks Facts. The starters were down by 20. The Bench with Obi brought us all the way and Thibs pulls Obi and inserts Randle. Same guy that was in there when the team went down by 20. Smh@hhpthebook @nyknicks And I bet you think Carmelo Anthony is a Hall of Famer 😆😁😄😀😃🤣😂🤣😂@hhpthebook @nyknicks Agreed💯.
Kemba is not only benched but playing ZERO min! Why’s that Thibs? Kemba had one too many lapses on defense? Ok. But why single out Kemba &amp; continue playing Randle 38 mpg? Randle has more than his fair share of shitty plays.

#NewYorkForever #Knicks #KnicksTape@hhpthebook @nyknicks Best Tweet I’ve seen this month@hhpthebook @nyknicks Yea.  I am never going to understand absolving Randle for his shortcomings.   Makes no sense.If my @nyknicks come out 1-1 in the next two games against the @Bucks and the @warriors and then go on an 8-0 streak against the remaining games in December, we will enter the New Year with a 21-15 record.

I truly believe the 8 games are winnable games.

#NewYorkForever@hhpthebook @nyknicks I agree 
Most of Knicks problem seen when Randel is playing 
This is not a common opinion but for me its factIt would be fun to watch @StephenCurry30 break the record at MSG, and they lose to the @nyknicks. I'm sure the crowd will celebrate his personal milestone and the team's win.

That will be a great day for me.

📽️ https://t.co/EvmjriG3XP via @YouTubeIn 2013, Curry showed Knicks fans they were right to be frustrated when he didn't fall to New York on draft night.Steph posted a career-high 54 points.He knocked down 11-13 3-point attempts, falling just one three shy of tying what was then the NBA record. #NBATopShotThis  🙌 https://t.co/aKbxPxNeY0@katrinalofaro @FahimInsurance @nyknicks @TheGarden Hope so!@NY_KnicksPR @nyknicks Honesty I believe the knicks should go small ball with randle at the 5 and obi at the 4@_FrankWest @FahimInsurance @nyknicks @TheGarden Home opener was freaking awesome!@badseedsteve @FahimInsurance @nyknicks @TheGarden Ah man, AAU!

Barrett is a typical Duke player. Why Thibs bench Kemba and gives Obi limited minutes off the bench he hating on New York players except Gibson but he old. Play the young boys.

https://t.co/cwhRAYJakVi don’t even know what we need because I feel our problem is psychological and the players don’t seem to want to change their psychology or be consistent about it so it is what it is with the @nyknicks this season. garbage starting 5 play and top bench in the nba. what a jerkoff.@nbanowandthen The father of the New York Knickseverybody keeps saying the @nyknicks were 11-13 when we got Rose last year so we’ll probably go get somebody now since we got a similar record now. do you understand how shitty that is? we finished 4th, first round playoffs, resigned our all star, “upgraded offense” for 12-14?!? https://t.co/PMQHgmDR01Start IQ @nyknicks@nyknicks it’s time to make the move he don’t want to@be in New Orleans https://t.co/pENpm9DZS4@MrAlbee_ @Raptors @nyknicks @nbatopshot Happy bday! 🏀@nyknicks @boxand21 @thibodeau_coach
