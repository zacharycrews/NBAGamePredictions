This gotta be some fake news@nyknicks I love Rose starting as long as it means he is the primary ball handler and is allowed to run the offense. If it's Randle dribbling the ball into a double team for 23 secs its a blow-out. Julius has to play within the offense and be fed near the paint instead of playing iso ballNBA Sunday ....

+ inefficiency

They also have the worst opp eFG% in wide open shots overall.

#NewYorkForever #Knicks #KnicksTape@hhpthebook @nyknicks Best Tweet I‚Äôve seen this month@hhpthebook @nyknicks Yea.  I am never going to understand absolving Randle for his shortcomings.   Makes no sense.If my @nyknicks come out 1-1 in the next two games against the @Bucks and the @warriors and then go on an 8-0 streak against the remaining games in December, we will enter the New Year with a 21-15 record.

I truly believe the 8 games are winnable games.

#NewYorkForever@hhpthebook @nyknicks I agree 
Most of Knicks problem seen when Randel is playing 
This is not a common opinion but for me its factIt would be fun to watch @StephenCurry30 break the record at MSG, and they lose to the @nyknicks. I'm sure the crowd will celebrate his personal milestone and the team's win.

That will be a great day for me.

When are we going to wake up and realize that and start taking his minutes.

They wanna pretend cities like Kansas City and Boston are relevant enough to win stuff. When they grow up and stop this nonsense the jets and Knicks will dominate their leagues. https://t.co/gMpzzwzN5D#GaryTrentJr. scores 24, #Raptors beat struggling #Knicks 90-87  https://t.co/NSsfr1sXA8
#nba #newyorkknicks@SeanXLove2021 @jdbatts79 @KDurantSZN @TheNBACentral @TheSteinLine In New York City, San Francisco and Los Angeles, out-of-town teams are exempt from the vaccination mandates, meaning unvaccinated players on opposing teams will be allowed to play at Madison Square Garden (Knicks), Barclays Center (Nets),(Warriors) and Lakers, Clippers).Bucks continue road trip against slumping Knicks https://t.co/Nm8eGe5yth #NBA #MilwaukeeBucks #NewYorkKnicksThe New York Knicks are 7-13 (.350) since 1 November. That would be the sixth worse record in the NBA today in terms of win-loss percentage.

1-5 since taking Kemba Walker out of the rotation.

The next two games are against Milwaukee and Golden State at home. 

Tough times..@fuegofredo23 @nyknicks @obitoppin1 Need a Wally Pipp moment and the rest is history!Former #FSU Guard @ScottBarnes561 With A Huge Slam Dunk Against The New York Knicks.üò≥üî•üç¢

#GoNoles #OneTribe #ProNoles @FSUCoachHam https://t.co/6WVslkkfuw@nyknicks @obitoppin1 Thibs need to start Toppin at the 3 &amp; RJ at the 2. He won‚Äôt be missing anything on the defensive end &amp; I really think with Randle getting his nonchalant diva ass right they‚Äôll be ok offensively‚Ä¶@nyknicks @obitoppin1 Give him more minutes!  Run plans for him. He plays above the rim. #freeObi@nyknicks @obitoppin1 Start him and Julius together. Mitch off the bench. Bench Noel@MrHart__ @nyknicks @obitoppin1 It ain‚Äôt 2k, you can‚Äôt put that lineup out there. Obi can‚Äôt move laterally with quickness. He won‚Äôt be able to keep up with SFs. Perhaps in certain situations maybe they can go big but it‚Äôll just clog the lane for Obi and he won‚Äôt be as effective cutting.@sny_knicks Definitely not worth turning the New York Knicks into the Portland trail blazers for Damian Lillard.@nyknicks @obitoppin1 Start Obi at the 3 and move RJ to the 2 and have Evan come off the bench!Tom Thibodeau is the problem on the @nyknicks, not the players.@PlayoffBoundNYK @nyknicks @obitoppin1 nah it was bc he got hit in the face@nyknicks @obitoppin1 I‚Äôve seen enough, build around Obi NOW!
