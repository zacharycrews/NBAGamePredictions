@dallasmavs | #MFFL https://t.co/Ef2G6axpVEThe biggest question I have for Wolves/Mavericks is how Dallas guards Ant tonight.

KAT had 26, 14 and 7 against the Mavs when he was largely guarded by Dwight Powell in Game 2 in December.

If DFS gets KAT, Luka or Dinwiddie will likely guard Ant -- a huge mismatch.Tonight's starting lineup for the Dallas Mavericks: Doncic, Brunson, Bullock, Finney-Smith, Powell https://t.co/bVWH4AMCA2@dallasmavs @ModeloUSA Reggie is back 🔐Dallas Mavericks Starters:

Luka Doncic
Jalen Brunson
Reggie Bullock
Dorian Finney-Smith
Dwight Powell

BAD@James30545 @Since19854 @JRus25 @hypetrain87 @statmuse @dallasmavs When we traded for Harden we gave this yr up with hopes of off loading Tobi n Picks for another star. I'd try to get 2/3 role players rather 1 guy. Maxey is like only player to workout draft in like 5 yrs. Trade multiple Reed/Bassey/Springer/Furk/Shake for 1/2 GOOD role guys@James30545 @Since19854 @JRus25 @hypetrain87 @statmuse @dallasmavs Depth makes all the difference, if we had depth Jo n Harden could have nights off not be ran to break.

Danny Green is the definition of a streaky shooter (a good defender though), Niang is similar but not as streaky, Idek what to say about Shake, Korkmaz doesn’t do much, and DJ frequently makes careless errors and misses layups and lobs sometimes.dallas mavericks https://t.co/qw1iIAfCo3@James30545 @TheRealSikko @JRus25 @hypetrain87 @statmuse @dallasmavs I agree it’s not as big of a deal in the playoffs when you cut the rotation down to 7/8 players but the problem is we don’t even have 7 players which means during the regular season there’s no relief for the starters. We can’t get 20 points from the bench?@Since19854 @TheRealSikko @JRus25 @hypetrain87 @statmuse @dallasmavs I’m of the belief that depth is overrated in the playoffs specifically. It’s part of the reason why teams like the Jazz don’t go very far. Depth does definitely help a great deal, but it’s not as big of a deal as some people make it out to be imo.NBA:🏀

#RaisedByWolves@DownScreenMan @cajuneagle1955 @mcuban @dallasmavs Yes and Cuban has made plenty of organizational mistakes; all Mavs fans know that.The fact that Donnie even brought them up in the suit tells me that some of this is sour grapes.I don't want to just dismiss sexual assault though.If that part is true,there needs to be consequences@MavsTracker @BallySportsSW @AACenter @dallasmavs @Timberwolves Kat tonight https://t.co/lbaqTcxXS2@BobbyCryrella @reddevil0004 @dallasmavs Always a silver lining to knowing the hawks had net positive injury benefits this year (bulls injuries, Cavs injuries, nets injuries, hornets injuries) and still plummeted down the standingsThe Mavericks are entering the most crucial stretch of the season:

But tossing his nephew in? I’m guessing something happened.@cajuneagle1955 @mcuban @dallasmavs I also don’t believe Mark’s $100 million extortion claim though. The Mavs had just not gone anywhere in 10 years, it was time to change Donnie and Carlisle both.@cajuneagle1955 @mcuban @dallasmavs I don’t think so. Why didn’t Nelson just go to authorities? Also, the fact that he brought up Cuban’s failures (not drafting Giannis, free agency strike outs, letting Steve Nash walk), it’s a lot of sour grapes IMO.Check out  the viewing party this Wednesday at the @BigCityWings Marq*e location for the Rockets vs. the Dallas Mavericks!
