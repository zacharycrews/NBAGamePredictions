The Milwaukee Bucks and Orlando Magic will be playing for a 2nd time in 3 days Thursday.

They won't come close toAlright my only prop today is Khris middleton vs the Orlando magic. Yes we are running it back!

@MountainDew x #MagicTogether https://t.co/vuH3zhL0TR@MalikG @AlMagicHQ @OrlandoMagic @theterrylee @ilikethisteam11 Definitely a valid option as well.While Franz Wagner hasn't gotten the national attention like other rookies this season, he has been great lately. As we head into 2022, @KoleEmplit takes a look at how the rookie has found success with the Orlando Magic. #NBA #NBATwitter #MagicTogether https://t.co/siFTIM42lw@NBAHistory @OrlandoMagic Who?

What would y'all think of that?

https://t.co/PhTwsC6Xl0@OrlandoMagic @Bucks @AmwayCenter @BallySportsFL @969thegame @franzboogie Wonder what Bucks will do to game plan for Franz today. They were double teaming and trapping him with their best defenders last time out. But if he is able to even slightly replicate what he did last game...the dude will double down on his ROTY case.The @OrlandoMagic (7-28) have six games left in the first half of the season.

#NBAPicks #FearTheDeer #MagicTogether https://t.co/5tjTDeonWJ@NBATV @franzboogie @Kia @OrlandoMagic He’s the only one whos not in protocol.. dumb ass captionThe most frustrating thing about the @OrlandoMagic is their inability to give injury updates. We know next to nothing about Markelle, Suggs, JI, or when Mo is expected back.Despite it all, we choose to look at the positives: Drafting Suggs and Wagner, a much improved Cole Anthony and key players returning back from injuries in early 2022. 

Hang in there, Magic fans! Things will get better soon!
