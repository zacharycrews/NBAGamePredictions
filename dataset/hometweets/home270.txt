No chance Silas should be fired now or in the immediate future.Report: Houston Rockets considering firing Stephen Silas https://t.co/ywelBh8HvP@JabariDavisNBA Houston isn’t a good team, but are they really 1-win bad? I obviously don’t think Silas should be fired, but the Rockets are currently on pace to be the worst team in NBA history by quite some margin.Houston Rockets game tonight hmmm@Derekiknow That wasn’t in 2017 that was in the bubble when he was a Houston Rocket he was clutch af in game 7 when Harden was playing horrible@reillygarrett2 He’s 18-71 as a head coach of the Houston rockets .
He coached them the entirety of last year .Y’all got to listen to the real fans @HoustonRockets . Keep the black coach and the black GM. https://t.co/NnSqbafw2cI hate when non Rockets fans get in Rockets business.

No way that Silas should be fired. What roster stability has he had since he arrived? 🤔🤔🤔🤔

Houston (and the Greater Houston Area) LOVE Houston sports teams. Especially Houston sports teams they can watch on tv.
