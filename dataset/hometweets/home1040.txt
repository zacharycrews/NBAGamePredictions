But we need him to be the big man against the Suns and the Bucks.  Sorry, but I didn't see that level of play tonight.  Hope I'm proved wrong.@EarlyRiser54321 @Ares___00 @957thegame @GLeagueWarriors @warriors They are still nba players even though they are in the G league. You act like they were going easy on him@Ares___00 @957thegame @GLeagueWarriors @warriors Just saw on 95.7 that they will "reevaluate him later this week".   Let's be honest here: All the top guys saw him in Chase the other night.  If they thought he was ready they wouldn't have sent him down south today.   And he wasn't any better tonight than he was Sunday.Vangie won 2 out of 3 air hockey games 😤

That was fun, thanks @warriors https://t.co/q87795UIenCongratulations to BooshTK (@gerab2004) who moved up 51 spots to take #42 on the Golden State Warriors team leaderboard.

Do they snarl they said 🤣🤣🤣 #fail https://t.co/hT8Rb8wFb33) The other two picks are killing it for their teams. Lamelo could have done what Poole is doing right away so why did Warriors pass on him is strange question. All these things are true and Longer this uncertainty around JW goes, The questions will keep increasing @warriors@NBA @StephenCurry30 @warriors The dude’s magic. 🎂They’re also the same fans that shit on the @warriors front office ALL OFF-SEASON for not making a move for Beal, for “wasting Steph’s prime”, etc. these fans are annoying af and have become spoiled since 2015. #godubsHonestly, the same dumbass @warriors fans that shit constantly on Poole early in his career are the same fans that are shitting on Wiseman every damn day. It’s honestly annoying af. just stfu and let the dude do his thing. #dubnation #dubs38° Jogo - Golden State Warriors 104 x 113 Milwaukee Bucks

We've seen what he can do on both ends when he is being fed by his teammates. And to see that he averaged a double-double in his first two games, that's a sign that he's ready imo.Perk weighs in on Embiid's MVP odds, Draymond Green's value to Warriors | SportsCenter #GoldenState #Warriors #NBA Video: https://t.co/gELQPSHUddThis event that @Rakuten does w/ @warriors has always been dear to my heart.
