you already have a stud who can play make . he'll fit great next 2 cade who already has 5.4 ast  p game . the pistons need someone who can put the ball in the hole . 
he makes you better ( a lot ) trust me . but that's my take@drew77982753 @Lakers @DetroitPistons @SacramentoKings @NBA Having flexibility to me isn‚Äôt just to get top talent. It‚Äôs to get role players and make sure that we don‚Äôt commit before knowing what we really have with the youth.

He‚Äôs good, but he‚Äôs not making us that much better. He‚Äôs not that great of a playmaker or a threat on his outside shooting.

i think if bagley performs well he's gone . bey isn't better than fox 
fox is a top talent that will fit amazing with the young core  and you have him tied down@ZayTurner24 @Jackd_194 @DetroitPistons @JeramiGrant @SaddiqBey @CadeCunningham_ Add on top that the Blazers have two top picks this year.

He‚Äôs better being on a contender and us getting assets for him. He wasn‚Äôt ever the long term piece, so it‚Äôs good to move him.@RicSexton_ def just flexed lmao

With the overall No. 1 pick in the National Basketball Association draft, the @DetroitPistons select Bob Lanier of St. Bonaventure after winning a coin toss.
