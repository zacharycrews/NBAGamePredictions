SWEET!!!
LIGHT THEM UP!!!!!@Hoeffel85 @Brycen77 @BeenKnightedUCF @A_Watt91 @OrlandoMagic Cmon man. Its clear you dont like AG. This isnt even a debate. Does it suck that he is one of our best players in the last decade? Of course. But it is what it is. Dwight was barely in this decade. Jameer, hedo were shells of their former selfs and lewis wasnt here in the decade@Brycen77 @OCPDesigns @BeenKnightedUCF @A_Watt91 @OrlandoMagic I'd put Gordon somewhere around elfrid Payton.The Orlando Magic host the ‚Äò21 NBA MVP Nikola Jokic and the Denver Nuggets.

I‚Äôm covering the game tonight over at @OPPMagicBlog https://t.co/ekV9ox1UXH@OCPDesigns @BeenKnightedUCF @Brycen77 @A_Watt91 @OrlandoMagic I forgot JI played basketball. But your right...he's another one.@Brycen77 @Hoeffel85 @OCPDesigns @A_Watt91 @OrlandoMagic Yes, it isn‚Äôt even close either lmfao. Gordon was a liability. Those two actually contribute *something*@OCPDesigns @BeenKnightedUCF @Brycen77 @A_Watt91 @OrlandoMagic How does Howard Nelson Lewis hedo get knocked off?@Brycen77 @OCPDesigns @BeenKnightedUCF @A_Watt91 @OrlandoMagic Franz rookie season is better than any season Gordon has played. This isn't even debatable@Hoeffel85 @BeenKnightedUCF @Brycen77 @A_Watt91 @OrlandoMagic There's really no debate. He's been one of our best players in the last decade whether you like or dislike him personally. Vuc, Fournier, JI, tobias harris and maybe terrence ross are the only ones in this discussion.@Brycen77 @OCPDesigns @BeenKnightedUCF @A_Watt91 @OrlandoMagic Yes they both better than Gordon already.... easily bro.@OrlandoMagic @Double0AG Why orlando Salty.  You want players to live and die as magics just cuz you as fans have to?  Tsk tsk tsk.@Hoeffel85 @Brycen77 @OCPDesigns @A_Watt91 @OrlandoMagic Once Fultz and Isaac are fully healthy they‚Äôll make this list too. Id leave Franz off only because he has played just 20 games. However he has been so much better than anything I‚Äôve ever seen from AG.@Brycen77 @OCPDesigns @BeenKnightedUCF @A_Watt91 @OrlandoMagic Howard, Hedo, Lewis, Nelson, Vuc, Fournier, Franz, Cole, Reddick, Tobias Harris, oladipo, Ross. 

That's just off the top of my head. You could argue many others.@Justin2k_ @Orlandrew5 @OrlandoMagic And you can‚Äôt forget we got a frp out of it. RJ has insane potential though. Like I said he is still 20 years old and has shown some extreme flashes at times. When he puts it all together it‚Äôs going to be something special.@fayzeeeg Makes sense. I‚Äôm crying about Seager but have worn my Orlando Magic Shaq jersey before. I‚Äôm just pissed he left. You root for these guys for years then they bounce. Joc was a Dodger for 10 years. That‚Äôs 1/4 of my life.@Hoeffel85 @OCPDesigns @BeenKnightedUCF @A_Watt91 @OrlandoMagic Im interested in hearing them@Justin2k_ @Orlandrew5 @OrlandoMagic Ain‚Äôt nobody care about Gary Harris, and RJ is way more impactful this year, his efficiency is down but it‚Äôs just an issue of slowing himself down. Some days he shows he is capable of that, just gotta show consistency. He‚Äôs 20 lolTODAY ON ALTITUDE SPORTS RADIO:

That's why I said the fact that he was one of our best players on the last decade is sad, but true. It's more a statement about our franchise than it is a statement about AG.@drnugget @OrlandoMagic @Double0AG I can allow it.
