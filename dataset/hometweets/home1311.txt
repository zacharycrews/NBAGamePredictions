Play physical. Tatum et al play and not bitch about calls get back on defense. Don’t force ball to Tatum if he is double and triple teamed, drive and kick ball to open shooter like PP or Grant. Rebound. Take care of the ball.Don’t be an embarrassment today @celticsPlease @celtics@celtics Jaylen, I’m rooting for you I swear I am but ima need you to pass on the dribble and drive drive DRIVE to the basket! #Respectfully@celtics Gotta have it tonight C's , go get it !!!!2022 NBA Live Streaming HD  Game 4

Muito forte. 👑@NBA @celtics What the nba really needs is to move to a 100 yard field, 11 players each team, make running with the ball legal, allow forward passes, make tackling legal, and give six points for each score.  Also if you don’t go 10 yards in 4 try’s it’s the other teams turn. Just ideas.Tonight, BCS stands for Boston CelticS@celtics Tatum is available. Does that mean he will play defense?

The Celtics have lost three Scott-Foster-led games this season, including Game 1 vs. MIL when they lost by 12.

But it is true that the home team has won 77% of its games with Kane Fitzgerald officiating this season, tops for any official.Makes sense to keep him out of game 4 then. @celtics have fun turning the ball over later.

It’s unfortunate how injuries continue to rob the #NBA and #NBAPlayoffs yet we continue to complain about load management. 🤔@LanceBolton_ @celtics True… But I don’t think Pritchard is the liability defensively as advertised. He is not a stopper by any stretch. It’s his size that hurts, not ability. I don’t think the gap between PP and White is that wide. Also, attacking PP gets Miami out of their offensive flow.@celtics #Celtics by 10+

QuicklyDear @celtics

 https://t.co/adHcEaSBaJ@celtics With Marcus Smart out, I am ok with starting Derrick White… but Payton Pritchard needs more minutes than White. 

However, if it were me… I would start Pritchard. Pritchard on the floor w/ Jaylen &amp; Tatum opens driving lanes for the J’s. Miami can hedge more w/ White.@brandon_lirio22 @celtics nothing, and I mean nothing, can be worse than Theis in the starting lineup@ballerzlifer @tennkings @Patty_Nasty @celtics I haven’t seen any heat players or coaches mention it. And the only analysts that commented on the play said it was not dirty. Don’t forget jimmy had inflammation against the hawks too@celtics This is why Tatum choking in game 3 matters so much!!!

Also Smart needs to play less recklessly moving forward. His presence, switching 1 thru 5, and leadership is more important than any magical steal or block he can make.@celtics Marcus Smart if the Celtics are down at halftime https://t.co/MtdO8Apo78@celtics well we´re getting clapped https://t.co/fBvtkIO8rz@celtics No marcus?....😒Let's go CELTS!!!!!The 2021-2022 Boston Celtics have the 5th highest PPG differential ever after a loss in the post season. +17.3@clarence_bowe @vMxmba @celtics overpaid@IsTonSara @celtics Need good game then@AJB2004status_ @JaireLockdown @woosoxplswin @celtics I have faith he will figure it out 😂I think we can get through this BOSC meeting in time for the @celtics tipoff.

If @MiamiHEAT win, it'll probably be b/c of Adebayo. If he's the best player in the series, it's tough to see @celtics winning. If the Cs win, they'll have won a majority of the quarters over 4 games &amp; they'd be a favorite to win 2/3. https://t.co/5Y7LWO9NCD@user207532 @kyrieariver @celtics @smart_MS3 It isn't Smart's fault.

But just look at what that twit said

"Just GIVE me that money"

If it’s the @MiamiHEAT it’s a prison football game but if it’s @celtics it’s elite defense 🤣🤣🤣@TTolman @lakersdana As a 32 year old man watching these Lakers all these years, I can assure you our beef is with the Boston Celtics, I definitely agree that the LA-Bay Area rivalry is what you say, but that takes a backseat when it comes to Basketball 
I can live if the Warriors win, but not Boston@miaheatbeat @MiamiHEAT @celtics @ckparrot The quarters thing is another stupid example of NBA media regurgitating stats without any thought as to their significance. Which team won the most 8 minute, 6 minute, 4 minute or 2 minute intervals? Any of those would be a better predictor of a game result than quarters.All hail the Celtics
 @celtics@OfficialNBARefs @MiamiHEAT @celtics @ABCNetwork Foster is called the extender for a reason Celtics have not lost a Scott foster led crew game all season AND the home team has an 80% when percentage in Kane Fitzgerald officiated games.

#BleedGreenWhy is this narrative still a thing? @espn @ESPNNBA which team finished with most points when the clock struck 00:00 at the end of the 4th quarter in the 3 games? Miami Heat: 2 wins, Boston Celtics: 1. Since when are we talking about quarters being more important than games? https://t.co/Zxg91hT4qZGood morning @celtics. Lets get this W plz ☘️☘️☘️☘️1U - Boston Celtics ML / Al Horford 2+ Assists

The leaps of a frog and the athleticism of a naked dick can give the @celtics a serious advantage in todays game 4.

#NBAPlayoffs@LockedOnHeat @Kenny16Techs @celtics fans and the media @ESPNNBA @FirstTake @undisputed @NBAonTNT are all delusional. This is not a valid take for basketball.

Idc who plays or not for either team. Just win, @celtics.Celtics being dirty cause they’re sacred #NBAPlayoffs @celtics @paytonpritch3 they hunted jimmys knee. Still lost! https://t.co/210VVs4qDsSomeone needs to tell @jaytatum0 and his @celtics teammates. If they want to win the @NBA Championship, they must learn to play through pain.

There is very little room for having an off game.

You have to try and be consistent for the duration of the #NBAPlayoffs..

Tucker is playing the 1 when Tatum makes move the zone players are helping him
Tatum makes pass @Celtics missing to many shots

They making it hard on JT rest need step up with all attention on himLet’s try this again but slightly different, the BOSTON CELTICS play basketball today 🍀If I were the Boston Celtics I would simply win a basketball game today.Need the @celtics to turn up today@BdtBoston @KeithSmithNBA So what that say of KD not really showing up for 3 games in a row.

The @celtics need figure out the box &amp; 1 zone defense being played

The 1 stays on Tatum when he makes his move the zone player helps so he is never 1 on 1 

When he passes players are missing easy looks@BleacherReport @celtics Hey Jason give him his Binky back or better still buy another one@KeyJayandMax @maxkellerman @RealJayWilliams @WilnerRadio So when are we going to get to discussing the monumental win for the Miami #HEAT over the fully stocked Boston Celtics in Boston Friday night?

@NBAonTNTLike I said 2 weeks ago, Golden State will beat Dallas in 4 games in spite of Luca Doncic breaking all sorts of records but the Boston Celtics have a chance in beating Golden State in 7 games. Should be an amazing final playoff series between Boston and Golden State.@benji_f91 @DisputedTakesTM @NBA @warriors @chicagobulls Jordan scored 63 on @celtics in playoffs but still lost. All other dominant pairings took time to create and gel into powerful duos. @StephenCurry30 got drafted in 2009 but took five years to claim @nba. it takes time.
