If @MiamiHEAT win, it'll probably be b/c of Adebayo. If he's the best player in the series, it's tough to see @celtics winning. If the Cs win, they'll have won a majority of the quarters over 4 games &amp; they'd be a favorite to win 2/3. https://t.co/5Y7LWO9NCD@user207532 @kyrieariver @celtics @smart_MS3 It isn't Smart's fault.

But just look at what that twit said

"Just GIVE me that money"

The whole problem is right there. He thinks anybody that has more than him was GIVEN that and they didn't EARN it.

He has zero clue about effort and earning anything.üèÄüá∫üá∏Pronostici Playoffs Basket NBA: gare 4 Boston Celtics-Miami Heat e Dallas Mavericks-Golden State Warriors
