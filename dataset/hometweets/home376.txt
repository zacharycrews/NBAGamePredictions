Let's play a game.

The franchise (not just Sacramento era) has a winning record against 19 of 40 total opponents.

1. How many of those 19 are current NBA teams?
2. Which current team has the worst percentage against the Kings?

Don't cheat, please.@BobbyTwoKenobi Yep, never had a @SacramentoKings Competition we could enter. They still need to set up an international fans day, where we all go over once in a while. Maybe I’ll make some callsThe Magic will need to defend the paint well and look after the ball much better tonight as they travel to Sacramento to face the Kings.

Check out tonight’s Game Preview and key points if the Magic are to walk out with a win👇🏻
