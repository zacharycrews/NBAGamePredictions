Pathetic franchise @trailblazers get your 💩 together@trailblazers @CarMax I’m a #RipCity fan win or lose it’s all love ❤️@DidPony71 @Ang31in3 @trailblazers @Timberwolves What a great thing for her!@Goducks21377212 @TooGrrey @dolo_johnny @trailblazers @CarMax You’re thinking of Blazers Seth. Watch his highlights this year. His game expanded. We don’t have a playmaker with Ben out &amp; he creates through PnR with Embiid. Averaging 16/3/3 shooting above 50%. Not flashy handles but gets to his spot and hits. Not a $20m difference worth@DidPony71 @Ang31in3 @trailblazers @Timberwolves Very cool!!@DidPony71 @Ang31in3 @trailblazers @Timberwolves Better? https://t.co/eJsGVigQok@DidPony71 @Ang31in3 @trailblazers @Timberwolves Congratulations! That’s very cool!Portland Trail Blazers guard CJ McCollum is showing improvement in his recovery from a pneumothorax (right lung) and will be re-evaluated in a week, the team says.@mlstello @trailblazers @CarMax Yes, but it’s okay to say we suck, those who don’t are oblivious. Offense used to be fun to watch, now both sides of the ball are ugly"You can cross one name off the Portland Trail Blazers general manager search."

#RipCity https://t.co/Wip7aPvmJnCJ McCollum injury update: 
https://t.co/sbSlhJhmQy@HinkieforPres53 @TooGrrey @dolo_johnny @trailblazers @CarMax lol that’s 🧢. Seth can’t create his own shot like CJ, doesn’t have his midrange, doesn’t have his handles. Nobody in the world would take Seth over CJ, and Seth is just a spot up shooter@RealThomMcCurdy @Ang31in3 @trailblazers @Timberwolves Have the day you deserve. Check yourself next time and maybe not fucking scream at someone.@Goducks21377212 @TooGrrey @dolo_johnny @trailblazers @CarMax We have Seth Curry at 8m compared to CJs 30m. Seth gives 90% of what CJ. Numbers back me up. The few sixers fans that want CJ are just impatient and outcasts. Reports already came out Philly has 0 interest in CJ as the headliner for Ben. You can look it up if you’d like@JasonStrummer @Ang31in3 @trailblazers @Timberwolves Jahahaha. I don’t like it.Not giving up, just curious. I know the @trailblazers first round pick this year is lottery protected, but once it has been determined we are keeping the pick, can you trade it? Like this summer. @pdxTimmay do you know? Anyone?@DidPony71 @Ang31in3 @trailblazers @Timberwolves See  - I can send you a respectful tweet.    

It feels wrong  - but  I've proven it's possible.@JasonStrummer @Ang31in3 @trailblazers @Timberwolves Thank you.@BleacherReport @wojespn What the fuck @trailblazers@RealThomMcCurdy @Ang31in3 @trailblazers @Timberwolves Thank you so much for mansplaining something she already knows what to do.

For better or for worse, our hearts are with the Portland Trail Blazers.
@trailblazers@trailblazers historically cp3 has owned dame@Hear4Sports @FreskoGabo @trailblazers The problem is that’s just how Portland is. Dame played how he needs in the 4th (rest of the game is questionable lol) but if anybody else could make a free throw, that game doesn’t go to overtime. The team as a whole has been bad, Dame included I agree@JustinLeise @trailblazers Dame has lost maybe 10 games for us this yr just chucking up off balanced threes, giving opposing teams momentum off bad shots@Pravintime @trailblazers thats not whats gonna happen lmao@trailblazers Neil Olshey should be charged with criminal neglect.#Portland Trail Blazers - Phoenix Suns ★ #Tiempo Adicional empezado: 102 - 102 ★ by: #SofaScore@trailblazers Need to make our free throws.@FreskoGabo @trailblazers he was garbage when it counted. he's getting old and he's not as skilled as cp3 currys@trailblazers Just gotta move forward onto the next one #ripcity@Dwaiders @JustinLeise @trailblazers I do, he was ASSSSSS  should’ve kept nance in..@trailblazers Great Game..🏀 https://t.co/wNDtXyNTky@trailblazers Dame didn’t have it tonight but still was solid.

So frustrating.@dawshizznle @trailblazers Do we even have a first?@Lankins21 @FreskoGabo @trailblazers lol what did you watch? Dame shooting less than 39% on the year and was worse than that today. Adjusted for volume might be the worst offensive player in the nba this year. Russ shooting 45% by the way and ppl are killing him in the media. it’s crazy. Dame has been BAD@___CmonBruh___ @Lankins21 @FreskoGabo @trailblazers Ya but Norman miss that crucial last free throw if he made it it could of been a win instead of a lost@trailblazers Its Time to tank 1 year please@AaronNicholas10 @trailblazers Sell the franchise@trailblazers Snell and RoCo did not see the ball again after making some 3s. Is that a coaching issue?@trailblazers pls get rid of nurk. bra plays 0 defense.@bigcapper5 @trailblazers He shot 35% and 31%, I would get 30 too shooting that much and missing, he choked in OT too, just let him take the surgery and call of the season.

He’s going to get occasionally hot from outside but that’s it. He’s never learned to make his teammates better. He has the mentality that he has to get his points instead of making the right play.@trailblazers 64% from the free throw line. And everyone says Dame needs to get out of Portland but he’s ass now too. Dame 21 on less than 39% shooting after today or Westbrook 19 on 45% shooting. Team is garbage. Might be fighting for that too pick when it’s said and doneFinal 📊

The @trailblazers came back in the second half to get the lead late in the game but 4 missed free throws in the final minutes and OT killed us. One good sign for tonight was Dame and Norm combining for 54 points. Onto the next. https://t.co/viZ2svIMCN@BBW_Candi @trailblazers @Suns Definitely understood on that too. Portland doesn't seem to care to help. Just like my Knicks, don't wanna help Julius@DollaIgnited @trailblazers I want him stay but sadly I think he’ll leave eventually idk how but he’s leaving@trailblazers Portland gave another one away.@JustinLeise @trailblazers Agree bro you tell fact'sDeandre Ayton and Chris Paul Highlight Phoenix Suns Clutch Win over Portland Trail Blazers https://t.co/Wese1vZAM7@blazersfaithful @trailblazers Next 3 Memphis, CHA then Memphis again@Suns and @trailblazers

The rule needs to be changed, imo. If you’re up 3+ with under a minute to go, intentional fouls should be given 2 shots plus the ball or straight 3 free-throws. Fans want to see those last shots.

W for Phoenix, but an L for the fans.@FreskoGabo @trailblazers how he get a 30 point double double &amp; didnt carry the team?? scored 13 in the fourth alone@trailblazers A certain someone @SnellSeason knows got you a decent lead then exited just in time for it to be evaporated.  🤦🏼‍♂️Make ya free throws 🥺 @trailblazers@trailblazers Same trash the past 20 years@trailblazers We suck@rbm531 @trailblazers This new coach does.
