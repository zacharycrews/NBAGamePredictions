#glorydaysapparel #buzzcity #allfly #hornets #charlottehornets #CLT https://t.co/7RsTEiYOEiI wonder if @CrownClubCLT could have a hashtag or something for hornets fans to sell their tickets to other hornets fans, without all those ridiculous fees from Ticketmaster. If there is something please point me in that direction. #bbtb #charlottehornets #HornetsA quick reminder regarding the Charlotte Hornets 2022 first round pick. It's a top 18 protected pick.

As per today, that pick will convey as the 20th pick. 

In my Big Board that means the New York Knicks will get Jaden Ivey out of Purdue!

Not a bad thought at all! https://t.co/w0a1xHUh4zNovember 18, 2020: The NBA held the 1st ever virtual draft where the Minnesota #Timberwolves took Georgia SG Anthony Edwards #1 overall, Golden State #Warriors selected C James Wiseman #2, and Charlotte #Hornets got G LaMelo Ball at #3
