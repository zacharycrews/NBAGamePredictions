So you have no factual evidence and presenting photos that you do not know if there is direct correlation to incident.

So...you are not the investigator on the case, huh?

How about we let those actually investigating the case investigate the case. 🤷🏿‍♂️🤷🏿‍♂️@StimmiHendrix @Kyleh324 @sklawitt2002 @SacramentoKings its still gun violence@SacramentoKings @warriors @NBA in light of the mass shooting and since it happened so close to golden 1, i don’t think the kings/warriors game should happen tonight, especially since the suspect is still at large@sklawitt2002 @SacramentoKings still gun violence lil bro@GoatJames__ @HaterMuse Kings hate.

Illegal gun ✅, armed while intoxicated ✅, murder ✅. So why does the overwhelming ignorant answer always seems to be more laws will solve the problem.@StimmiHendrix @ireraiz @Kyleh324 @sklawitt2002 @SacramentoKings So, you are just assuming without direct knowledge or any factual released information.

If you need a streamer at power forward, @TreyLyles has been playing well as a starter recently and has an impressive per-game average in various statistical categories. He has averaged 14 PPG, 8.1 RPG, and 2.6 APG over the past seven games. https://t.co/4bbWnvS1XP@thatl0calguy Lottery odds are not a guarantee that you will get the first pick, heck it’s not even a guarantee that you will get a top five pick..these games mean something still they are not out of the play-in or playoffs yet. @sactowncrown @SacramentoKings @toomuchgame_BG @KingsNationCP@RoyalsSac206Fan @SacramentoKings De aaron boutta be my best friend 😂Imagine @SacramentoKings winning the NBA championship at home .. just look at what @tylerthecreator did!!

Those were the 8 years Rick Adelman was coach.

Think about that. Not a single different coach has led the team to a winning regular season record.Game-Time Decisions: Sacramento Kings (29-49) Vs. Golden State Warriors  (49-29) Sunday, April 3, 2022.

The Pelicans franchise is about to be bankrupt, shut down and relocated. Hope you find another team. Maybe the Sacramento Kings. You will be used to the poverty and losingI would like to take a moment to congratulate the Sacramento Kings. They won’t make the playoffs, but this is the longest they’ve lasted in a season before being mathematically eliminated. Baby steps folks@AndoliniNFT @SacramentoKings @LazyLionsNFT @NBA Enjoy my man 👌@Vonnyy2000 @BootlegWiFii @YeemBaz @Dat_Dude259 @toolateyk @MrMatthewCFB @WorldWideWob I rather live in New York than a city that will be underwater in a decade. Also the Pelicans had Anthony Davis and CP3 two top 75 players of all time and won nothing, That's embarrassing. The Pelicans are just like the Sacramento Kings.

The best team to be robbed of a championship. You feel me? @BBruh916 @BetsJoshy @Hovaallen29 @coachterry42 @JSteez916Seen a lot of mock drafts having the Sacramento Kings taking AJ Griffin. After watching him tonight, we def need to get top 6 at least to ensure we can take Benn Mathurin.
