🍽️ : @Hooters 🦉 https://t.co/TVt9IHjwy6The Wizards are 29-38, 4 GB on the 10th seed Charlotte Hornets. They have a 7% chance of making the playoffs, according to https://t.co/PtmARFwcQa, with 15 games left.

If they lose to the Denver tonight, that slides to 5%.

A pitiful end to what was once a very promising season. https://t.co/mIVh2sMLbv@TvegasTheGreat @hornets new york doesnt have the vaccine mandate, they lifted it. But they have a private sector mandate, meaning any business can mandate it which is why kyrie still cant play. Its so dumb🙄Just got my tickets for Saturday's game @hornets versus @dallasmavs can't wait. Let's get it Buzz City!!!!

#DubNation https://t.co/ITlLPij5Nr@B3Childers @BullsSource Feb 9th against the hornets in Charlotte was the last time bulls made 15+ 3’s@PaulJKlosterman @hornets @AGoldFan I don’t think that’s exactly true. Certainly, the fans didn’t like Shinn and they wouldn’t support his desire for a new arena. But it didn’t keep them away that much.  In the last three years before NO the team was good and fun. The fans were there.@hornets @T_Rozzay3 Bros the biggest front runner I’ve seen@hornets @iamnickrichards announce kyrie Irving@AlecCampbell5, your point about owners not caring about fans' opinions may very well be true, but please be reminded that, in the waning years of George Shinn's ownership of the @Hornets, fans stayed away in droves because of their opinion of the owner.  CC:  @AGoldFan.@hornets @T_Rozzay3 Got my tickets Pisces Time... 03/14...@avlev124 Your Charlotte Hornets.@iamnickrichards shares a story about a strong woman that he looks up to for #WomensHistoryMonth

#AllFly https://t.co/0RT7LWi77uAbout last night… @MELOD1P scoring one of his four 3’s of the night as the @hornets beat OKC 134 to 116. The energy in the arena was wild and the Hornets played a great game. https://t.co/0fn9ecpJh8@toluflash12 @macwfnz @DuncOnDemand Breaking news…Deshaun Watson to Panthers, gave up 3 1’s, Jeremy Chinn, Brian Burns, JC Horn, Charlotte Hornets, Carolina Hurricanes, 1 yr. of Cam Newton’s wardrobe, and the unfinished Panthers practice facility in Rock Hill, SC.@aish__1998 @jusrebel @Eternity9 @hornets Most of them don’t even know ballI need a couple of @hornets fans for a video Idea!! tag hornets fans 
#BuzzCity #hornets #NBA75  #COMMENT/r/CharlotteHornets: Purchase Season Tickets #AllFly https://t.co/gN6f8lzxJ0@Eternity9 @BennieSEdwards1 @hornets More like damage control/revisionist history. I know what you’re talking about, but I think the direct quote from his manager before the draft saying he wouldn’t play for the hornets if drafted there carries more weight.@willy41098 @BennieSEdwards1 @hornets The story came out in more recent years how that was a lie. You can Google it.@jasonwrichards @hornets @themiller46 That was a great OT game! If we play Boston in the playoffs let’s make it happen. If not, next season.@jsk1030 @hornets @themiller46 The last away game I went to was when I sat by you all in Dallas right before Covid. Long time since then!@jsk1030 @hornets @themiller46 I’ve always wanted to hit TD Garden. I think that’s tops on my list. Followed by MSG.Tomorrow we face off against our division rival @hornets.

We look to end the season series 3-1 and go above .500

Against the Hornets: 

Trae Young: 24.7 PTS | 9.3 AST | 43.8% 3FG
