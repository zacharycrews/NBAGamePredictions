üçΩÔ∏è : @Hooters ü¶â https://t.co/TVt9IHjwy6The Wizards are 29-38, 4 GB on the 10th seed Charlotte Hornets. They have a 7% chance of making the playoffs, according to https://t.co/PtmARFwcQa, with 15 games left.

If they lose to the Denver tonight, that slides to 5%.

A pitiful end to what was once a very promising season. https://t.co/mIVh2sMLbv@TvegasTheGreat @hornets new york doesnt have the vaccine mandate, they lifted it. But they have a private sector mandate, meaning any business can mandate it which is why kyrie still cant play. Its so dumbüôÑJust got my tickets for Saturday's game @hornets versus @dallasmavs can't wait. Let's get it Buzz City!!!!

#DubNation https://t.co/ITlLPij5Nr@B3Childers @BullsSource Feb 9th against the hornets in Charlotte was the last time bulls made 15+ 3‚Äôs@PaulJKlosterman @hornets @AGoldFan I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs exactly true. Certainly, the fans didn‚Äôt like Shinn and they wouldn‚Äôt support his desire for a new arena. But it didn‚Äôt keep them away that much.  In the last three years before NO the team was good and fun. The fans were there.@hornets @T_Rozzay3 Bros the biggest front runner I‚Äôve seen@hornets @iamnickrichards announce kyrie Irving@AlecCampbell5, your point about owners not caring about fans' opinions may very well be true, but please be reminded that, in the waning years of George Shinn's ownership of the @Hornets, fans stayed away in droves because of their opinion of the owner.

#BuzzCity #hornets #NBA75  #COMMENT/r/CharlotteHornets: Purchase Season Tickets #AllFly https://t.co/gN6f8lzxJ0@Eternity9 @BennieSEdwards1 @hornets More like damage control/revisionist history. I know what you‚Äôre talking about, but I think the direct quote from his manager before the draft saying he wouldn‚Äôt play for the hornets if drafted there carries more weight.@willy41098 @BennieSEdwards1 @hornets The story came out in more recent years how that was a lie. You can Google it.@jasonwrichards @hornets @themiller46 That was a great OT game! If we play Boston in the playoffs let‚Äôs make it happen. If not, next season.@jsk1030 @hornets @themiller46 The last away game I went to was when I sat by you all in Dallas right before Covid. Long time since then!@jsk1030 @hornets @themiller46 I‚Äôve always wanted to hit TD Garden. I think that‚Äôs tops on my list. Followed by MSG.Tomorrow we face off against our division rival @hornets.

We look to end the season series 3-1 and go above .500
