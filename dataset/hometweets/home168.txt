Love these matchups for 2 teams playing at home that are much better in these matchups. Curry got da clip and Derozan is like that.Golden State Warriors have agreed to a contract buyout with Pascal Siakam, league sources tell ESPN.The LA Clippers, Golden State Warriors, and Phoenix Suns are all tied for the longest winning streak in the NBA - 5 games.The Golden State Warriors are currently ranked 1st in offense and 2nd in defense. 

It’s early, but wow.Candace Parker perfectly predicts Golden State Warriors star Steph Curry’s 50-point night https://t.co/FNamBBRz2gGolden State Warriors have agreed to a contract buyout with Kendrick Nunn, per sources.@Thr33TTD NBA team? Orlando Magic and Golden State Warriors. Favorite player? Steph CurryGolden State Warriors are title contenders, in my view.@allenpaul102 @samGrande89 @OldManAndThree @ACFresh21 That’s bc it was all Heat/Warriors at that time. &amp; they had a lot of money tied up in Kobe (may he Rest In Peace). No vet was taking minimum contracts to play there. Everyone wanted to be on Miami or Golden State. People will come to play with AD once Bron done.@warriors That’s how it’s done, no. 1 Golden State Warriors Oak TownGolden State Warriors Jordan Brand Long Sleeve Black
