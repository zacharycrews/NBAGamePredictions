Spurs get a backup to DeJounte Murray with size that can play alongside him at times. After the development of DeJounte, Daniels feels like a safe long term bet to shoot at some point and adds asset flexibility. https://t.co/yTvytaClPd[Live] 2022 NBA Basketball San Antonio Spurs Vs Toronto Raptors 👉 ▶️ : https://t.co/vGfkNhXZWU | 9-Mar-22 @ 20:30 | Toronto Raptors | San Antonio Spurs | NBA | Basketball https://t.co/mRHWPX7imnMilwaukee Bucks - Atlanta Hawks
