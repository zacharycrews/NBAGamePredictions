@jacobmckenna99 on where he is seeing value for this matchup:
https://t.co/LauGRkP4bM@epark1016 @_JasonLT You cannot be so foolish as to ignore Russell Westbrook’s salary. Washington Wizards unloaded 44 million dollars this season and 47 million dollars next season. Lakers don’t need a point guard THAT BAD.
Sharpshooter was cheaper.Have the Washington Wizards looked at their roster? It’s only Bradley Beal and Kyle Kuzma https://t.co/D67rBECZ4dFeb 10.

Washington Wizards@soni_maxx @chicagobulls @NBCSChicago @2Xtremebounce Yup! I would also watch out for a potential Harrell move from the wizards since Beal is now injured and Harrell is on an expiring contract. Send Washington one or two second round picks not first.@TheHoopCentral @billoram I just find it crazy. GM Lebron made a trade to get Russ from Washington and getting rid of Kuzma. Now Lebron wants Russ out and loss Kuzma which is having a insane season with the wizards@brka7777 @LakerCentral365 I am saying keep that same energy as the beginning of the season, continue to recognize Russell Westbrook as a STAR PLAYER. 😁😁😁 He was that for the Washington Wizards, doesn't fit with the Lakers 2020 Championship point guard.Washington hates Russ? Every Wizards fan I’ve talked to wants Russ back lmaooo https://t.co/ApB4RyIv8OGameThread: Miami Heat (34-20) @ Washington Wizards (24-28) https://t.co/CUGEh2kafkWashington Wizards All-Star guard Bradley Beal plans to undergo season-ending surgery on his left wrist, sources tell ESPN.@TheNBACentral Washington flipped John Wall, the worst contract in the league, into good young talent via Russ. Plus they got a post season out of him. Along with that I went to two Wizards road games last year and all the Wizards fans loved him. So how does DC hate him?
