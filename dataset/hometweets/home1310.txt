1u Dallas Mavericks 1H -2.5 -115

Dallas has to win this one and Warriors is only good in the 3rd and 4th quarter. Last game they won the first half by 14 points and Luka will look for a great start again to possibly go 2-1 in the series

I do believe the warriors can win tonight but if they start playing sloppy it’s overThe Dallas Mavericks are 5-1 ATS in the #NBAPlayoffs and when they covered in those games, they covered by an average margin of +15.4 ppg. That's pretty astounding.

I'd expect a fantastic effort from Dallas tonight.

I believe that is not valid reasoning, so set out to rebut it.

There are 1001 reasons why any of us do or don't like specific sports. But I'm not about to let false reasoning go.BRON DAILY TAKE #00055

As a fan of @KingJames , the best case scenario of this Playoffs would be @dallasmavs winning it all, if @MiamiHEAT wins it, that's alright, if it is a BOS-GSW Finals, I have to root for BOS, I don't want to see any active players catching Bron in rings.The Dallas Mavericks  trailed the Golden State Warriors by 19 points, but Warriors rallied to win with the help of Stephen Curry's 32 points and six three-pointers.
