I also kinda view him as 6’10” Klay Thompson.@MiamiHEAT who starting@icecus @DadeTeflonDon @MiamiHEAT After the 78th twisted / sprain you would think this would be a bigger concern lol. He stays wearing those...@TheMageech @MiamiHEAT idk why we haven't already locked up the 2nd coming of T-Mac (with Wade's defense) to a 10 year contract. NEVER let him go @MiamiHEATThis is fascinating to me, I don't think it's a given that the Heat should extend, let alone max extend Herro. He's in a totally optimized offensive role for Miami, and also has a team that limits his defensive downside - despite that he's still a below-average efficiency player. https://t.co/z8z3L6Pl5s@MiamiHeat_LATAM Donde ta P FKN R?@MiamiHeat_LATAM Langford better.#MIAvsOKC

Just because Rozier was working out in Miami didn't make the Heat fans think that there were signing him. This is LaMelo team and he will win multiple championships in Charlotte.Shai Gilgeous-Alexander is another PG playing at a high level. Watch for him in these next couple #OKCThunder games.

People still walking in at halftime. I expect no difference tonight.@MiamiHEAT @FTX_Official I’ll be there. Hope #HEATCulture is in there at 8pm tipoff. Heat legit is making as many home games as possible start that late to give you all a chance to make it on time, yet you’ll just show up at 830-9 instead of 8-830 for a standard 730 tip-off. It’s truly sad. #HeatTwitter https://t.co/vxkD2TFlBtMiami Heat Weekly Round-Up - Butler struggling, Herro getting to the line and more https://t.co/CchxzMPsjU@KamBrothers @highkin The Vice @MiamiHEAT jerseys are by far the best jerseys to come out  on the last few years@matthewfdz You’re about to have your @MiamiHEAT fandom revoked.@JabbaDuhHo @MiamiHEAT Ratio8:00pm ET; Fri, Mar 18

Miami is on pace for 54 wins, currently two games up on Milwaukee for the East’s No. 1 seed. Since they split the head-to-head series this year, tiebreaker would go to conference record (MIA 30-13, MIL 26-18)
