Defense has been fine without him starting. And offense has been better.@dallasmavs @ModeloUSA i more scared with lottery teams than title contenders at this point@OnlyMoSalah77 @dallasmavs @ModeloUSA true. but DP was dog shit a lot more then Maxi has been. also Maxi has been dealing with lingering injuries this year. i’m ok with DP starting but the Mavs will quickly realize that it’s important to have maxi in the starting 5 to start games.Dallas Mavericks vs Detroit Pistons Basketball Live | 2022 NBA | [Stream HD] : https://t.co/7TXQ8S6s60 | 8-Feb-22 | 20:30 | NBA | Basketball | Detroit Pistons | Dallas Mavericks https://t.co/Xodq3eHMjQ@DFleeOfficial @dallasmavs @ModeloUSA Well its called continuation &amp; sticking with whats working with good teams..

Don’t even think I’d go with the Mavericks, the Cavs, Bucks, 76ers maybe. But Dallas, that’s rough. Well done!NEWS OF THE DAY:
February 7 2022, Dallas Texas

Janice had to go to Los Angeles for a week of press appearances. She left Tom with the kids. After his first full day, he called Cindy (the neighborhood babysitter) to watch the kids while he went to the Mavericks game.

...CONT'D@fishsports @dallasmavs When was the last time the Mavs completed a big time trade?? https://t.co/Azvumq2n2H@codyclifton77 @dallas_hoops The Mavericks approached he Knicks last offseason when acquiring Bullock. Apparently the Knicks wanted compensation for having the protections removed. Which is crazy and I would have told them no as well.@isaacappelt The Dallas Mavericks
