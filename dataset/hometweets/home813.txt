February 7 2022, Dallas Texas

Janice had to go to Los Angeles for a week of press appearances. She left Tom with the kids. After his first full day, he called Cindy (the neighborhood babysitter) to watch the kids while he went to the Mavericks game.

...CONT'D@fishsports @dallasmavs When was the last time the Mavs completed a big time trade?? https://t.co/Azvumq2n2H@codyclifton77 @dallas_hoops The Mavericks approached he Knicks last offseason when acquiring Bullock. Apparently the Knicks wanted compensation for having the protections removed. Which is crazy and I would have told them no as well.@isaacappelt The Dallas Mavericks
