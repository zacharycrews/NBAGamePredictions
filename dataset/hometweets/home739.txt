He is the first player in @memgrizz franchise history to record 50+ blocks in a single calendar month. https://t.co/1Ihbml7unnThe @memgrizz have registered 5+ steals and 5+ blocks in 38 games this season, the most of any NBA team.The @memgrizz lead the @NBA in both steals per game (10.2) and blocks per game (6.4).

The Grizzlies are on pace to become the third team since 1982-83 to lead the league in both categories (2016-17 Warriors, 2007-08 Nuggets).
