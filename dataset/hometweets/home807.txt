https://t.co/NtTxv6n8T2@swansofnever @utahjazz 😂😂😂😂 not sure if we could air the unedited versionGame 6; Will it ever end?
 
The VERY NEXT DAY on February 1st, 2020 the Blazers faced the Utah Jazz, and Damian Lillard, yet again amazed us. He put up a crazy stat line of: 51 Points, 12 Assists, and 2 Rebounds.
 
This ended Dame's AMAZING run where he averaged 48.8 points. https://t.co/S4nErgnbwxnba bet:

Who gets an A+ and who deserves an F? 📃 https://t.co/t8unUQPZqjJulius Randle's Points in his last 5 games vs. Utah Jazz: 
32, 53, 43, 32, 43 😳😤 https://t.co/clnDq7kmAS@TmanKy Those are good arguments. I just personally don't see it. I would love nothing more than for the Utah Jazz to trade for him and prove me wrong by going to the finals with him. I'd be surprised to see it though.@SacreBleu27 @JazzJargon I personally hate the Jerami Grant fit for the Utah Jazz imo but I would be more than happy to be proven wrong if the Jazz actually trade for him and then make the finals with him.@TmanKy I don't think Eric Gordon moves the needle enough for the Utah Jazz. The Jazz need to get longer, younger, &amp;/or better defensively imo.

33 year old 6'3 inconsistent shooter Eric Gordon at 20/mil for the next 2 years isn't it for the Jazz IMO.The Jazz take on the Knicks tonight at 6:30pm!
