I like the Spurs and the over in Charlotte. Hornets 1-9 last 10 home games. Both teams up tempo and should race up and down the floor.@JimGrayOfficial Currently reading your book. I love it. I’m 54 and lived through all of this. Found an error. You mentioned that Kobe was drafted straight out of high school by the Lakers. He was in fact selected by the Charlotte Hornets and traded.NBA parlay:

Charlotte Hornets
Miami Heat 
Under 235.5 Timberwolves
$5 for $18.36Charlotte Hornets PG LaMelo Ball could probably lace up for Charlotte FC tonight and instantly be their best player. 

But something in the air tells me they’ll get at least a draw tonight vs LA Galaxy, thanks to the expected crazy atmosphere. https://t.co/hQL1ANyOqAPortland traded their whole team for nothing. Any non-all star can be traded at a low cost
