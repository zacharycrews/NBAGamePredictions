Nobody is going to interrupt my game.@spidey_12321 @GodlLotus @warriors Bro, it’s just the first round. Steph will come back when we need him full time. So far, we don’t.

Bucks, Suns... and Warriors. 

Why Game 1 against Denver was just Golden State scratching the surface of its potential: 

https://t.co/KQAcS1ViliTenth play of the day

1u Golden State Warriors -7 -110

Golden State is by far the better team and too experienced to make it close at home. They will drive a worn out Jokic around the floor and make him tired, the Nuggets are nothing if Jokic struggles

#GamblingTwitterBetter see a lot of yellow t shirts @warriors@baby_bamnr So, golden state want to spread their wings to entertainment industry and also for the documentary and all for the warriors team.

But Chase center is louder even, nit much less crowds.@MidrangeMalone @Tombradyfan69_ @Warriors_Guru @warriors Exactly my point.  I loved Oracle, sure, we all did.  But Chase can get super loud too.  People just trying to fake their way into looking credible by throwing out a generic rich vs poor comment without knowing anything about the reality.@Warriors_Guru @warriors Seats probably expensive af in there 🤷🏾‍♂️I really hope @JonathanKuming6 gets (a lot) more playing time today

Regular season just to go enjoy a game makes sense to go with upper level though@Warriors_Guru @ggjjtt @warriors So take it and give it to someone in need or someone outside the stadium if you have so many.

The view is awesome and no one in front of you.@ggjjtt @JbsReptile @HyenaTheShovelX @Warriors_Guru @Jallenps71 @warriors $100 for good seats at a playoff game lol I need to see these seats youre talking about😂 when I looked I definitely didn't see any good seat tickets for $100@ggjjtt @HyenaTheShovelX @Warriors_Guru @Jallenps71 @warriors The chase center caters to the wealthy tech workers it’s apparent with the move to SF, abundance of luxury boxes and high tix prices. If they ever want it like Philly, Boston or what or Oracle was prices have to cater to the working class.@LilBit071213 @Warriors_Guru @warriors I have enough free shirts, towels, etc. from going to games and I don't really like wearing ones that have "Dignity Health" or whatever the sponsor is running across them.@ggjjtt @HyenaTheShovelX @Warriors_Guru @Jallenps71 @warriors 🧢 under 100 for playoff tix? You must have gotten last min resale.@Warriors_Guru @ggjjtt @warriors Exactly why I said it's something to keep because most won't put those shirts on that they leave for fans, especially at Chase. Oracle was a whole different time and atmosphere. "Weak" or not I don't see why you left it on the seat but that's your choice🤷‍♀️@JbsReptile @HyenaTheShovelX @Warriors_Guru @Jallenps71 @warriors That's such bullshit. I got tickets for under $100 a seat and they are good seats. Don't have to be rich to drop $100 on a game.@Warriors_Guru @warriors Stooooooppppp@Warriors_Guru @warriors Stop@Warriors_Guru @LilBit071213 @warriors Most people come to the game wearing jerseys, sweaters and other shirts.

He called Jordan Poole the new Kevin Durant.Golden State Warriors: 

Steph Curry, Klay Thompson, Jordan Poole, Draymond Green 

Phoenix Suns: 

Devin Booker, Chris Paul, DeAndre Ayton, Mikal Bridges. 

Yea, no one is beating these teams other than each other.

The Celtics, and/or not joining the Lakers earlier.
Russell had the supporting cast.
