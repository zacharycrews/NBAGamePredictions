Allen has a BLK in 18 of his last 19 games. Spurs allow 7th most BLKS to C‚Äôs.

Close spread is a positive as well. https://t.co/ZiFra1eBoMTheir record may not be among the league's best, but there are some bright spots about the San Antonio Spurs this season.

Great matchup here vs San Antonio as the Spurs give up lots of shots at the rim, where the Cavs excel.

The Cavs are the better team here and this should be a solid game for Jarrett Allen to put up numbers.
