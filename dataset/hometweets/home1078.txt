Trae Young Over 27.5 Points🔐

Orlando Magic vs GSW Under 216.0🔐

Hammer Trae Young. Nailed Lebron over last night. Trae has history in New York’s stadium, expecting him to have a big night. They also need a win desperately to stay in playoffs.@OrlandoMagic My Birthday is today@samdubs0 @LockedOnDubs @KylenMills @andre @warriors @OrlandoMagic I’ve been thinking the same thing. If he plays in the playoffs it was worth it and if not you know the answer.@TheeNelDog I can understand that. I was the biggest Orlando Magic fan. Never missed a game. Shaq went to LA and I stopped watching completely until he retired.@DogSurfRoadshow @LockedOnDubs @KylenMills @andre @warriors @OrlandoMagic Question: has it really been worth Andre taking up a roster spot this year?
Would he not have been more useful in a coaching/mentor role?

I’d like to see Carter play in person vs GSW but ik wym, you wanna see the Warriors vs the 76ers or something interesting🤣 not these typical blowouts that been happening@RyanBarnhart0 @JayssPlayss @andre @OrlandoMagic You said , if you could have it your way, you’d rather watch Warriors/Heat

I’m telling you those teams dont face eachother tonight, im not sure when they do, and who will even be healthy for that game

The game you CAN go see is Magic/Warriors, as i said, NBA doesnt cater to you@OrlandoMagic

Knowing that 5 years from now a bunch of the young guys on Orlando’s roster are gona be household names in the league… Glad i’m not this shortsighted!🤷🏻‍♂️🙏🏼@OrlandoMagic @FTCcollege Y’all sponsored by Disney y’all could really go crazy with these jerseys tho.some people aren’t very bright. the Orlando Magic don’t have an impact on what the third party websites and sellers want to sell tickets for. the Magic can’t tell those sellers to lower prices, what a stupid tweet lmao https://t.co/ywQMdvIkST@andre @CedricSayings @ElysiumGY @OrlandoMagic people think Andre is talking about his own rest, and the playoffs..

but when it comes to Andre... i always assume that he's talking about those dollar 💵 first?
