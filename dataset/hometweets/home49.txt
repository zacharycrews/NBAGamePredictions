$100 to win $295.35 💰💸Philadelphia 76ers vs New York Knicks 2021-22 NBA Season Preview, Predictions and Picks | SportsNus https://t.co/LxuDIRMtZ1Honestly, I like New York. 

I thought adding Fournier and Walker was smart given how it lightens the pressure on Randle to create for himself and others.

That said, I think the Bulls unload on the Knicks Thursday. 

Vuč is due for a big game.

The same could be said for LaVine.New York Knicks absolutely have to beat the Sixers tonight. No Ben Simmons anymore who is undefeated for his career against the New York Knicks. No excuses go out there and beat these guys.Good morning ! The New York Knicks play tonight !In the 38 games Rose has played for the Knicks since being acquired by New York at last season's trade deadline, Rose has shot 47-for-107 (43.9%) from 3-point territory.The New York Knicks are 1.5 point favorites vs. the a Philadelphia 76ers in MSG tonight. What a time to be alive. (Embiid day to day, as always.)🔊YERRRR…Those New York Knicks play tonight! 🔶🔷🔶🔷🗽🗽🗽 #NewYorkForever  #NYKnicksDon't expect the New York Knicks to fade this season https://t.co/EhP0uZP9CBThe New York Knicks play basketball tonight, rejoice! 🙌🏾It’s a great day because the New York Knicks play basketball this evening.

07:00 Golden State Warriors-9
07:30 Dallas Mavericks-10.5@RediTlhabi @Eusebius Well, they looked like a bunch of incongruent idiots at the first game so my take on this is that there's no I in team and cricket is a team sport. So whatever principle that Quinton is standing for I suppose it's similar to antivaxer Irvine at New York Knicks.NBA Day 8️⃣ 🏀🏀🏀

Please subscribe to @nothinbutknicks YouTube channel. 

Salute to sim, but nah Randle ain’t elite, at least not yet@blackdetta @Joe_Razza @JRuss424 @getnickwright That the Knicks are actually very popular throughout the entire city/area. Obviously, that's going to include a lot of well-off whites, but it also includes pretty much every community in New York.@brandoncrichar1 @ReddishShrug @PeeWeeDaPlug I know no Knicks fans who thought that. I live in New York (go to college in Massachusetts but still, my primary connections to the fanbase is evident). I don’t know any Knicks fans who thought that, you’re probably looking at one guy and extrapolating it to the entire fanbaseThe New York Knicks and the Houston Astros. https://t.co/uRMmdIX1ZZICYMI on ESPN NY Tonight:

@Hardestyespn and @gordondamer breakdown a busy Sunday in the Big Apple. The Giants get a big win, but the Jets and the Knicks each endure brutal losses of their own. Will things get better from here for New York sports?
