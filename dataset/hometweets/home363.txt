Crowder started the period hot, but Phoenix is letting San Antonio hang around in this one. They do have a +13 advantage on the boards. Just need to focus in the final period. 

Crowder: 16 PTS, 3-7 3Ps
Paul: 11/8/2
McGee: 11 PTS, 6 REBSSuns held the Spurs to 37 points in the middle quarters after San Antonio scored 33 in the first quarterIt‚Äôs 2021. I‚Äôve just witnessed San Antonio Spur, Bryn Forbes, quite literally turn his defenders ankle and drain the accompanying floater. 

What timeline is this? 

#PorVidaPhoenix has suffocated San Antonio since the start of the second quarter and the game is starting to slip away.

San Antonio has gone cold from deep, going 1-10 in the second period. Paul's already attacking with the midrange, working around Ayton's high screens to perfection.
