also not a lot but fishy movement on Hawks - Spurs.
Tough for me to buy this cause the Spurs are a bad 3pt team, if the Hawks are making their 3‚Äôs, it‚Äôs gon be tough. But line says Hawks either win within 5 or they‚Äôll be the turkey to San Antonio tonight. üßê#NBA #NBATwitter Today's Lineups

Spurs are only 2-5 at home, however 3 losses were by 4 or less points. I say they'll win outright. I don't want the points. I don't need the points.

My wife taught the San Antonio Spurs and had never seen an NBA game. Lynn Swann, Herschel Walker all took ballet as pros to improve.   The production we saw was beautiful. Some of the best from ABT, Cuban Ballet and Joffrey.
