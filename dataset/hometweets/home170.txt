I don't agree with the Philadelphia 76ers being favored over the Toronto Raptors tonight with all they are missing.  The 76ers are without Simmons, Embiid and Thybulle.  Plus, both Harris and Curry are questionable tonight.There has not been any traction between the Philadelphia 76ers and the Boston Celtics on a Ben Simmons deal.  https://t.co/u28bJKf3Tw1/3
