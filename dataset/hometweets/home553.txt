Enjoy 😉Rudy Gobert really tried to dribble the basketball with four Pelicans swarming around him. He's fortunate that didn't result in a steal, but gotta love New Orleans' level of activity defensively throughout this first quarter.If they wanna play small ball, you have to PUNISH them. 

Jaxson Hayes did just that with the offensive board and bucket.

Good sign since it's all reserves in for the Pelicans right now.Just heard the @PelicansNBA  announcers say that the Jazz name belongs to New Orleans.

The New Orleans Jazz were a failed franchise. The New Orleans Pelicans are a legitimately failing franchise. Stop acting entitled to a name for a team your city likely shouldn't have.Utah Jazz vs New Orleans Pelicans | NBA live stream
