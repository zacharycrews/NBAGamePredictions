Miles is love by Hornets fans but he got to get that superstar energy to go with his great talent.@s24taofeek @hornets That is why I said so many people have become so docile I never seen people so focused on sports and entertainment as well as the lives of celebrities in a time of great crisis. Pre 2021 there would been mass uprisings.@s24taofeek @hornets We as lower and middle class people have more bigger concerns once again the extreme high food, essential goods and gasoline. As well as the government blown money on other countries instead of their own people suffering. We can't sit around worrying about multi millionaires.@s24taofeek @hornets Monk is a multi millionaire like Bouknight is I doubt this is truly bothering them like that they are trying to enjoy the good life that their money are allowing F Borrego and Mitch they small potatoes to them. Those two are going be stars in the NBA regardless.#Pelicans road trip continues in #charlotte as they face the #hornets

#NBA https://t.co/PHbkXkIKGg@s24taofeek @hornets We thought what happened to Monk was going to be the worst rookie treatment but what they are doing to Bouknight is disastrous. Bouknight is actually a top 5 draft level player not just a low lottery pick. Bouknight actually have the ability to be a second All Star for the team.New Orleans Pelicans vs Charlotte Hornets | NBA Live stream

Mitch and Borrego need to move on Jordan need to sell the team@s24taofeek @hornets No Monk had it better than Bouknight he just wasn't elevated to starter like he was supposed to be. He was supposed to be Melo starting shooting guard last season with Monk been 6'3 and a must better shooter than Rozier/Graham.New Orleans Pelicans visits Charlotte Hornets Predictions and Preview for 3/21/2022 today.  Who are we taking in this game?  Find out now. #Picks #Sportsbook https://t.co/ZBFgRdZzZ3@s24taofeek @hornets In all the years of the Hornets I never seen a lottery pick treated this bad. Monk at least got 10 minutes every game his rookie year never sent to the G league or sat out of games. Only when he suffered a injury he sat out. Bouknight is going through Hell.@s24taofeek @hornets Bouknight is getting treated worst than Monk. Bouknight actually was passed over as a top 5-7 pick so he is more a top 5 pick than just 11 like Monk, PJ and Miles. Monk still had more playing time his rookie year the problem was Kemba needed him as a starting shooting guard.Didn't watch this one but it seems wild and also like super long. Kid has a cool Charlotte Hornets shirt.

1. He should be coming off of the bench for Terry and take ALL of Cody’s minutes.
