23.00 https://t.co/CLwEzYZBl6The Sacramento Kings hold an 11-50 record vs the San Antonio Spurs since the beginning of the 2002-2003 season.

Sacramento has one season series win during that timespan (2018-19 season; 3-0).

Sac +1
- Kings are the better team in second half of game.  Though they also shoot so well this could be a blowout from the beginning.  
- if not, Kings will beat them in the 4th quarter.

PUTTING SAN ANTONIO ON THE MAP just like the @spursSo Spurs have recalled Primo, but he'll likely be back for the Austin Spurs' home opener against Mexico City on Sunday. Probably more of a practice move so he gets in practice with San Antonio and is available if neededThe San Antonio Spurs have recalled rookie combo guard Josh Primo from the Austin Spurs, per Spurs PR.The Spurs play the Kings tonight, while Austin doesn't play again until Sunday against Mexico City.

I think you could expect Primo to return to Austin this weekend unless he plays minutes in San Antonio &amp; just does phenomenal.
