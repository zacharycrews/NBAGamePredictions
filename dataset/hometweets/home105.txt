Right now, the Suns look bad... they look tired and its lowkey normal after a final run last season, not to mention that they made some poor decisions this off season, the main one being not giving Ayton a max contract despite his performance in the post season. https://t.co/MDSbIRBw5wPregame Live: Phoenix hosts New Orleans to continue home stand | PHNX Suns https://t.co/otTWSeEIdH@Officialj0nn @TheHoopCentral So this means the Phoenix Suns in your books are NBA Champions thenLet‚Äôs go Phoenix Sun !!!Here are my EARLY Takeaways from the Phoenix Suns first 5 games.
