Mane…But the @memgrizz lead the league in steals: 9.8 per game vs. 7.6 for the @Bucks. That means we have to protect the ball a little more and force a few more turnovers than usual to get the edge.Fun fact ahead of tonite's game between @Bucks and @memgrizz: Both teams are tied for 3rd in scoring this season: 115.1 points per game.
