Washington Wizards v Houston Rockets.
#DCAboveAll | #Rockets https://t.co/cQ94uIOnuw#NBAPicks for tonight. Lots of games, little confidence in most. Here's where the edge lays:

🏀 Orlando #Magic +9.5
🏀 Washington #Wizards -7.5
🏀 San Antonio #Spurs +7.5
🏀 Atlanta #Hawks -2.5

#NBA Record this week: 7-7 (+2.1U)So Washington Admirals… 

At least they went the cooler route when the Bullets had to change their name to Wizards yet it’s not as generically “Americana” as Capitols or Nationals.

But hands down, Mystics have the best name in Washington sports and that’s the WNBA team. https://t.co/yL5yiAr7ktSince we're dropping SNEAK PEAKS here's another grail dropping 14th January... 👀.
