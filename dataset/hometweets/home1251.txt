Gary Trent Jr Over 13.5 Points 

GTJ is due for a breakout game. His scoring threat will spread the floor for the Raps.

Danny Green 3+ threes 

He hit 6 threes on his return to Toronto last time out. The volume will be there since Thybulle will be out.Philadelphia 76ers Vs Toronto Raptors | Game 3 | Live Play By Play https://t.co/p37yrrSUbC via @YouTube#TangerineFanAngle 4 generations of raptor fans all in one pic, all celebrating their birthday today on 420 ... go #torontoraptors #wethenorth!!! https://t.co/Zp7e6Gb5Ae@SmellMyTomato @Raptors There is a lot of them standing at the practice court elevator!

1.5u Toronto Raptors +3 (-125)

PHI is 5-17 ATS as a favorite over a conference opponent they previously beat by double digit in B2B meetings. TOR is 5-1 ATS in this condition. 
I expect TOR to get more calls at home while PHI will struggle to get some.

Wanna play aggressive “defense” don’t swat arms. There was 4 FTs attempted from questionable calls.  Especially when Embiid ran into Harden. BUT swatting arms will get them to the foul line 100%.

Can desperation carry the banged-up Raptors to victory? Read our NBA betting picks and predictions to find out.
https://t.co/IqXrL4ypn0The Raptors' defensive strategy so far this series has been centered around stopping/slowing down Embiid and Harden. The #Sixers clearly are beating that strategy using great play from Maxey and Harris. It will be interesting to see if Toronto changes up their defense in Game 3.@iknoAguy_ @NBA @sixers @Raptors The NBA after you said that https://t.co/aKlTcivxhSThe Toronto Raptors will once more be without Scottie Barnes in Game 3, but the star rookie is making progress and there is optimism he will be able to play in what could be a do-or-die Game 4.

But the Embiid foul storyline gets WAY overblown. Giannis averages nearly the same FTA per game as Embiid but the media only talks about Embiid.Scottie Barnes (rowdiness) ruled out Wednesday.

It's do or die for the Raptors, some home cooking against embiid and harden might be the right remedy to make the series 2-1 unless Maxey has anything to say about that.

#WeTheNorth https://t.co/eOFjY2fQTt@NBA @sixers @Raptors He was lazy of defence for the longest time and takes rest minutes in the paint while his team works. He has no sence or urgency, just now have we started seeing flashes of that. Its about time he perked up a bit. Shouldn't need to get kicked in the teeth to have that intensity..@Bog89arr @NBA @sixers @Raptors That’s a bullshut statement. It took a last minute shot in a game 7. Stop that bullshit right now.@JohnTory @Chum1045 @Raptors @ScotiabankArena @NBA Go Raptors go🇨🇦🏀@RoscoRaptor @NBA @sixers @Raptors Raptors fans are insufferable cry babies. It’s unfathomable to me to blame the refs when their team has gotten absolutely smoked these last 2 games.@IcyEmbeast @RoscoRaptor @NBA @sixers @Raptors Play aggressive on him and you’ll get the whistle blown on you. Simple as that@NBA @sixers @Raptors Yo real talk I respect the Heat but Embiid is by far the best player in that series so to say sixers have no shot is insanity especially considering how they exposed Tyler hero defensively last time they played. I see that as a 7 game seriesThought we cheered loudly from the couch, wait till we’re in the stands.

Raptors 103@ItsMysticz @TorontoScottie @NBA @sixers @Raptors And I said I’d take 51k a year , put my skills to work 😏@DataGoatNBA @NBA @sixers @Raptors The problem is you can't guard Joel one on one. There's no one in the league who can do that for an entire game. He's just an absolute matchup nightmare for just about everyoneI posted a video yesterday ridiculing Woj about his take on gambling having a negative impact on fan interaction with players.

However, if Toronto does not cover +2, I will be buying floor seats to Wizards/Raptors game holding a poster saying they cost me $500 in the playoffs.As for me &amp; my household, she shall serve the @Raptors 🙏🏿@emilyagard @Raptors Let's go @MiamiHEAT 

#WhiteHot@RoscoRaptor @NBA @sixers @Raptors OR HEAR ME OUT.. the second he touches the ball the Raptors send a triple team at him, he goes to finish through contact, and they’re all over him.

They had a lucky 14-18 end-of-season run. They don't have anywhere close to the amount of talent Philly has. Siakham is the team's only respectable player &amp; u know it.It's not in the best of circumstance, but the Toronto Raptors are coming home for an NBA playoff game for the first time since the 2019 Finals

After all the bitching and moaning by Nurse and Toronto fans, the Sixers gotta bury this team and make the Raptors feel unworthy of being on the same court.The 76ers are unsure what adjustments the Toronto Raptors will make in Game 3.

But they do know foul disparity will remain a major focus in the first-round series after the Raptors’ complaints following Games 1 and 2. https://t.co/JsLZ7lTdCmRT: Raptors: See y'all tonight! Get in early for your chance to win exclusive prizes including Raptors playoff tickets 👀

It is with this mentality that Raptors fans complain a lot because they think some fouls are soft and hence shouldn't be called.Wednesday

I have Jurassic park tickets but getting there 2 hours early for 6pm is gonna be tough@Raptors win tonight guysswas just researching how James harden does on Raptors court, not agaisnt raptors as a whole, just how he fares vs them but on that particular court 

interesting to find he dropped 40 pts on Toronto's court 3 diff times..35+pts on that Court 5 different timesThe Raptors return to the North in hopes of their first win of the series. 

Will Toronto get a win on home-court or will Philadelphia take a 3-0 strangle hold ?!

You want to keep shifting narrative to support your Cade trolling.  Cavs defensive rating sucked without Allen this year. You can't argue that. Mobley was assisted on over 60% of his points. Cade was unassisted on over 71% of his points.Raptors vs. 76ers: Toronto looks like a team lacking answers in second straight double-digit loss to Philly - CBS Sports https://t.co/3Qh2pmvgh8@GaryPer97322392 @dogabouttown018 @PrisonBull @0Achiuwa @rjerome217 @TaroFinch @Gee2theZ @NBA @ScottBarnes561 @Raptors @CadeCunningham_ @DetroitPistons @evanmobley @cavs Cade benefits in the box score from getting to be usage hog without all star teammates, no different than Davion Mitchell and Josh Giddey@TyR503 @dogabouttown018 @PrisonBull @0Achiuwa @rjerome217 @TaroFinch @Gee2theZ @NBA @ScottBarnes561 @Raptors @CadeCunningham_ @DetroitPistons @evanmobley @cavs Cade averaged 17, 5, and 5.

Tge Cavs defensive numbers fall off a cliff without Allen in the lineup.  The majority of Mobleys points are assisted.  These are facts.

What if the next ref is born in Toronto?@PhillyTradesman @JpConsulting4u @Raptors Yea Fred’s experience and IQ is what I’m most confident of.@WeTheNorth99 @Raptors This is so disgusting and unprofessional.

I suppose Toronto and Cleveland are huge media darlings huh lol@SpicyPisces6795 @Steve_Dangle So you’re mad because your hockey team lost to Toronto and now you flat out ignoring ish to make an irrelevant point about the 6ers and raptors? Who expected Toronto to win? Y’all got Joel and harden and 3x the free throws, you better win. Stay classy 🤣@KateBDoll That was such a dive by Embiid and James Harden. It’s so obvious @Raptors, lol 😂 

Why can’t we get proper NBA officiating? 

Way too many soft calls on Raps n #NBA refs are allowing Philly players to be physical n there’s barely any foul calls on Philadelphia.
#DoubleStandards@JpConsulting4u @CharlmaneWong @Raptors I think it might be! 😂

FVV absolutely is an elite defender; as good &amp; as fast as Maxey is, I’d expect a healthy FVV to be a serious  challenge. I mean, he’s still done fine w/ a compromised knee. 

Speed is great but experience &amp; IQ count as much if not more.@Eric__Smith @Burl_SportsHoF @PamDamoff @FAN590 @Sportsnet @Raptors @SportsnetPR @Canada LOVE this!!!  👏👏👏@PhillyTradesman @CharlmaneWong @Raptors Hey Sixers Fan! 

Is this what respectful banter looks like? 
Might we even call this discourse? 

In my opinion, Fred is an elite defender, all defensive… so I have to believe something is still nagging him 

Maxey is fast though; I’ll give you that 

#WeTheNorth 
#NBAPlayoffs@TheDukeOfSports Did you watch the @sixers and @Raptors game? Foul shots are all that matters now lol@paraaand @Raptors @NBA @NBA @NBA  watch thiss@OpenGymAnunoby @Raptors I also have a 5-0 record at Scotiabank Arena, both Leafs and Raptors. My dad has a 6-0 record. #LeafsForever #WeTheNorth@OpenGymAnunoby @Raptors Please win for Siera please. #WeTheNorth@CharlmaneWong @JpConsulting4u @Raptors I’m a Sixers fan, (don’t shoot,) but I agree w/ my favorite enemy ⬆️😉

to me, it looks like FVV’s knee is still an issue. 

Even healthy he’d can’t keep up w/ Maxey, but he could move laterally &amp; pivot for position. He also seemed to be fighting it more as the game went on@HockridgeWill @nbatopshot @Raptors @sixers 8 more FTs@WingerAlberta True story. And the ones bashing the Leafs are all Blue Jays and Raptors fans. If you’re gonna love 2 Toronto teams don’t go dissing the other.. 🤷‍♂️@HockridgeWill @nbatopshot @Raptors @sixers Probably 22@Raptors Don't let Embid bully the team geezz he hasn't won anything and I bet Scottie Barnes will win Championship first than him. #WeTheNorth https://t.co/TsVsUFDhfNFastbreak points through 2 games:
Philly: 51
Toronto: 20

Raptors have to be smarter about seeing numbers when they’re crashing offensive boards and picking up checks in transition. It’s literally kept them from staying in games.It is @devong975 and you from now until Midnight! reacting to the Sixers-Raptors series, discussing them heading out to Toronto for games 3 and 4, and more. Join him at 610-632-0975!@Raptors  Players are SOFT, weak and getting bullied by someone who hasn't one a championship,,, and they're letting him do it 🙄🤪👎🏻 https://t.co/TsVsUFDhfN@PHLSportsFan @Raptors Thanks man!

Hill had the advantage of playing at Duke and being a media darling. Cade has numbers that are very close to Hill but doesn't get same consideration. It's fine. The Pistons have Cade so I'm happy.@shawntkd @Raptors ouch, sick burn dude.@Eric__Smith @Burl_SportsHoF @PamDamoff @FAN590 @Sportsnet @Raptors @SportsnetPR @Canada Congrats and well deserved! You sooo have bragging rights so no apologies! 😊Taking my dog for a walk and just got called for a foul on Embiid. Coach Nurse is challenging. @Raptors #Raptors #SixersJJ Redick is surprised at how dominant the Philadelphia 76ers have been to begin their playoff series with the Toronto Raptors.  https://t.co/OYy4x25Ts1@JpConsulting4u @Raptors Fred’s knees certainly has some effect on his speed and agility. But Fred’s never been a Speedy Gonzales type. He’s not slow, but Maxey is super fast. I don’t think the strategy is to compete in speed. Need other schemes.@Chase47434045 @Nba_MasDeb8tr @1Dre__P @BAAILEYYCREATES @NBAOfficials @Raptors Awwww  #JoelEmbaby falls down and goes boom cause he doesn’t want to hurt his wittle legs

Some have even pointed out that he eludes VanVleet with his speed 

How much of this @Raptors fans, do you think is ongoing knee soreness that Fred is playing through?

So many haters, eh? @heyhalima 

I don’t get it, tbh

Maybe some Americans are jealous that the @Raptors … the only Canadian NBA team … brought home a Championship?
