The betting line seems to have the Wiz as 3.5 to 4 point favorites. If I was wagering, I'd bet on Washington to cover. Total seems to be about 208. I'd go over on that.The Algo Likes 2 bets today in the NBA.  Take Washington -4 over New Orleans.  It is predicting a double digit victory by the Wizards and a 6 possession difference.  The second bet is Memphis -9.5 over Houston.  It is predicting a 20 point win by MemphisWashington Wizards - New Orleans Pelicans
Over 207.5 points (1.87)
Pinnacle/2 units@IGrillac @Cavsanada Cavs would have defeated Washington Wizards &amp; win against Celtics would have been more decisive if Sexton had played. In those 2 games, there were times when Cavs struggled to score. Sexton was accepting new role before injury &amp; strong in wins over Clippers &amp; Hornets.Whoever got paid to design the Washington Wizards word marks committed a robbery to the highest degree.I asked Coach Willie Greene what he noticed about the Washington Wizards( #DCAboveAll )despite missing key players...

“ Bench, play solid, share the basketball and their defense.”My #NBA Picks For 11/15/21:
