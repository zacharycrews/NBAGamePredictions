#WeTheNorth  #rtz #Raptors https://t.co/slo68SlU5QLately, the Toronto Raptors have been running a lineup of:

PG: Scottie Barnes 
SG: OG Anunoby
SF: Pascal Siakam
PF: Chris Boucher
C: Precious Achiuwa. 

That’s crazy. 6’8 - 6’9 guys who are all athletic and can defend. Haven’t played a lot of minutes but their trying is crazy!@MaryFernando_ @MedicalPost @AngelaMCheung @MoriartyLab @glenpyle Yes, especially given the extraordinarily high numbers of people that have had Omicron. Look at sports teams that do regular testing - on the Toronto Raptors 13 of 14 players (and several coaches) have had Covid in the last month. All are vaxxed, some had Covid last year as well.Hold up, freeze

Raptors -11.5

Could backfire but the Jazz have Gobert &amp; Mitchell out among others and the Raptors are on a tear lately. It’s a lot, especially against a great team but the Jazz are too short handed and I think Toronto blows them out.

Remember when Toronto dealt DeRozan? More than the odd expert said his best days were behind him.

Did the Raptors make a good deal? Absolutely. They won a championship. But that doesn't mean DeRozan was the has-been he was made out to be. https://t.co/MsxSMHfNO2@Digitaldex1 @dark_769_ @Raptors As a raps fan, we do claim him.So excited to watch the SLC Stars take on the Toronto Raptors tonight!@ssaieeda @Raptors @OAnunoby Not all of them, the one about the @ or # is wrong online 😂@princethegoat10 @topofgame1986 @devinballard531 @dark_769_ @TwiTati @Raptors @FredVanVleet Thats the thing, i dont know.

When we didn't have our best players we were slaughtered... Teams were high fiving during our demise before we got our roster back and also when we were Tampa Bay Raptors..

I have been voting for all stars…including OG, on the NBA website.
What does RT do?@JLew1050 A win is a win. Nobody gave a crap about our Raptors when they had to deal with all the extra ordinary circumstances of last year when playing away from Toronto. Now that things are now 180 I don’t give a crap either. Raptors are doing exactly what needs to be done. #wethenorth@Raptors @OAnunoby These tweets stay goated@AitkenCoach @Raptors @FredVanVleet At the end of the day it's a popularity contest, and the NBA is basically American 🤷‍♂️, remember when Shaq didn't know who Pascal was?RT: Raptors: When everyone keeps telling us we're tweeting wrong but you know the NBA wrote the rules wrong on their website...
