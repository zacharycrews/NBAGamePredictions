DO NOT ANSWER UNLESS YOU CAN COME! 

How many 3’s has Bones Hyland made so far in his rookie career? He just broke the Denver Nuggets rookie record passing Jamal Murray.

First person gets two tickets. Good luck!Bol Bol Denver Nuggets 2019 20 P #autographed #ad https://t.co/tZvrZAm1LMWould you rather face the Denver Nuggets (No Jamal Murray or Michael Porter Jr.) or the Minnesota Timberwolves in the playoffs?Fun Fact headed into tonight's game:

Ryan Bowen, an assistant coach for the Denver Nuggets, holds some brief ties with the Oklahoma City Thunder.

Bowen played one game for OKC back in the 2009-2010 season.

He is one of six players to have played just one game for the Thunder.Before it was clear that a rights extension could not be worked out, FSN RM had Kroenke's Denver Nuggets and Colorado Avalanche.INJURY REPORT FOR OKLAHOMA THUNDERS AND DENVER NUGGETS GAME #NBA75 https://t.co/sPXcps6NP8sending the worst possible vibes to the denver nuggetsConsensus Line Move:
