Expecting another quick start with a sense of urgency.

Step 1 of avoiding a 0-2 hole is you can't trail out the gate.

Grizzlies led 1Q, 32-24 in Game 1 and own better playoff 1Q numbers.

In the playoffs, they are shooting the 6th most FTA/g.

I'm sure there are refereeing mistakes involving both Steph and Draymond, but I don't see the ascribed malice.@memgrizz @ilovememphis lets go memphis......Saying that these #MemphisGrizzlies are reminiscent of the 2015 #goldenstatewarriors is utterly ridiculous and laughable. That Warriors team was a historic team that changed the way the game is played with their fast play and incredible shot making that blew teams out regularly.With the Espn ratings for tonight's game they have us the Memphis Grizzlies 68.1% over the Golden State Warriors

Or that the league is secretly plotting against its most popular title-winning dynasty?@KRaynor213 @LockedOnDubs @kevo408 @warriors @memgrizz @OfficialNBARefs @Money23Green Considering they’re the only team to ever have their star player suspended in a championship game/series and it happened AGAIN based on subjective judgments I don’t think I’m out of line bringing up the subject.@Grizz_Fan_Ant @memgrizz Hellyea bro, I know you are PUMPED!

Many other fans get none of that.@nxtprodigy @memgrizz Right like I know it’s a promotional tool to help get fans to the game but they should 1000% put them up for sale2022 NBA Playoffs: Memphis Grizzlies vs. Golden State Warriors Game 2 Preview https://t.co/OqxaIHkJDk@DogSurfRoadshow @LockedOnDubs @kevo408 @warriors @memgrizz @OfficialNBARefs @Money23Green You pointed to Crowders kick, but Draymond has literally done that, too. Like said on the pod, to bring up the NBAs "ruling class" as if the Warriors are not it likely reflects your own biases rather than the league's.@DogSurfRoadshow @LockedOnDubs @kevo408 @warriors @memgrizz @OfficialNBARefs @Money23Green Cyrus, I feel like your own biased are pretty strongly coming through here. In all of instances I've heard you talk about Draymond, you have omitted the violations he HAS made that have earned his reputation, in favor of discussing him being vocal.Am I crazy?  Probably!!!  Making a mad dash with my 20 year old son to Memphis from West Arkansas to watch @StephenCurry30 and the @warriors beat the @memgrizz tonight!!

Can’t wait for him to join this series.@DripTooHardJosh @memgrizz I thought most of his looks were good tbh. He’ll hit them eventually. I can only remember one that was a bad shot.@memgrizz Forum better be jumpin tomorrow night. Sorry I can’t fly out.@dallasmavs and @memgrizz coming out these series.
