Obsessed &amp; Jealous!@Jumpshot8 @undisputed @ShannonSharpe @Suns @Lakers @FirstTake  and that is why no watches ya in the morning, Nick and Shannon about to come out the closet .

I like Shannon and I watch Undisputed religiously, but they could cast a topic list a little wider than Lakers and Cowboys.@Jumpshot8 @undisputed @ShannonSharpe @Suns @Lakers I wish more notable people would speak up about how repetitive the show is. I miss when sports shows were actually good. They literally just make up stuff to have a segment. All day "How will [literally anything] effect LeBron's/Brady's legacy? Next on @undisputed"Anybody remember this guy? @Suns @OU_MBBall #AlvanAdams one of my childhood faves #awesomepasser https://t.co/dVLNIK0lO4@Jumpshot8 @undisputed @ShannonSharpe @Suns @Lakers Unless it's the Cowboys, LeBron, or Brady...it's not being covered. Maybe some Baker Mayfield here and there. It's pathetic. Arguably the biggest game of the year in the Bills and Chiefs, but not one mention. They make sure to have 7 Cowboys segments though.@MShonaBrock @lcrawford38 @Santinobambino3 @Jumpshot8 @undisputed @ShannonSharpe @Suns @Lakers These cats just purely jealous 😆 😂 😂.@lcrawford38 @MShonaBrock @Santinobambino3 @Jumpshot8 @undisputed @ShannonSharpe @Suns @Lakers How is it holding on to showtime?

Guess the answer to each of these questions with a current Phoenix Suns player. No 2-way players or players on 10-days were included.@23_lbj23 @trader04 @Jumpshot8 @undisputed @ShannonSharpe @Suns @Lakers In the last four years that roster has been completely different. Even after winning it all you guys decided that wasn't good enough. Now it's a aging roster with a 37 yr old.  Bron great but he's stuck on winning 4 titles@Jumpshot8 @undisputed @ShannonSharpe @Suns @Lakers I’m beginning to dislike the show also@Jumpshot8 @undisputed @ShannonSharpe @Suns @Lakers SHANNON DULL DON'T KNOW NOTHING ABOUT BASKETBALL.

What a way to celebrate a win😍🏀💕@OldenPolynice1 @Jumpshot8 @undisputed @ShannonSharpe @Suns @Lakers I agree. I’m so tired of listening to Laker talk. I get he loves The Lakers but what about those Suns, Warriors,Grizzlies and Jazz?@OldenPolynice1 @Jumpshot8 @undisputed @ShannonSharpe @Suns @Lakers So you really said thrash instead of trash? Not one, not two, but three times? 😂😭😂@Jumpshot8 @undisputed @ShannonSharpe @Suns @Lakers Some folks don’t understand marketability. Its true. A lot of the show revolves around the biggest sports brands. Theres a difference between an institution and a flash in the pan. The Suns are the flash. Maybe one day they can become the institution the Lakers and Cowboys are.@d_master888 @Tracy3579 @Jumpshot8 @ShannonSharpe @SiriusXMNBA @Suns Lakers salary is a lot larger than the Suns so you can forget me with that@Jumpshot8 @undisputed @ShannonSharpe @Suns @Lakers Best believe Russ gets down on himself, especially when everyone blames him for everything that goes wrong with the team he grew up rooting for. If you believe otherwise, you must not think the man is human.@Jumpshot8 @undisputed @ShannonSharpe @Suns @Lakers esp a highly competitive athlete who put the work in to be the best he can be at his craft. No one wants to be the butt of jokes/ridicule of the entire world, daily bloopers perpetuated by your man skeeup, which of course you endorse. Personally, I think you speak on emotion.@Jumpshot8 @undisputed @ShannonSharpe @Suns @Lakers You keep agreeing with Skip that Russ doesn't give a damn about winning and losing and that he sleeps good at night with 9 turnovers and his team losing, as long as he gets his triple dub. Well, in case you forgot Shannon, no one wants to feel like a failure in life...#DYK 

In 1997, Horacio Llamas became the first Mexican to participate in a @NBA 🏀game? 

He played for the @Suns between 1997 and 1998. Llamas had an important impact in the city, primarily with the Hispanic community who became interested in basketball.

#MexicansInArizona https://t.co/ZquCxlSeEM@Jumpshot8 @undisputed @ShannonSharpe @Suns @Lakers Thank you sir!!!! Finally someone speaking up and saying what needs to be said!!

Russ &amp; AD are media scapegoats...🤦🏾‍♂️Phoenix #Suns backup center Bismack Biyombo told

https://t.co/E27oPtfD2s@Jumpshot8 @undisputed @ShannonSharpe @Suns @Lakers I know you love Skeeup, but damn, you feel indebted to him, no doubt, but it's becoming way too obvious and, in my opinion, is diminishing the entertainment value.@Jumpshot8 @undisputed @ShannonSharpe @Suns @Lakers Imagine your Skip agreeing, saying you're right Shannon, this is on Tom Brady, or it's Baker Mayfield's fault, or Tim Tebow should be held accountable for not being as good as I made him out to be. Not happening. Skip's his own man; he kisses the ass of no one.@Jumpshot8 @undisputed @ShannonSharpe @Suns @Lakers when they mentioned Russ didn't speak to the media, you did not have the same energy. In my opinion, this show is turning into "you're right Skeeup" on any Lebron-hating topic, telling Skippy Skip what he wants to hear. You're right skeeup!!! HEHEHE, girly giggles.@Jumpshot8 @undisputed @ShannonSharpe @Suns @Lakers even going as far as agreeing with Skeeup that Lebron is to blame for everything. You even criticized Lebron the other day, agreeing with Skip (as is becoming typical), for not talking to the media. You also criticized him for leaving the bench early, but a couple days ago...@statmuse @Suns @CP3 @DevinBook @Dujet59 best back court in the nba@Jumpshot8 @undisputed @ShannonSharpe @Suns @Lakers No offense Shannon, got nuttin but love for you brutha, but I somewhat agree with Eddie on this 1.

After a 5-0 road-trip, Suns are back home. They are set to take on the Indiana Pacers, who’s last two games are wins against the Lakers AND Warriors. Not happening here 😤 https://t.co/QGoLRu7Hub@Jumpshot8 @undisputed @ShannonSharpe @Suns @Lakers I have to agree. There's a whole slate of NFL games this weekend and they spent so much time discussing Cowboys, Lakers, Dak, Westbrick ..... 

I'm like bruhhhhhh 🤣You spelled Phoenix Suns wrong. https://t.co/qzzcEhFiY8@futurewardino @Suns Maybe it's his personality but it can't be the age.January 22, 1993: Richard Dumas of Phoenix dunks on Washington's Pervis Ellison.

Dumas scored a team-high 26 PTS. Ellison scored a game-high 27 PTS.

He played 261 games in his career for the Suns.@addefalco Phoenix Suns: ESPN’s worst nightmare@tryin2makeit2 Yeah that's the one. I'm familiar with the area. I worked for a company called maintenance Mart in Phoenix doing their installs for D backs and Suns facilities. It was pretty cool job going in the locker rooms and floor section with no one in it. Saw Nash one time so that was fun@Goodguy430 @Jumpshot8 @undisputed @ShannonSharpe @Suns @Lakers Is your remote broken ???@Jumpshot8 @ShannonSharpe @SiriusXMNBA @Suns That's right Eddie Tell Shannon put some damn respect on our name.  Concoxes that LAL put together as a team. Smdh@Jumpshot8 @undisputed @ShannonSharpe @Suns @Lakers Cowboys, Lakers usually make up 2/3hrs. Show is fun but it is repetitive for sure.This just in:   Phoenix Suns with a 4 game lead over the Warriors...now back to our regularly scheduled chat... #HealthyFaithChat@Jumpshot8 @ShannonSharpe @SiriusXMNBA @Suns Undisputed is debate between two fans who one just so happens to be a retired hall of fame NFL player and the other a nationally known journalist.

That is all they talk about. Throw in occasional talk on MJ. I like the show, but I watch it less and less, because it’s too repetitive on Cowboys, TB and Lebron. There is more to talk about in sports.@Jumpshot8 @toddthegodd5 @undisputed @ShannonSharpe @Suns @Lakers That’s u though lol@greghemphill96 Here in Phoenix, AZ it has been Hot and Sunny.

My beautiful Blue Phoenix. 🥺🥺 And now, in 2022, his World Tour is about to FINALLY start, i'm so excited for him 💙 https://t.co/STfaiAIi4c@suns_tutu_fan @Suns I totally agree! When I buy new Suns gear I directly to the Suns shop downtown or to another site.@m_crouton Sending you some sun from Phoenix, Arizona 🥰😘 https://t.co/NZvtLketCG@Jumpshot8 @undisputed @ShannonSharpe @Suns @Lakers Sharpe was right you just can’t take being called out. Also, the Suns are not the best team in basketball having the best record by a few games at the All-Star break means nothing. They have been lucky with Covid and injuries and that’ll leave it out you’ll see. #StoopThereItIs@ThaKingOfKings @Jumpshot8 @undisputed @ShannonSharpe @Suns @Lakers The fact that u asked that shows ur missing the entire point of Eddie's tweet. But out of the 6 playoff games that were scheduled that weekend they focused on 2 of them the whole week Cowboys vs Niners and Eagles vs Bucs. It's like the other 4 games weren't happening.@RobParkerFS1 

Restating the obvious, Ja Morant is currently the most exciting player in the NBA and "must see" TV

If Morant, Jaren Jackson Jr and the rest of the Grizzlies stay relatively healthy, they will beat the Phoenix Suns and Golden State Warriors to get to the Finals https://t.co/uZwn0kbG04@Suns Steve Nash baby#14@Jsmiffandwesson @MShonaBrock @Santinobambino3 @Jumpshot8 @undisputed @ShannonSharpe @Suns @Lakers How the Lakers interesting? What makes them different?@raygriffin3000 @Jumpshot8 @undisputed @ShannonSharpe @Suns @Lakers I guess if you talking about something enough, it will move the needle. At this point they have made Lakers polarizing as hell. Not interesting about the Lakers from any other team. Overexposure is never good for anyone or anything. The media makes and breaks ppl and orgs.January 22, 1978: Ron Lee and rookie Alvin Scott of Phoenix help extend the Suns’ lead over the Bullets.

Phoenix won, 114-101, led by Paul Westphal (30 PTS) and rookie Walter Davis (22 PTS). Elvin Hayes had 26 PTS &amp; 19 REB for Washington.

#NBA #NBA75 #phoenix #sunsYesterday, Phoenix Suns head coach Monty Williams said after a question from @IONIKOS1972, @SdnaGr about Giannis #Antetokounmpo: "He is a former MVP. He has done everything there is to do. He is arguably the best player in the NBA.

Lebron is lebron@bbays32 @Suns @CP3 @fourpeaksbrew Certified Valley Boy@amort9924 @Suns @CP3 @fourpeaksbrew love to see this and we love CP3 in the valley@pugbuh @robsWRLDD @WisconsinSport6 @statmuse @Suns @CP3 @DevinBook Losing close games on the road, and one at home to the best player in the world with a mostly inexperienced playoff is choking?@Jumpshot8 @ShannonSharpe @SiriusXMNBA @Suns Bucks just won a ship and after the first two days everyone forgets thatHave a great weekend!

@Jumpshot8 https://t.co/LW2rFrTJsc@Jumpshot8 @ShannonSharpe @SiriusXMNBA @Suns Eddie, Bucks are the current champions and they don’t even talk about them. It’s entertainment and Suns have no drama right now, so 🤷🏽‍♂️.@dom_jrm @JoshRitter13 @Jumpshot8 @undisputed @ShannonSharpe @Suns @Lakers Nobody wants to hear about the losing ass bum ass lakers@MegaRan @Suns @FootprintCNTR Bag of Tix Ran.... @BagOfTricksCat 😭@HOFDifficult @wontbefined @Jumpshot8 @ShannonSharpe @SiriusXMNBA @Suns Please compare the missed games to the missed games of lebron ad and tht nunn pleaseeee@throwa1017 @statmuse @Suns @CP3 @DevinBook Choking in the playoffs is making the finals after missing the playoffs for 11+ years?

They haven’t talked about any playoff game except for packers and bucs. And Tom Brady, and Dak@WheresTheBall97 @ThomasHoops87 @LoudmouthDray @statmuse @Suns @CP3 @DevinBook Ahhh. Clearly a casual seeing as though you aren't aware the Suns were severely short handed during that finals series@WheresTheBall97 @ThomasHoops87 @LoudmouthDray @statmuse @Suns @CP3 @DevinBook Suns got destroyed by y'all on the second night of a back to back. Need I remind you what happened to the Warriors when they played on the second night of a back to back?@d_master888 @Jumpshot8 @ShannonSharpe @SiriusXMNBA @Suns You’re a casual lmao. Kaminsky, saric, ayton, javale, cam Johnson, cam Payne, devin booker, Jae crowder, shamet, and jalen smith have all missed games this year@steph_burner @statmuse @Suns @CP3 @DevinBook Seeing as tho you're a casual i'll give you a pass. But cp3 tore ligaments in both wrists and Booker strained his hamstringGreat win for former @suns @CoachDManning and the #Terps!

#NCAAB https://t.co/y2g84ABnXyWhy are they called the Phoenix Suns? There’s only 1 Sun@Jumpshot8 @undisputed @ShannonSharpe @Suns @Lakers This may not be the case for @undisputed, but im almost positive ESPN has contractual obligations to mention the Lakers (and other teams and individuals) in shows
