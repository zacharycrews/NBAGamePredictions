Raptors at Knicks - who you trusting with your money? ü§ëü§ëNew York Knicks played the first ever official NBA game.

Yet still suck üòÇüòÇüòÇOn his radio show, Travis Steele says Zach Freemantle had surgery in New York (the Knicks doctor) the day before Media Day. Timeline from that was six weeks, but with foot injuries it's tricky to predict.Hasn‚Äôt been a New York Knicks team that is so well disciplined and balanced in a long time. Super exciting time to be a Knicks fan. Raptors tonight, expecting a comfortable win as long as we can maintain Scotty Barnes. #knicks #knickstapeThe first #NBA game occurred on this date 75 years ago ‚Äî and, believe it or not, it occurred at Maple Leaf Gardens! The #TorontoHuskies, around for just that first season in 1946, hosted the New York Knicks, who edged out a 68-66 win. #WeTheNorth #NBA75 https://t.co/nMb4QwQDhkPumped for this Raptors vs Knicks game.
