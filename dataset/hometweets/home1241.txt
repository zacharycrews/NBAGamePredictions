Nets have struggled with consistency for 48 min since return of KD/Kyrie. They lack versatile wings and will need lights out shooting from Mills or Curry against a defense who has been preparing for a week. Tall task.

It was a pop up for his 7uice brand but they had barely announced the pop up on Friday lolTo start, the Boston Celtics are 4.5 point favorites in gm 1, and small favorites for the series overall. By the numbers, it seems like the books are going to favor the home team in each game, and expect the series to go the full 7 games, with Boston hosting a (potential) gm 7...Breaking down one of the most anticipated first round matchups in awhile, between the Brooklyn #Nets #NetsWorld and the Boston #Celtics .

Robert Williams (left knee meniscal tear) - OUT@MadeBySil @jaytatum0 @celtics Texture! 👌#Boston putting on a show this weekend. The world famous @bostonmarathon Monday, RedSox opening weekend 4 games, @celtics playoff game, @NHLBruins game clinching playoffs. And it all works b/c of @MBTA 🚌🚊 moving the crowds. #transit #BostonMarathon https://t.co/i9EOV0NuwJ@kirkgoldsberry @celtics @memgrizz @Raptors @Suns @BrooklynNets @chicagobulls @nuggets @warriors unfortunately this changes because of the Robert Williams injury. Celtics have a fight on their hands with the Nets.@Rinatin86 @APE_Films @BleacherReport NBA's own website:
"Because his career paralleled the succession of juggernaut Boston Celtics teams in the 1950s and 1960s, Baylor never played on a club that won an NBA Championship."

The Suns are likely to come out from the West. I think Dray is back from injury so lets not rule out Warriors first. If Dray is around, Steph in his element then they're a force even of Klay is 20 percent.@THEBASTARDJUDAS @celtics Cuz Kyrie and Kd finna cook y’all sorry assJust seen somebody legitimately pick the Boston Celtics To win the NBA finals@celtics I’ve been waiting to bust this out: https://t.co/CdRDDCXRVHOne more day for the playoffs to begin! @celtics How you like me now? https://t.co/MRpPk0p6pUBoston Celtics Daily Links 4/16/22

The Celtics have been strong since the start of 2022. But both Kevin Durant &amp; Kyrie Irving are too dominant to stop. Nets win the series in 6 games. #NBAPlayoffs https://t.co/0NFLmNntuw@PhillipJerez @MiamiHEAT @celtics @Suns @warriors I also had Heat v Suns in 7 👀@BDMMA3 Boston CelticsBoston Celtics vs Phoenix suns @Kaionda23 @Kaionda @JpMighty5 #NBATopShotThis ts is DodgyTeddy 🔥💪🔥 https://t.co/8Ud5jtlirwThe Boston Celtics need to move forward too, as well as their upset fans https://t.co/efXtHUjQKBYou wanted Boston?

I think the pelicans sneakily get 2. Suns in 6…
