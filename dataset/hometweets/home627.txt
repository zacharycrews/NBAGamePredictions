#HEATUPMiami Heat -2.5 1st half (-105 on FD) 

This is mainly a fade of a Hawk’s team decimated with injuries and bad vibes right now. Lack of effort and poor defensive efficiency. The Heat are also rolling right now and should cover this easily.

#gamblingtwitter #nbatwitter #freepicks https://t.co/VKQ9fM8gooWhen matched against Caleb Martin, Young failed to score (0 for 4 from the field). No Clint Capela today with the potential that Jimmy Butler returns suggests this game looks cherry ripe for another Miami Heat B2B win.MULTI LEG #1 of 2

The Atlanta Hawks heavily rely on star player Trae Young but his stats reflect a recent struggle against the Miami Heat. Last 3 games he’s scored 15, 18, 15 points.

How does a super team have a losing record without their best player
But the Bulls could damn near win 60 games without theirs?@MiamiHEAT why do you guys make us pay absurds amount of money to watch our beloved team on TV. ATT and Comcast are the only places to get bally and they are highway robbery. Why cant you look iut for your fans and get @ballysports on YoutubeTv and Hululive?Host on NBA Today admitted they don't talk much about @MiamiHEAT despite them sitting in the #2 spot in the East smh.I will said LeBron James was better with The Cleveland Cavaliers than he was with The Miami Heat and The Los Angeles Lakers cause LeBron James meant so much for The City of Cleveland and LeBron should retire in Cleveland.

PTS/G 19.2

Bosh complemented both players very well with his ability to stretch the floor and leadership in the locker room. What I enjoyed most about Bosh was his calming presence in games. #MiamiHeat#7 Glen Rice
PTS/G 18.3
REB/G 3.4
Glen Rice was the star of the Miami Heat. During his time with the Heat in the early 90s, Glen Rice was a star, consistently scoring 18+ points per game while shooting over 45% from the field and 39% from the three-point line. #MiamiHeatAfter 2 long weeks the Miami Heat are back home and looking to extend their winstreak to 4 tonight https://t.co/ZnaRV9Lje0#8 Udonis Haslem

Udonis Haslem is a Heat-lifer. Everyone loves an origin story and his gets no better. From the tough streets of Miami to going undrafted, to working his way into the NBA, Haslem embodies the spirit of the “Heat Way”.  #MiamiHeatMy team is 2nd in the East!🔥 @MiamiHEAT

How much be your sub again???

Qatar 10 years deal, Silverstone deal, Monza, Miami and the likes  are the type of deal that can be canceled for F1 to truly feel some heatI'm not on team trade Duncan, but...

Norm Powell/ Gary Trent jr would look great in the sg position. (GTJ is  unlikely to be traded) Norm is a very efficient 18ppg scorer who has played with Kyle.

But I still like Duncan for us.
