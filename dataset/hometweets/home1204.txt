A win over Brooklyn + Hawks loss puts us up 2 games over both Nets and Hawks no? https://t.co/TFZr2xuqE1Maybe they throw Atlanta a bone to worsen the chances of the Brooklyn Nets being their opponent in the first round? I don’t think they’d want to see Brooklyn or Atlanta in the first round IMO…tip-off is at 8pm eastern from Miami! #TrueToAtlanta

Lol that's hilarious, how epic would it be if the Nets take out the bucks. With the time lord I think we can beat the heat, but the only team I'd worry about is 76ers.All this talk about Milwaukee or Boston playing Brooklyn in the 1st round of the playoffs and I'm like "Why aren't we hoping the Nets lose their next two games and are forced to try and win two play-in games to even make the playoffs?" 😂If the Bucks get the 2 seed, face Brooklyn as the 7 seed, and then lose 4 of 7 games? Okay. So be it. The nets were better. But avoiding any team in specific feels like you’ve already lost.A possible play-in preview between the @cavs and @BrooklynNets tomorrow on @TV5manila.If the Hawks win tomorrow, they’ll be no worse than 8th going into the final game.

They scared. We're not #NetsWorld@BrooklynNets @IamJJ16 nash next@joetsai1999 @KDTrey5 @BrooklynNets so what? Have defense at center n 3 lines? Nash only focus on offense. This's why he often use 3/4 shorts, lack of 3 defense. Droumond is slow, I don't understand why you cannot keep Sharpe  Edwards 20 minutes. Clark cannot def and get rebs facing East Strong Center guy🍩 #SportAZBiteSized: If you haven't heard of @Fanatics yet, expect to for the next while.

For Nash who only pays attention to Offense. Mills might be used more without defense at all instead Edwards. This is why Nets doesn't have center and 3 defense at allWith the Bucks’ win tonight, if the Nets secure #7, it looks like we’ll be getting a Brooklyn-Milwaukee rematch in the first round.

Super tough draw for both teams so early in the playoffs. The Nets might need Ben Simmons in some capacity to pull it out.Milwaukee Bucks are not afraid of the Brooklyn Nets. They have went out and tried to actively get the 2nd seed.James Harden is washed up Kyrie was not wrong one bit.  @BrooklynNets won that tradeWE WANT THE @BrooklynNets IN THE FIRST ROUND!

Yea knicks had the Clay's shut dwn for a long time.  But not any more BROOKLYN BRIGADE STAND UPSo, let me get this straight...

The Bucks starters struggle to win vs the Celtics bench and probably get the dreaded 2 seed (that nobody wants) and the Brooklyn Nets match-up and Bucks fans are happy with that?!?!@ItsPoptartjoker @FANATICALLYSICK @Kevthkid @BrooklynNets @IamJJ16 It is natural cause Clark plays 4.

LeBron now 30.268 ppg vs Joel at 30.424 ppg.  If Joel scores only 30 pts in final 3 games, James would have to avg 34.25 ppg to catch Embiid.@RaymondBink2010 A 25 year old with a 55 year old back, already missed 2 out of his first 6 szns, can't shoot, can't get on the floor, quit on his old team, tryna collect $ off his old team, Nets take him in as damage goods and after the all initial hype idc if he ever plays for the Brooklyn Nets@BrooklynNets @IamJJ16 thank God@BrooklynNets Why is this filmed in 28 Days Later mode?@jordancornette Hell nah not after calling Joe Harris the @BrooklynNets best defender 😂😂😂😂Call me a coward but we I’ve got no problem dropping to third to avoid Brooklyn. We realistically lose to Bucks or Nets but I like our odds better against the bucks.  #BOSvsMIL@BrooklynNets @IamJJ16 Next one will be Nash, hopefully.@TheJoeFerro @BrooklynNets @IamJJ16 During that time, KD was injured, Kyrie was not in, harden went to 76, and James Johnson was a point guard for some time. Did you forget it@MorrisChestbutt @RxoUbaid @BrooklynNets @IamJJ16 @KDTrey5 Should’ve never let JKidd leave.@MorrisChestbutt @RxoUbaid @BrooklynNets @IamJJ16 @KDTrey5 That’s both true at all. We played young guys in the bubble and win a series and surprised ppl.@MorrisChestbutt @RxoUbaid @BrooklynNets @IamJJ16 @KDTrey5 Harden always flops. It failed big time .@BrooklynNets He just like me Fr@MorrisChestbutt @RxoUbaid @BrooklynNets @IamJJ16 @KDTrey5 It doesn’t work like that,@MorrisChestbutt @RxoUbaid @BrooklynNets @IamJJ16 @KDTrey5 When u wish upon a star. Both he and Kyrie are head cases@MorrisChestbutt @RxoUbaid @BrooklynNets @IamJJ16 @KDTrey5 Wrong!@MorrisChestbutt @RxoUbaid @BrooklynNets @IamJJ16 @KDTrey5 The Warriors missed Kalyan, Stephen and Draymond for long periods of time.The Bridge Episode 6 | All-Access with the Brooklyn Nets https://t.co/bfDESKzIOc via @YouTubeBrooklyn Nets* https://t.co/JOwF7i2n6S@celticsforum I’m glad we rested Tatum and Al. I don’t wanna face the nets round 1 no matter what. I’d rather face Toronto/Chicago and then bucks or Brooklyn when rob is back.If Milwaukee can hang on 2 seed becomes pretty likely...if Brooklyn can stay in 7-8 matchup might be looking @ a Bucks-Nets 1st round series@Kevthkid @RxoUbaid @BrooklynNets @IamJJ16 @KDTrey5 And not to mention giving up Levert saved his life, probably would have ended his career or life early without that trade@Kevthkid @RxoUbaid @BrooklynNets @IamJJ16 @KDTrey5 And the Grizzlies are literally the only team with a winning record without their star player. Nets, Lakers, Nuggets, 76ERS, Clippers etc all have losing records without their star player.well the bucks r winning 😁 prayers up for the @BrooklynNets https://t.co/jRUrhOl0Gl@Kevthkid @RxoUbaid @BrooklynNets @IamJJ16 @KDTrey5 Simmons who when healthy is arguably the best wing defender and a top 8 facilitator, Curry one of the best shooters in the game, Drummond the best rebounder in the league and 2 1st round picks.

 #Brooklyn_Nets@BrooklynNets That KD got on Twitter after the game lmao@Kevthkid @RxoUbaid @BrooklynNets @IamJJ16 @KDTrey5 Turned all of them pretty much into KD, Kyrie and Harden. Back when we had no future, no Nets fan could have seen this coming. Marks has been a blessing to the organization. Did Harden flop? Not really, just didn’t work out with injuries last season and he turned him into…2012-13 Panini Kyrie Irving Rookie Lot x2 #227 RC Brooklyn Nets Duke Basketball - https://t.co/YlIhGW5TtN

IMHO his role was never very well defined….@susan1234456789 @BrooklynNets LeBaby and the nursing home🖕🏼@BrooklynNets KD post game https://t.co/AGIu20Cx5K@brooklynnets85 Gotta break it to ya, most of the hardcore Nets fan are from New Jersey. And the trek from NJ to Brooklyn 42 times  a season probably won’t happen.

Don’t want to see Brooklyn stuff post a pic in NJ nets game no throws back don’t count.@Kevthkid @ItsPoptartjoker @BrooklynNets @IamJJ16 Claxton has great energy and athleticism, but he's not our best strength interior player. That's his problem. He'll get bullied by Giannis. That's where Aldridge and Drummond would be better. They should use Claxton only in certain spots for certain roles.@KnicksNationCP Don't care. Soooo glad they went Brooklyn. Ones always injured and the others a head case. For all the money they command Nets ain't winnin nothin #DodgedaBullet@BrooklynNets I must say if the Brooklyn Nets put it together and LaMarcus Aldridge get his game right the nets will be a problem in the east@KyrieIrving; @KDTrey5; @BrooklynNets
