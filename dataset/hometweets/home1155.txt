I think there were 14 games in March and they went 11-3.

Incredible run against brutal stretch of top teams.  Almost makes you think there should be a strength of schedule "cap" per two weeks.

Sounds like Giannis did the same to some grown men!@eddstaa @NBA @Bucks @Giannis_An34 Giannis doesn't flop he's just too good

Plus teams foul him more often cause of his free throw percentage, smarter to make him earn it than let him get a free dunk so it makes sense strategically

Harden just flops and Embiid is like 50/50#FearTheDeer BUCK'S WIN

Slim Reaper vs The Greek freak@Bucks Our offense revolves around Middleton almost as much as it does with Giannis. Some of those OT possessions were rough lol. Fun game though.@Bucks Lucky win + no Ben Simmons@JorFailure_ @Bucks Dunno why he'd play down that far.Giannis is the greatest Milwaukee Buck of all time.@Bucks I’m exhausted…..#FearTheDeer@apimpnamestpbak @BehemothBaller @NBA @Bucks @BrooklynNets Should have been a flagrant on matthews and before giannis was "hacked" did he not get clax in the face?@Bucks all that to loose in the first round 😭I watched Michael Jordan and now Giannis. I can’t tell much of a difference when it comes to clutch, the will to win, and greatness. MVP 
Milwaukee Bucks now the clear favorite in the East, but I still believe Phoenix and Memphis are currently better. What does @RealSkipBayless@LILUZIVERT16002 @Bucks Bro… literally, the ball is halfway to the hoop and I’m like “well at least we came back and made it competitive” 😂🤦🏻‍♂️@QRoyalty91 @Bucks @BrooklynNets I’m glad the Bucks won tonight.

Last year kyrie this year Bruce Brown….@tpb_ms @808Dev_ @Bucks @PicknSaveStores @Giannis_An34 Nothing about what Middleton did was common, he didnt even jump@Bucks @PicknSaveStores @Giannis_An34 tell wanna be Michael Redd to calm down@NBA your refs just ruined the @Bucks and @BrooklynNets game. Yes it was a hard foul, yes it was a flagrant 1, but he was not trying to hurt him and it was plain to see for anyone that ever picked up a bball. Get your refs to watch some lakers and Celtics 80s games for practice!@JakkMane @Bucks @PicknSaveStores @Giannis_An34 Jag off https://t.co/1dQZwIaiMI@baller_alert15 @Bucks Down 9 lmaoooooo@cmpsu_ @Bucks RatioAbsolutely bonkers officiating in the @Bucks game. So many missed out of bounds calls. Terrible flagrant 2 call. Tons of no calls on jump shots. Just weird.@Bucks @PicknSaveStores @Giannis_An34 Bucks might have won the Championship but Charles Barkley might be right about how dumb they play sometimes ... Who would not have taught Carter would be motivated to win against his former team ? Only Coach Bud@OfficialNBARefs @Bucks @BrooklynNets @NBAonTNT Guantanamo for this crew.

See everyone in the playoffs🦌 https://t.co/RlboD20jrL@Bucks @BrooklynNets @NBA That was NOT a flagrant 2 foul by Kris Middleton on Brown!NBA loves penalizing the Bucks cause they can’t stand they didn’t leave MilwaukeeNIGGA GET TF OUT OF HERE @BucksBruce Brown added to our h!t list @bucks@Bucks @PicknSaveStores @Giannis_An34 trade Middleton and fire bud@OfficialNBARefs @Bucks @BrooklynNets @NBAonTNT All I see is a trio of idiots. None of them should ever ref a game again.Refs love to eject Bucks players when possible. It’s always Milwaukee vs Everybody. Brown slowed down the whole way, Middleton caught him, never hooked him, Brown fell hard. Tough play. But went for the ball. Consistent anti-Bucks call that they don’t call against any other team.So i get the Milwaukee Bucks strategy against the Nets, try to injure their players!!! Weak as fuck!!!!
#Bucks #NetsBucks got hosed by refs, missed 25 3’s and still almost won.

Should’ve been a common foul or at max a flagrant 1, not an ejection!

@Bucks still winning this game though…Think that probably ends the Bucks chances tonight. Milwaukee just doesn't have the shot creation to outscore KD and Kyrie now.@NBAonTNT what a fucking joke. @Bucks NBA is soft as fuck. The whole reason that happened was Brown had a stick up his ass and Loli gagged in beginning of play. Good hustle Kris.

Milwaukee played the Hawks in the ECF last season. Played Brooklyn in the conference semis.

Nets have to beat bucks in milwaukee this year. We get the home court in playoffs this year@Bucks @PicknSaveStores @Giannis_An34 Giannis need some help out thereIntellectual conversation on the Bucks Radio Network as @Davekoehnpxp invokes the Pythagorean theorem. However, Milwaukee cannot locate the hypotenuse right now as the Nets lead the Bucks 99-96 with 5:24 left. Irving has 23 for the Nets. 37/10/4 on 13-18 for AntetokounmpoHow has no one corrected the @NBAonTNT announcers yet? The @bucks didn’t play the @nets in the ECF last year. They played the @ATLHawks in the ECF and left #bkn in the second round where they belong. #MILvsBKN@Kedalove1 @NBA @NBAonTNT @BR_NBA @Bucks They even lying on the play by play. You clearly see on my video. He makes one free throw and the ball goes back to the nets.

The disparity is not even close.Milwaukee tied its biggest lead of the game of 4 points up 96-92, but a Seth Curry 3-pointer brings the Nets within 1.

Bucks up 96-95, 6:46 remaining@dkrause203 @Bucks Imagine what the score would be if they cut that down by even 50%...win or lose this game, no one can compete with this team when they are fully focusedHoly fuck giannis pass the ball your not the point guard.

Kyrie Irving (20 PTS), Bruce Brown (17 PTS) &amp; the Nets are losing the battle on the boards 29-38. Fortunately, they’re putting on a show from behind the arc, shooting it at 54%.

Don't have to wonder now@Ndabzz23 @Bucks Since Ibaka hosted Liz Cambage on his show, Bud has been acting very strange. Does he have a crush on Liz?@piipsii_ i don’t think he wins another title with the current landscape in the east unless milwaukee seriously blows it up within the next year. the pillars of the bucks are all in their prime, and still no match for brooklyn in a series. 76ers, Celtics, Heat, &amp; Bulls are all 50/50@Bucks Coach bud during his timeouts https://t.co/tbAXpHS59zLet’s go @Bucks 🦌🦌🦌🦌Can’t imagine being the @Bucks and paying Brook Lopez’ big ass to essentially not do anything.

Get this man some help. Get Jevon Carter on the floor.. stop the solidarity mins given to players that are not playing well. He can only carry so much@SnellSZN @Bucks My guess as to why Jevon and Serge aren't in is that Bud is likely testing the main lineups he's going to use in the playoffs with no real risk as its a regular ssn gm. In all honesty, its unlikely Serge/Jevon are going to get anything more than special case mins in the offs imho@Bucks Yal gonna lose if holiday keeps this shit upBucks can't stop the nets
Nets can't stop the bucks

The difference? Milwaukee is out hustling the nets on both ends. Bucks down 80-76 but we should pull out a close one.@Bucks better play closer up to Kylie. The men is a beast.
