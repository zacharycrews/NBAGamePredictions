I saw Bird live more than you saw him on TV, kiddo.All this hype about the @celtics for what? They’re in the East and they’re going to lose to the @warriors in 6 regardless.

It can be a sweep. But I think your bucks will steal one. I also think they'll have a better shot at stealing that one in Boston. If not, it will be Game 3. If not, they may get swept.

I’d say yes someone could but Celtics defense is too badass. It just not probable.@CSource97 @xmariomc @CyrexPlex @HaakonMusic @ThereGoBrandon @celtics I'm telling you right now...you do not know this Celtics team. Your comments reflect that. You will see in 12 hours &amp; some change, bub. I do a watch party on my Twitch. Now I'm muting this convo. We'll revisit later. We both agree 5 games max though. So there's that!
#Bleedgreen@STR8Homah @CyrexPlex @CSource97 @HaakonMusic @ThereGoBrandon @celtics Lol sorry wrong again our company @XSPAPP that I’m with have many clients we make money for daily. Now again I think the Bucks have the best player and a proven team they have lost an all star player so that does make a difference it’s not an excuse I still like the Champs 🤷🏻‍♂️@CSource97 @xmariomc @CyrexPlex @HaakonMusic @ThereGoBrandon @celtics Are you really calling me a bandwagon? THAT sir...is hilarious. Playoffs &amp; Regular Season are different only in intensity. The basics are exactly the same.

There is no real difference.@CSource97 @STR8Homah @xmariomc @ThereGoBrandon @HaakonMusic @celtics Haha dude you can’t sniff out a good troll tweet from a quality tweet.

You think he doesn’t watch basketball? So he doesn’t know@his competition? Lol this shows you know nothing about Giannis.

The Nets were SWEPT in the playoff in 2020

And they were just SWEPT against

Boston Celtics head coach just ran circle around Steve Nash

So what would be different next year 

Common Sense say that the Nets need a new head coach@CyrexPlex @xmariomc @CSource97 @HaakonMusic @ThereGoBrandon @celtics Thing is...They aren't looking at numbers either. They're just "wE aRe 2021 cHaMpS. WiLl wIn" homers.@threevincenzo @kirkgoldsberry @Bucks @dallasmavs @MiamiHEAT @celtics @Suns @warriors @memgrizz @chicagobulls @nuggets Ah. That makes sense.HAPPY BOSTON CELTICS GAMEDAYYYYY@CyrexPlex @xmariomc @CSource97 @HaakonMusic @ThereGoBrandon @celtics That's not true. Numbers do matter. No way Nets should have won on any paper. They had 2 guys &amp; a bunch of minor role players that step up every 4 or 5 games. From Jan to April Celtics were #2 O(suns) #1 D. #1 pt diff. Best on the road in damn near every stat &amp; blowing teams out.🗣️ Marc D'Amico make a bold comparison between Clippers duo of PG13 - Kawhi and Celtics duo of Brown - Tatum! 

Which is the better duo?

Setting up your excuses. Remember...you said all of this already knowing there was no Middleton for this series. I think you like to play a handicapper on the internet honestly. Because you just sound like a homer that knows nothing at all about the Celtics.@CSource97 @STR8Homah @xmariomc @ThereGoBrandon @HaakonMusic @celtics Ok bud https://t.co/einYzReqbJ@STR8Homah @CyrexPlex @xmariomc @ThereGoBrandon @HaakonMusic @celtics Ofcourse I’ll say you’re right lol.

Or will thou flee &amp; become Heat fans all of sudden?

And they took no prisoners. In Denver the crowd was chanting MVP when Tatum went to the line. 2021 MVP Jokic was playing in that game, btw. Celtics blew them out on their court. This is their announcers in this clip!
https://t.co/SMMAmGm06oThis not even the biggest finesse in @celtics history. Red Auerbach traded the @warriors his 1st round pick in the draft for their 3rd overall pick and Robert Parish.

This is not last seasons Celtics. This isn't even Oct-Nov 2021's Celtics! Look at the roster at the start of the season. We were 16-19...then our starters were all back &amp; we took our final form for 2022.

Not in 2022.@CSource97 @CyrexPlex @xmariomc @ThereGoBrandon @HaakonMusic @celtics If you don't see the diff between 2021 Celtics &amp; 2022 Celtics..You don't know ball besides your own team.
I rep all my home teams...hence, str8 homah...but I pay attention to all teams.
You sound like you know your team and rely on sports analysts for other teams.

If we had Brad Steven’s as coach and didn’t improve the lineup then I’d agree. But a NEW coach has made this team lethal, he isn’t correcting mistakes of past seasons this is his starting point. 2021 is another world.@STR8Homah @CSource97 @CyrexPlex @ThereGoBrandon @HaakonMusic @celtics Games like that mean nothing happens a lot close games with guys missing cause the other teams let down especially in regular season games. figure it’s a walk over than the backups play hard and they pull out close wins that’s the NBA all the time it has zero bearing on anythingThe only team to register a first-round sweep, the Boston Celtics enter their Eastern Conference semifinals matchup with the defending champion Milwaukee Bucks loaded with confidence  https://t.co/g2SZEryazp@CSource97 @STR8Homah @xmariomc @HaakonMusic @ThereGoBrandon @celtics At the end of this it will be fun.

They lived with others taking better shots. If the big 2 made difficult shots (which they’ve been known to do) they would’ve been in trouble. Just didn’t happen this time.@xmariomc @STR8Homah @CSource97 @HaakonMusic @ThereGoBrandon @celtics Dude stop looking at numbers and look at game flow. Celtics are dangerous. If numbers mattered nets should’ve won.@CSource97 @CyrexPlex @xmariomc @ThereGoBrandon @HaakonMusic @celtics You'll see, kid. You are 100% stuck in 2021. How did 4 players get beat by only 6 points in Milwaukee vs a fully healthy Bucks team? I've watched, or been at, every Celtics game longer than you've been alive. This isn't just a hobby for me.
#Bleedgreen #WayofLife #UsvsEverybodyNow I'm watching the @RocPressBox talk about the @BrooklynNets...

Look... the Nets beat themselves. Honestly. 
They played lethargically at a time even Vegas had them as a favorite. They had no answer for the @Celtics. But i wouldn't say rebuild yet.

Bucks played well without Kris vs a banged up downward trending Bulls team. Suns had competitive games minus Book vs an upward trending Pelicans. Pels won 60% of their games W/CJ &amp;BI, 80% after 1st 5.@kirkgoldsberry @Bucks @dallasmavs @MiamiHEAT @celtics @Suns @warriors @memgrizz @chicagobulls @nuggets this is about the how many games you played and the stats you made.

NBA gotta do somethingThe Boston Celtics play basketball tomorrow https://t.co/aavXhsVoNWThe @Celtics are hot and the Bucks are banged up.

Zero rest excuse 7 months down the line doesn’t hold up, especially when they had, what, 3 weeks less?
2. Know where you are on the court and don’t go 0-6 in OT
3. Can only play the team in front of you. Also they beat the sixers.
4. CP3 played every game + Giannis was hurt
🤡@KeepIt100TW @CJSquareAnis @NBATV Tatum IS a great player. Luka is on track to be one of the all-time greats. Jayson Tatum is not. This is not a controversial viewpoint.

2. The nets without kyrie (took 7 games and 1/2 shoe size to big for KD to win)
3. A bad lucky hawks team

I’m not saying it can’t be done but let’s see what he does when adversity strikes. Coaching is big in these games so does he have the experience to adjust 🤷🏻‍♂️@HaakonMusic @xmariomc @CSource97 @STR8Homah @celtics They don’t need to imo. If they can hit shots early and make it uncomfortable that’s all they need.Three things to watch in Boston Celtics vs. milwaukee bucks https://t.co/Xq4eLlxrLn@CyrexPlex @HaakonMusic @CSource97 @STR8Homah @celtics There is no exposing the Bucks they won the title and they are missing a all star player.

Celtics too deep and can correct mistakes fast. No one is getting past them.@HaakonMusic @CyrexPlex @CSource97 @STR8Homah @celtics I can’t agree because he makes some big clutch shots at times and the NBA is still about shot making in the end. Plus he kills Boston so it’s a loss however if Portis and Allen play well they will still take the series I believe. Giannis is to good and driven to Win!@celtics Damn early game but ready for it@celtics got the best chance to beat the @Bucks ‼️@HaakonMusic @CSource97 @xmariomc @STR8Homah @celtics Just wait.
