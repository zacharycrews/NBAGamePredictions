This is the first year I didn't get BYU gear (I have, ahem, a lot.) But I got a surprise #UtahJazz sweatshirt, so we all win!My take from NBA on ESPN saying Donovan Mitchell is the best player in Utah Jazz franchise history. My say? Oh no! Why? Look at what “The Mail Man” did in his career, look at John Stockton. 2 guys that are NBA All Time greats. I don’t want to hear Mitchell is No1 YET! #NBA https://t.co/uxLTAT4Lnbfor christmas my whole family is going to a @utahjazz game and if that isn’t goals idk what is@OMcconnor @rare_mid @kirkgoldsberry @cavs @memgrizz @utahjazz @warriors @Suns You mean the 2016 Warriors that had a 3-1 lead in the Finals until our Cleveland Cavaliers won 3 straight, right? 😉

You're right tho. That was an alltime great team, making that CLE title *that* much more memorable &amp; meaningful, as the '14 title means to you guys, I'm sure.I'm a Utah Jazz fan but this is fucking great. 😂❤ https://t.co/34nABZaeDb@ExtendDeJong @thescrawnyboi @utahjazz @spidadmitchell Haha.
