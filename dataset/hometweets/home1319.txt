Also you better be rooting for them because Dolby was founded in SF. 

And also, because the Boston @celtics can kiss my ass. They suck.Boston is 13-2 with 15 or less turnovers. 0-5 with 16 or more. They've been outscored 73-38 in the third so far this series. If the @celtics can control their turnovers they should win tonight.

#️⃣ #NBAFinals https://t.co/Cn5xxWkspQFROM START TO FINISH @celtics DON'T LET UP ‼️ #AllAbout18@celtics Can we please put Steph on his ass when he drives to the rim. And that big mouth Draymond up. Thanks@GizmoRulz_ @celtics i want nothing more than to see u suffer on the timeline.@IQEnjoyer @GoIdenState @warriorsvox @celtics Have you seen Boston shoot?I'll be rooting for @celtics tonight. #nbafinalsJo Jo White. Boston Celtics. Champion. I miss him. 

 https://t.co/uWAXiOw7dp@rick_kay_ @Dreddras1 @IQEnjoyer @GoIdenState @warriorsvox @celtics Obviously counting on noone noticing it's off, til it's too late.

Unfortunately they failed lol.@Dreddras1 @IQEnjoyer @GoIdenState @warriorsvox @celtics I mean it's reeeeal simple. The same Celtics maintenance staffer responsible for it, "just so happens" to notice it's off, AFTER the Warriors shoot around is over. That or they're ordered to do "one last check." 

Boom. "Magically fixed."please win @celtics@NBAHistory @NBA @celtics @BillWalton Go CelticsLet go @celtics. Let do this again. 👏 https://t.co/2xKvpR7mlyLiterally just don’t lose a quarter by 20 points and you’re good @celtics. Don’t embarrass me@dobsonbutter @MVG7113 @celtics Solid@andrewbogut @celtics It's funny how the Boston Celtics slogan is #webleedGreen when some vaccinated mother's are producing blue-green breast milk for their babies 😦@KNBR @NBCSWarriors @celtics Come on man.

Lol then they're delusional. It's obvious Warriors are better. Maybe if celtics had a healthy, explosive Rob Williams. But they don't. Seems They only have a passive "happy to be in the finals" Tatum 🤦🏽‍♂️ #CelticsIguodala's mentorship to Poole will be big going forward

There has been one constant when watching Warriors practice, one day before their loss to the Boston Celtics in Game 1 of the NBA Finals and two days after. 

https://t.co/bZ0TUaUNn5 #WarriorsMoment https://t.co/hX5OJB7pK9@celticsblog I am pumped and expecting a great game by the @celtics tonight to go up 2-1!!!!If @Loon_Rebel5 has more O-rebounds than the entire @celtics team tonight, I’ll abandon #Monkeypoxalypse and return to accountability on the O-boards. Probably 6-7 O-rebounds is all you need, good kid. In fairness, it’s hard for @Loon_Rebel5 because @warriors don’t often miss.🏀@celtics Remember how to play basketball in the 3rd pls@celtics @Nelly_Mo Boston strong baby@celtics I couldn’t bring my jersey to work but I’ll leave it here for luck ☘️👏 @jaytatum0 @celtics lets fucking gooooooo 🔥💚 https://t.co/McvFghNtpp@celtics i don't want cry@JenniferEffect @celtics That’s nice 🔥Jayson Tatum of the Boston Celtics has been on fire at home lately.

Henderson/Getty Images)              Through two games, Boston Celtics’ first team All-NBA forward Jayson Tatum is a -20 in plus/minus and is shooting 30 percent from the field with a TS% of 46.9.

https://t.co/a8DaW2IqJn https://t.co/VflA91QcDI@celtics Need all hands on deck. Tatum, Brown, Smart, Horford, White, G Williams, and Pritchard need to put the ball in the basket. Full team effort on both ends. Praying that Rob can move around and give us decent minutes but he’s clearly not 100%.@celtics In the 80s the Garden had hidden dead spots. “You have to be a sure dribbler,” said Chris Ford, “I never tried to do anything fancy. I remember when Ray Williams was here a few years ago, he’d try one of his fancy moves and the ball never came up”.@celtics Gotta make the time spent putting those shirts up worth while. Let’s get this W! #AllAbout18About 2 1/2 more hours. I want to hear that arena shaking through my TV.

Tatum can't disappear either.

Let’s go @celtics #GoGreen #BostonCeltics https://t.co/GoPwOPwSgG@Mind0faMan_ @FinsFan07MAR88 @celtics The only difference is Boston traded for KG &amp; Ray which we had to give up picks and other pieces for. Miami signed Bron and Bosh as free agents so y’all literally just bought them. Didn’t have to trade for them or lose any pieces or picks. Doesn’t change how I feel ultimately but@EvanApplebaum2 @Senita_B370 @warriors @celtics True.

They weren't blaming the refs because Horford was shooting lights out. The difference is the Warriors are mentally tough.

#NBA #NBAFinals #AllAbout18 #DubNation@zbrown2times @treyceltics @wmBailey96 @celtics What's nonsense is a Celtics fan on Twitter basically admitting his team is soft as Charmin because they couldn't get over a bad call made it the 1st quarter.@EvanApplebaum2 @celtics @warriors @985TheSportsHub the Finals could be over by that.
But pro tip for next season:
You can exchance paper that is cut and written on, we call it money, for tickets. Just need a lot of it.@Patriots @celtics Only championship your city has a chance at winning cause the Lombardi won’t be coming back this century.The Boston Celtics are playing basketball in June.

And they called a foul on Brown when he didn’t even touch GP2‼️Game day‼️ (2) Boston Celtics will host the (3) Golden State Warriors in game 3 of the NBA Finals. 

The Series now shifts to Boston, and the Celtics have a golden opportunity to bounce back at home.

I take that as a positive.

#AllAbout18@celtics need to sign @iam_sheed to a 10-day contract to handle @Money23Green for the rest of The Finals. 😅@NEBeerCommunity @TreeHouseBrewCo @celtics I love Green and wish I had more of your beer.   

You both have me wondering how I can I get this beer.  
(And that’s how I am spending my day, sorry boss)Please do not turn the ball over all night @celticsBelieve it or not…Jordan Poole hit this for “Winning Shot” Wednesday at the end of the 3rd quarter to bury the @celtics❗️

Who do you have hitting the finishing shot today?

https://t.co/IFhrPZL2sg@celtics I'm believe #18@NBA is attempting to control the outcome of the finals by assigning specific Rs to the @celtics games. Forster does not like the @warriors and tonight. @NBA wants the finals to be extremely difficult for both teams but not really. Watch the calls tonight. @FirstTake @espn@gbcaboston @NBA @tdgarden @celtics @universalhub @VisitBostonCity @VisitMA @VisitBoston @Mott1103 @bxpboston @delawarenorth @koop_bjk For those of your customers planning to watch at the local bars, we can be of help when it comes to getting seats.Game 3. TONIGHT. ☘️🏆🙏🏻.
