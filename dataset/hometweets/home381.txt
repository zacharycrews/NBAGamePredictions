I SWEAR if this game sucks imma break my TV. Hornets/Kings give up 120+ points each tonight, book it.

#AllFly | @LendingTree https://t.co/QhBkrxM7pR@HornetsPR @hornets Does this mean they are not VAX??@RS02NY @NY_KnicksPR @Ticketmaster @TMFanSupport same thing for @hornets @HornetsPR.  I'm a season ticket holder, purchased an upgraded seat for tonight's game, and now my original that I listed for resale, at the lowest cost I was allowed to do so, is hidden from view.Yes there are attractive free agents in 2022 but they may want to go to contending teams, etc. which leaves Charlotte in the cold again. If I’m Mitch, I’d trade for Myles Turner by 12/15/21 while I have a chance. Gut feeling it’s happening. #Hornets #AllflyA key thing about (off season) #Hornets trades that Mitch &amp; MJ have said in separate interviews is that players “have to want to come to Charlotte” &amp;  how during their pursuit, players chose elsewhere.
