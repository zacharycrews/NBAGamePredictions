As for your other stuff (Rockets fan here), he was gone from Houston before Harden or Wall trades.

Should be noted during his tenure, he had the 2nd most wins in the NBA (more than the Warriors).

I thought the goal was to make it better than you got it, Rocket fans may beg to differThe point that Joe is trying to say is where is Daryl Morley that was doing all those trades when he was with the Houston rockets so far since he's been with the Sixers he has done absolutely nothing that catches headlines@cayleighgriffin @HoustonRockets @ATTSportsNetSW 102% better than the original. 😄@benbbaldwin The big issue to me is the sample size is just too small.
