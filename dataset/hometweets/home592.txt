Yep, Golden State Warriors won 2015, 17, and 18.

It happened.

No mention of getting Dray suspended for game 5 and Bogut getting injured in game 5?

(A healthy Cavs team was down 3-1 to Warriors.)#KlayyDayy @KlayThompson @warriors splash bros back togetherReady for the #GoldenStateWarriors game so all this talk about Klay’s big return can stop.
