#WesternConference #NBAthere's something good to learn from from Mikal Bridges and Javale McGee from the @Sunsi don’t know if it’s the 8h taurus sun or the virgo moon but being famous or known is my biggest fear mainly because it’s so fucking annoying? people always characterize joaquin phoenix as being ‘stand-off ish’ for this but i disagree &amp; in fact, i understand him? leave me aloneThe @suns got CP3 and he’s turned the franchise around.  The @utahjazz got Mike Conley their biggest hole remains PG play.Magics vs Phoenix Suns who would win?@RPongratz @Suns @clegainz How cool, very nice@RPongratz @Suns You’re welcome!! 🎄 🎁Just noticed I was gifted a @suns Crowder moment by @clegainz.

They could use another vet for the postseason run!12/18/93 – Charles Barkley (bad back, pulled left hamstring, a bad right groin) managed a near triple-double (20p/10r/9a), although it wasn't to his liking. Regardless, the Phoenix #Suns held off the Clippers, 116-109. Majerle: 28p. Green: 25p/7r. KJ: 21p/7a/5s. #ValleyProud https://t.co/pbPUPg4Cbv@Phoenix_xii without rain there would be no Flowers. Everything happens for a reason and those bad/sad times not only help you grow and help you become better than you were before but they also make the good times sweeter. So just sit tight. The rain will clear.
