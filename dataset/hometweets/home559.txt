DIRK FOREVER #MFFL https://t.co/NHYmEgnPUATonight the @dallasmavs will retire the jersey of @swish41. I have more on the court memories of Dirk Nowitzki’s greatness than I can count, but this off the court memory — when he showed my mom some love — might be my favorite. Thanks for the memories, 🐐. ❤️ ya! https://t.co/7fDyWHZzLbDirk showed me how to play the game of basketball with passion. He led by example. He put the @dallasmavs on his back and said, “follow me.” And in doing so, he united us all. Not just as #MFFL’s, but as people. For the City of Dallas, Dirk is our real life Pegasus.#BestBets for some of these @nba games tonight. 👀🤑

Nice. Yeah man I’ve been lucky enough to be close to him at least 2X or so.To honour @swish41 having his jersey retired tonight by the @dallasmavs - here's a thread of some of his funniest moments 🧵😅

Start by taking a look at his penalty tekkers 👀⚽️ https://t.co/Bz0OkOft6n@jaymart104 @Mavs_FFL @redditmavericks @HouseMavericks @swish41 @The_MFFLs @1053SS @dallasmavs Dude…. This is bad ass!
This is the closest I ever been to the GOAT 😮‍💨 https://t.co/hJEKzO8uiM@NBAAnalytics2 @luka7doncic @dallasmavs @JaMorant Exactly 🤣🤣🤣🤣Happy Dirk day! 41 jersey retired 🐐 Excited to be at the AAC for the first time since the last Dirk Day…@swish41’s final home game @dallasmavs https://t.co/BinDCVhWCt'41 Forever': Dallas Mavericks to retire Dirk Nowitzki’s No. 41 jersey https://t.co/Sd2wPDUSec@allball1977 @luka7doncic @dallasmavs @JaMorant Which blows my mind coz I really wasn't very high on Ja but honestly feels great to be proven wrongI was about to start 2nd grade when Dirk was drafted (via trade) to the Dallas Mavericks in 1998 and he retired when I was nearly 28 years old. 

Thanks for the lifetime of memories @swish41 #MFFL https://t.co/XUUqNIYeXx@NBAAnalytics2 @luka7doncic @dallasmavs At least in the conversation. @JaMorant jumped right pass him@allball1977 @luka7doncic @dallasmavs I thought he'd be MVP tbh but ig notHappy Dirk Day #41Forever #MFFL @dallasmavs WE LOVE DIRK!!!!!! 🏀 https://t.co/aozSnhxod5I cried when he retired and I will probably cry tonight when THE GREATEST DALLAS MAVERICK OF ALL TIME Dirk Nowitzki gets his jersey retired and hung up in the rafters of the AAC. Tonight is going to be so fun and I can’t wait. #41Forever #MFFLToday is a good day. Today, Dirk Nowitzki’s 41 jersey will be retired by the Dallas Mavericks. 

#MFFL 🐐🥺 https://t.co/Rq6reBqjvEWe pay money just like full regular season ticket holders do.

They took down the Trail Blazers, back-to-back defending-champs Lakers, the Big 3 in OKC, and the newly-formed Big 3 in Miami. This run cemented Dirk Nowitzki as one of the all-time greats.Since then day I’ve been a #MFFL &amp; Dirk has changed the way I looked at basketball &amp; respect.
