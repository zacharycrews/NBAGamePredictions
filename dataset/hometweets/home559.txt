They took down the Trail Blazers, back-to-back defending-champs Lakers, the Big 3 in OKC, and the newly-formed Big 3 in Miami. This run cemented Dirk Nowitzki as one of the all-time greats.Since then day I‚Äôve been a #MFFL &amp; Dirk has changed the way I looked at basketball &amp; respect. Every time I got the chance as a little kid in nashville I would tune in to as many @dallasmavs as I could, I vividly remember as a 6 year old the heartbreak I felt after the 2006 finals https://t.co/iBbNJZrt3i@dallasmavs AKA ‚ÄúThe House that Dirk Built‚Äù https://t.co/JiFQ7qz8aDAs the @warriors face off against the @dallasmavs tomorrow, take a look back to when @StephenCurry30 exploded for 4‚É£8‚É£ points against the Mavs! üí•
