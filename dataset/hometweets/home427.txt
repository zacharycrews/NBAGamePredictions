Regardless, here's my latest for @SBD looking at the game and providing my prediction and best bet: https://t.co/VXXTuhQQzDThe Brooklyn Nets have officially signed free agent guard Langston Galloway to a 10-day contract. 

He posted 12 points, seven assists, three rebounds and a steal for the College Park Skyhawks in Tuesday’s win over the Raptors 905.

 #Brooklyn_NetsGreat game last night @BrooklynNets #bk #nyc https://t.co/XnJKpZgVaa@Gbc1235 @LeDoma6 @bulls_pain That’s not up to the nba, firstly up to the state of New York and subsequently the Brooklyn nets organization. The point is to influence people to get vaccinated buddy. The vaccine reduces hospitalization by 97%, that’s the point.@statmuse @KDTrey5 @BrooklynNets Durant going to injure himself playing these many minutes man, I’m worried@BrooklynNets go get @isaiahthomas pleaseWe gonna have a conversation real soon @BrooklynNets@C_Arnold01 @NYIHockeyNow @amNewYork @TheBKGame I’m on nets republic! See you in Brooklyn@EvanColer2022 @Pacers And the @BrooklynNets should trade @KDTrey5 because he leads them in missed shots.

#CryptoNews https://t.co/IVgdQsKE7J@BrooklynNets @KDTrey5 Announce Kyrie@NeilMcMahon Look overseas. Brooklyn Nets played a game with only 8 players available. One was injured and rest in Covid protocols.Check out my latest piece on the @sixers  falling to the @MiamiHEAT and what they need to do to prepare for the @BrooklynNets  tomorrow night. #NBA #76ers #Nets #Heat #HereTheyCome #trusttheprocess #PhillySports https://t.co/P8kROmGuW0@isaiahthomas u need to get on that nets team @BrooklynNets@BrooklynNets covid got us short handed give bro a 10 day https://t.co/q9yg1SysBxThis is just like Kobe dunking over Brook Lopez, Gerard Wallace and the Brooklyn Nets. Huge Slam https://t.co/auHASvfTt7Joel Embiid played 37 minutes tonight in the loss to Miami and had a slight injury scare in the final minute of the loss. Thankfully he was good. 

The Sixers, who are now 5.5 games behind the Nets in the standings, play Brooklyn tomorrow night.Brooklyn Nets should sign Isaiah Thomas 🤷🏽‍♂️The Brooklyn Nets star turned Skip Bayless' gush into mush. https://t.co/2C6yGSiqUC via @HuffPostEnt@BrooklynNets @KDTrey5 Kevin Durant emerges as the one, true leader, like a General directing his gladiator forces into the Brooklyn night…Tough Sixers loss against an undermanned Miami squad…First half was brutal, but PHI fought hard in the second half, rallying back from 23. Joel Embiid misses the potential game-tying three. 

Sixers head to Brooklyn, and take on the Nets tomorrow.Embiid misses a three with 0:01.2 to go, and this one is just about done. The comeback effort was commendable, but this is a brutal loss to a team that the Sixers should have been able to handle with ease. The Sixers are now 15-14 and face the Brooklyn Nets tomorrow night.@Keith_McPherson Brooklyn Nets bouquet@LenPeralta @NBA @cavs @BrooklynNets Just ignoring the Bulls @LenPeralta?
