Tail or Fade!@nyknicks @wcknicks #CBSSports IF ONLY THEY DRAFTED JA MORANT!#RAMSFANSINCE69@GusGreen18 @nfl1993 @nyknicks Well who else is actually hyped to be a star in this league? JA is probably the only other guy who’s not in year 1 and he’s  going to be an all star 

Like I said, if you don’t think RJ will be a superstar he’s doing just fine 

What’s your expectations for RJ? Just wonderingYou better give him a nice tribute @nyknicks https://t.co/LXV1UkoUDN@MulloSZNv5 @nfl1993 @nyknicks Zion was the number #1 overall pick, the most hyped prospect since Lebron and has only played 85 games. Being consistent, means actually playing. SGA is 23. 2 years older than RJ. When RJ is 23 you can compare them. I already said Luka. So try again.@twentee7 @CarlBanksGIII @BobPapa_NFL @GiantInsider @nyknicks GI is a grade A loser@anthonyraia_ @CarlBanksGIII @BobPapa_NFL @GiantInsider @nyknicks This is the guy you want to talk to Carl? Someone who’s sophistication in analyzing a GM amounts to “he’s not Reese so not worth critiquing”? Someone who weaponizes followers with lies because he can’t articulate a counter argument? Like I said, you’re far better than this https://t.co/QwgdODhZZA@CarlBanksGIII @BobPapa_NFL @GiantInsider @nyknicks I’ll agree with the last two words, but shouldn’t you look for guests who can tolerate respectful disagreements without pivoting to name calling?

Take your jealousy elsewhere

What buster did wasn’t illegal … was it a bit of a lie? A fabricated story? Yes, but not illegal 

New York use to have a law on the books where it was illegal to NOT offer an alternative to mobile tickets@natsturner @PRyanTexas @darrenrovell @PSAcard @TheGarden @nyknicks @ENaierman @HallofStubs @boss1marc @TickPick @NickCepero @icollectticket1 @SportsCollector @KenGoldin @JoePompliano @BusterScher I’m sure you asked respectfully and didn’t show them a “fake cracked phone”. Ethically this is wrong and he deceived MSG on purpose, he thinks because he’s an “influencer” he can get away with it?I think this is the beginning of the end of Julius Randle in New York. He ain’t gonna make it here
