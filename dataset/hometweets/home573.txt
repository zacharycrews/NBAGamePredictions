HOWEVER, AT THIS TIME YOU ARE A CHICAGO BULL, AND SO YOUR BIRTHDAY IS A NATIONAL HOLIDAY TO ME. HAPPY BIRTHDAY JORDAN BELL. ENJOY YOUR FUTURE CHAMPIONSHIP AS A CHICAGO BULL AND ENJOY YOUR DAY.@chicagobulls Warriors are the only team out West that worries me. We couldn't handle them, minus Klay. I mean, we didn't have Vuc, and Caruso did a good job, trying to defend Curry, but still. I'd be lying if u said Im Confident about us beating them in a 7 game series. We still needed pieces@chicagobulls @1jordanbell Bulls Legend@erikneff86 @ChiBDM @chicagobulls When the Cards tweet out their Pride Night it seems like every other tweet is homophobic🏀@ESPNNBA schedule update: ESPN has added the @Warriors vs. @ChicagoBulls game at 7:30P ET on Fri, Jan. 14. It will be subject to local blackout restrictions in Golden State's home market. This replaces the previously scheduled Boston Celtics vs. Philadelphia 76ers game on ESPN.Happy Birthday, @1jordanbell 🎉 https://t.co/KdWILVtP6X@zhsmith4 @chicagobulls @ZachLaVine @hornets LaMelo deserves all star but they have demar as a guard so it should be demar and Zach@chicagobulls Its about time we get a national gameWhen I see a move like this, I always think back to Marc Eversley's statement at his introductory news conference in the Spring of 2020 when he said he wanted to help make the @chicagobulls "Cool" again. Every passing week, it seems that goal is being accomplished. https://t.co/wl48C8UjGm@janehic03089864 @chicagobulls Every other night@chicagobulls one by one guys, lets get the W with Wizards first@chicagobulls Primetime Bulls are back!!! https://t.co/Fer5MCQryjHavent played the @chicagobulls 🤷🏾‍♂️‼💯 https://t.co/2ucT0WsNQD@chicagobulls holy W@ChiTownSports @ChiBDM @chicagobulls Cards fan here.

I feel like they will rewatch the game and figure out what they did wrong and beat y’all on our court btw.@chicagobulls That’s really cool and awesome to support a teammate like Ayo! Thanks DeMar!👏💕🔥@chicagobulls Perfect, cant wait for the game@cyilcal @jackdacubsfan @chicagobulls I remember Billy Donovan saying that he was able to move around and do drills or something like that but he hasn't made any contact yet@chicagobulls Don’t support gay pride sorry@chicagobulls Finally!

Changes in Windy City?
sources say that Bulls Front Office spoke with 3 GMs for a trade, the GMs didnt even listen.
Who are Bulls trying to move? McGlocklin or McKinley?
I guess they dont like Scottsmen in Chicago.The #ChicagoBulls are in first place in the Eastern Conference? There's too much important stuff to know.@tony_tennyson @chicagobulls seriously bro ?Is anyone out for the Bulls tonight? Chicago -6.5 at home vs the Wizards. I think that's a little short.

Washington is not good ATS on the road. Bull are 8-2 in the last 10.

Find you a teammate like that. @chicagobulls@ChristianArcand  You know what's interesting? The Chicago Bulls did exactly what we hoped the #Celtics would do with their "assets."  
They flipped crap for DeRozan. 
They flipped crap for Lonzo Ball (sign and trade)
The Celtics just held on to their crap.@chicagobulls Love this!
