Must be following me. Enter by 3pm! https://t.co/mPlDQHoFl5How much can opponent shooting luck swing things this early in the season?

@DetroitPistons opponents are shooting a spicy 43.6% from three thus far. If opponents were shooting 36% (2021 average), their defensive rating would improve from 21st to 3rd!

https://t.co/AoNKVLSsvcWhile Ben Simmons is too talented for the Detroit Pistons to ignore, the past few months have given the organization some pause. And the Pistons likely can’t muster a package grand enough to satisfy the Sixers. 

https://t.co/3HrLvSLd7vIf the Sixers don’t come back around tonight and lose to the Detroit Pistons on a back-to-back then this team is DIFFERENTI’m finally going to a @DetroitPistons game since moving to the area, all I ask is for @CadeCunningham_ to wave at me because I swear we locked eyes at Summer League and he didn’t wave back. I’m convinced that’s why his shooting marks are down@DetroitPistons Can we get "Cade in the city jersey" wallpaper next week?Philadelphia 76ers @ Detroit Pistons
Pick : Philadelphia 76ers.
Basketball. NBAThe good news is that the Detroit Pistons are making history! The bad news is that it isn't the good kind. These numbers on wide-open shots are mind boggling

Stephen Curry and the Warriors just passed the Miami Heat for league's best team defensive rating. They're on pace to be the best defense since the '04 Detroit Pistons.
