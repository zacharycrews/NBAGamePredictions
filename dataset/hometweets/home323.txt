Hilarious@wojespn FYI I‚Äôm still waiting for your apology to the @bucks.So let me get this straight: The Bucks got the same penalty as these two teams even though the NBA found ZERO evidence of tampering by Milwaukee and both of these teams were found in violation of the rules? Make it make sense https://t.co/0zBnUFLo2cFour months to do anything and yet they get the same punishment as the @bucks while ALSO GETTING THE PLAYERS THEY WANTED. @nba and @wojespn are absolute frauds.

Pathetic. https://t.co/SDJJSFhBB3So, basically, they got the same punishment that the Milwaukee Bucks got when the Bucks did *not* acquire Bogdan Bogdanovic? And the Chicago Bulls and Miami Heat actually acquired the players they tampered for. Alright.
