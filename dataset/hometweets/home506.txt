Lol!@WarWood313 @JorExposed @eugenemangune @DeathEater826 @ESPNStatsInfo To make it more clear, LBJ is basically built like a slightly shorter, slightly more muscular Karl Malone. Look at what Malone did to the Detroit Pistons the next game after playing them in Detroit in a game with 6 Ts and Sloan getting into it with Rodman.

Tray should have taken a Cup winners medal back home with him.@IsiahThomas @DetroitPistons @Lakers @NBA Keep telling the story of the Pistons Zeke. They have shut you down for too long. You went against the establishment went toe to toe against Bird, Magic, and Jordan and beat them all.

Saw a lot of him in person that year and there was a game late in the season at EIS were he was sensational, particularly the first half.  I don’t remember all the players and teams like you, Dan, Philip do, but him and most of that Worcester team I do remember well.@nezbit23 @MotorCityCruise @TriggaTrayP @DetroitPistons Yip. Tried to sign him the following year but off to France Pro B for too much £££!@shieldsbrief @MotorCityCruise @TriggaTrayP @DetroitPistons He was so good. Plug and play probably doesn’t do him justice as he was better than that, but the best sort of plug and play guy I can remember in BBL for some time. That whole Worcester team they ended the year with was actually rather good.The Detroit Pistons had some optimism going into the season upon moving conferences and drafting Bob Lanier #1 overall.

Dave Bing was healthy again and Jimmy Walker was coming off his best ever season. It was time for another playoff push.
