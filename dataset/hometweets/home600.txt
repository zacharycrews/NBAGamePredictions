But up until now his pick &amp; roll d was sagging 10’ into the paint. Giving up wide open jumpers to the guards or running starts at the rim for the big or guard.

https://t.co/3gpJMk0fhU https://t.co/szq1Zps1QONot sure why the @trailblazers aren’t in full pursuit of Jerami Grant. The Pistons could use a CJ McCollum to help develop and mentor their young guards. You guys can gladly take Robert Covington too 😂😂😂@nbatopshot @trailblazers @rippackscity @scottyj111 @OneLuckG Sounds like two winners here.📅 On this day in 1986, Clyde Drexler had a triple-double in a loss to the Bucks, tying the @trailblazers single-game record for steals:

✅ 26 PTS
✅ 11 AST
✅ 10 STL
✅ 9 REB 

It was one of two times in Drexler's career he missed a quadruple-double by one in a single category. https://t.co/LCXG4tdn0vThe Washington Wizards, New York Knicks, Portland Trail Blazers and Los Angeles Lakers are among the teams interested in Jerami Grant per @ShamsCharania https://t.co/ZHIC7xazavIf we are doing a one year franchise reset then it sounds like the perfect opportunity to let go of the alleged rapist coach who has done a piss poor job so far. @trailblazers https://t.co/WNk1KCZ9WS@KommonCollector @trailblazers @SacramentoKings @dapperlabs That S1 set is gonna look great in 5+ years!UTAH JAZZ -11
