https://t.co/8O6zxRFOLJ@ShaZ___01 @Suns That's why we'll always be friends. Mutual self-loathing 😂Wait. Huh? They beat a very good Phoenix Suns team with two hall of famers and one of the best players in Chris Paul to ever play the game. How does that title not count? If you’re on drugs just say that. Suns are a legit team and Bucks beat them in finals. Can’t discount that. https://t.co/3yeFyQ7Z8E@Sweat__bets Suns/Jazz is a tough one to predict for me. I expect most will be on Utah considering they’re coming off a good W and the Suns are coming off a bad L (and are obviously without Paul). The Jazz haven’t won in Phoenix since 2019 though.

Hoping for a Dubs/Suns WCFinals for the ages!@Suns Hope they won't end up like Lakers one year from now.... 🤣🤣@JRhein98 @Max_Atttack Used to happen with Mark West of the @Suns all the time back in the day.2/26/03 – Stephon Marbury scored 18p in the 3Q and 17p in the 4Q en route to 41p/7a, and 5-6 from 3 as the Phoenix #Suns escaped Milwaukee with a 118-112 win, snapping a four-game losing streak. JJ had 20p/7r/4a (4-6 from 3). STAT: 12p/14r. Kukoc/Payton/Cassell: 73p. #ValleyProud https://t.co/mqTxKjacV1@redsoxandstuff The Celtics were playing the Suns, but the game was in Boston. If they had been on the road in Phoenix that day you could have had 14 hours in between start times.@Desertcanuck @Suns @suns_tutu_fan @angelinams112 So awesome. I'd love to win. Al McCoy night? Been listening to his magical voice for 35 years.@Desertcanuck @Suns @suns_tutu_fan @angelinams112 I vouch for @_Antoons_This is not Phil and Bones. Sarver and Fitz… @CologuardGolf @suns https://t.co/vGdgxMEEvr@hiramboyd @wear_athletic @JohnnyGoodberry @william_risman @CollinSexton02 With the Phoenix Suns you know you have to stop there top guy if you want to beat them Chris Paul's going to be. Sis guy and a guy who sets the offense up but Devin Booker is there go to Guy@hiramboyd @hot_route @Gbush91 The Cavaliers don't run their team the same way as the Phoenix Suns@Yaurislluberes @NBA @PelicansNBA @Suns @CJMcCollum @B_Ingram13 Lol. your right man. It's win the title or bust. This isn't an entertainment industry@OhHeyYourself Please drop Phoenix Suns from your bio. You’re embarrassing us.@beaner228922 @dizzyizzy70 @Suns Remind me what’s the suns record vs the injured warriors this season@Blunt_Doctor_RX @Suns Also, once the decision is made that’s my team for life. I will watch the rest of the season, see if I vibe with a team &amp; use the off season to make a decision.@Suns @campayne @AzMilkProducers Me going to the game tomorrow https://t.co/rohCPSjBeG@Suns @campayne @AzMilkProducers I am now 15 years old@DavidGo91665851 @RaygunGaming @LilMonsterJDR @ethanjd12 @SuckingOnCock @Suns @FanDuel That’s why I said ironic@ShaZ___01 @Suns Lolol I get that, don't want to get dragged by Twitter 😂@lukemcdee21 I blame the Phoenix suns for your confidence, it'll be sad when u go out in the WCF 🚶🏾‍♂️@Blunt_Doctor_RX @Suns That is lovely, I’m glad to hear it. All good here, thanks for asking. Yeah that is very tempting, my slight issue is that they are good at the moment &amp; top of the western conference so it feels like I’m jumping on the bandwagon.The Phoenix Suns undefeated all time when playing Sunday on ABC2/26/71 – Connie Hawkins' 30p/17r/11a triple-double &amp; Paul Silas' 12p/24r helped pull the #Suns out of a 10 point deficit w/only a few minutes before half, as Phoenix went on an incredible 22-3 run to end the 2Q on their way to defeat the Philadelphia 76ers, 108-94. #ValleyProud https://t.co/om3vQEwOrq@Suns good job 🇺🇸@ShaZ___01 @Suns We've never won a championship so it's always fun to root for stuff like that. And thank you, my fiancee is singing made up songs to him and he is laughing so it's going well lol. I hope you and everyone you know are safe over there@Suns @campayne @AzMilkProducers NBA: Phoenix Suns, I do not like the party mode you guys seemed to be on...celebration before the fat lady sings is problematic.this is definitely not the time to lose focus... and for there is a bigger picture, 'Championship trophy.@PokaTBH @NBA @PelicansNBA @Suns @CJMcCollum @B_Ingram13 Don’t care, plus you like anime@lindseyrbhair @Suns Can he play point guard?@Blunt_Doctor_RX @Suns It’s on the table. There are various no go teams for me, no Lakers, no NY teams. I’d like to pick a non-traditional team, not one of the big names. Thanks for the suggestion man. Hope all is well with you and the kid.
