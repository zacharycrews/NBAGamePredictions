He said "That's pissing New Orleans style."@nattypools @dallasmavs @Chime @mcuban Because they can actually play their role.

So... life is generally still good.@OstregaLuca @dallasmavs @Chime This roster without luka would probably be the worst in the whole leagueWhen is the last season @mcuban the @dallasmavs had a real home court advantage!?
