https://t.co/Ulir7abX4qOn offense, they're going to hunt White or Pritchard w Jimmy. Bam will set (comically illegal) screens on the weak-side for Strus and Lowry. The Heat are going to put all the pressure on the refs tn. If refs call it fair, Miami will once again complain about ft discrepancy.@celtics @MiamiHEAT @espn @985TheSportsHub @Celtics fans. Give @BaustonSports a follow for all the latest on your favorite teams.3/ But now, in 2022, we have all of these things.

Elon memes Dogecoin on Twitter. The Miami Heat shoot hoops in the FTX Arena. Matt Damon shills crypto to millions during the Super Bowl.

Meanwhile, SBF casually becomes Biden’s second-largest donor. https://t.co/ZswEssLe2dDoes anyone else recall the hysteria of Heat fans after losing game 5 to Boston in 2012? Big three were breaking up, Spo was fired, Bosh traded. You think that hysteria is topped tonight if Miami loses solely because Twitter is more used? I think so... https://t.co/ORuZQz71jKMiami is going to muck up the game to a snail's pace. Foul every possession starting at tip off, forcing the refs to either call everything early, or call nothing. By the third the Heat will put JB and JT in hell w hand-checks and reach-ins.The #BostonCeltics appear to be the more talented team vs the #MiamiHeat. The #Heat though have some tough minded individuals who are capable of shutting teams down through hard nosed defense. I expect that to happen in tonight’s contest….@marviemarv__ @MiamiHEAT He’s coming to ChicagoI AM NOT SCARED OF THE BOSTON CELTICS OR THE MIAMI HEAT.

All nba is a individual award@970TMO_ @johnrosenthal22 @LegionHoops I'm saying they don't step up when it matters. They played like absolute shit against the Heat when Embiid was out. I don't trust that they would've played well without him when they didn't against Miami in the second round which is still further than the 2 time MVP went.@MiamiHeatKennel @TheStevenG @EWiseman0 @MiamiHEAT @D_Bo20 this team and can help in a big way. I just think that if Strus happens to be off with his shooting like he was yesterday, Duncan should get more plays ran for him to see if he can fill that void.@MiamiHeatKennel @TheStevenG @EWiseman0 @MiamiHEAT @D_Bo20 I think Strus is better i'm not denying that he is better at defending and overall finishing. But my point is its been 1 year, I don't think duncan should be playing over him at all but I do think that he shouldn't be evaluated off one year either. Duncan can still contribute to@danewilliamsFL @GioCorner @bigstormzy @MiamiHEAT Yes thats where I saw all 4 teams and cancelled 76ers finals tickets haha@BostonArman @GioCorner @bigstormzy @MiamiHEAT Not on NBA’s official ticketing source they don’t.

But Duncan still has 3 years of proven great shooting under his belt that backs up his skill. Strus has only come in this year doing that.

The series is tied at 2-2 after the Celtics just stomped Miami. Its up to Spoelstra, Jimmy Butler, Bam Adebayo, and some Heat Culture to close out the series and bring us to the NBA finals🍻 https://t.co/sXYaw6p5cAI hope the Warriors lose this game just so they don’t have too much of an advantage over the Miami Heat in the Finals.That’s because the @MiamiHEAT don’t win games.

I bet they are all gonna play (except MAYBE Herro)@juucylucy2c @Palmierijoe13 @OfficialNBARefs @MiamiHEAT @celtics @ABCNetwork Not only do they lose last night but, they get ROMPED Game 3. Heat were so damn good game 3 that refs wouldn’t be able to take it away from them though, they did try. I have ZERO confidence in The @nba or it’s officiating anymore. The league is scripted &amp; just not fun anymore 👎With all this in mind, the @MiamiHEAT will win the 2021-2022 NBA Championship!!

#HEATCulture https://t.co/PSY03KcQ6x@BleacherReport The fact that not a single @MiamiHEAT player is on this list in itself evidence that it’s illegitimate.@javiersayago11 @Palmierijoe13 @OfficialNBARefs @MiamiHEAT @celtics @ABCNetwork Not sure I’d count on that cause we believe the fix is in. The Association wanted Cs to win game 3 and did all they could to give ‘em the most unlikely win after a 26 point deficit. Then, low and behold, Celts come back with trip after trip to the charity stripe. @nba wants Cs.Ofc. The number 1 seeded Miami heat does not have 1 player on any of the 3 teams. #CoolStory https://t.co/zyGoK1FB5X@MiamiHEAT Lol see y’all ain’t got nothing to sayIf the Miami Heat doesn’t have an All-NBA player in their roster then they should’ve given the COTY award to Spo for making them the top seed in the East.

The Boston Celtics responded in game 4 with a blowout victory over the Miami Heat (102-82) and tied the series up 2-2.

Unlike game 3 Boston came out like a team that wanted to win and get back in this series.  #Celtics #Heat

#NBA75 #NBAAwardsI know what you’re thinking: If that’s the case then surely the Miami Heat must have the Coach of the Year for doing such a tremendous job utilizing these unexceptional players to have tied for the 3rd best record in the NBA. But nope, you’d be mistaken.As expected, @MiamiHEAT is the only remaining team in the playoffs without any player making it to the All-NBA team.

And I mean that in the highest compliment. #teambasketball #culture 🔥Wake me up when it’s #NBAFinals 🏆

@AFPPayton Pritchard plays his fifth playoff game against the Miami Heat in 24 hours.Jimmy did not make one All NBA team. I really do not understand but all the more motivation for him and @MiamiHEAT to make the finals...Playoff teams without an All-NBA player in 2022: New Orleans Pelicans (8th in West), Utah Jazz (5th in West), Miami Heat (1st in East)

Heat are first #1 seed in either conference without an All-NBA performer since 2015 Atlanta Hawks@maddmatt1118 @FloridaTruth @MiamiHEAT So the defense was hold Jimmy butler to 6 points good is what you’re saying… okNo All-NBA players. No COTY. No DPOY. But @MiamiHEAT still first seed and in the ECF… The disrespect is hella loud! https://t.co/nCnvHHT3nEHow the hell do the Miami Heat finish as the top seed in the East but have no one on the all NBA teams.

Tatum shot 16 himself and the heat only had 14 in gm4. That's why we are saying its a problem. In Miami we got the call the Celtics got the same call right back. In Boston we foul Celtics and they get FT's we get fouled we get nothingThe Miami Heat, who are the East #1 seed and 2 wins away from reaching the NBA Finals for the 2nd time in 3 seasons somehow don’t have any players worthy enough to make All-NBA 1st, 2nd or 3rd teams.@big_business_ Can we talk about the number 1 East record Miami Heat getting no All-NBA players!!!Are there any adjustments left?
