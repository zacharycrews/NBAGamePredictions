You just can’t tell me you’ve paid attention to him. He’s always been this player. He’s better defensively now but his numbers in Minny are just as good. He’s always been that third option guy. He’s just never been MVP. 3rd option is not a bust 😂Boston Celtics: AP WAS THERE: #Celtics, Suns push through 3 OTs in NBA Finals https://t.co/bpOyT8bDpoBoston Celtics: Golden State #Warriors vs Boston #Celtics Prediction &amp; Match Preview - December 17th, 2021 ... https://t.co/ZzhePrMJXnBoston Celtics: Brad Stevens refutes idea that Danny Ainge was forced from #Celtics job - Yahoo!
