Memphis Grizzlies - Philadelphia 76ers
Tip: Philadelphia 76ers @ 1.61

The Grizzlies might struggle tonight. Adams is most likely out and Jackson doubtful. Those fresh two missings should give the complete edge to the 76ers. Embiid will be free in the paint.The Memphis Grizzlies will win a championship once they acquire Jaylen Brown for Kyle Anderson, De’Anthony Melton and 2 1st round picks https://t.co/GIYNHNmsrGMemphis Grizzlies - Philadelphia 76ers
