More plus the rest of the league (so far) right here: https://t.co/eCiHFQ6wSx https://t.co/bAkbWSrYWVTwitter lean play on the Indiana Pacers in the NBA tonight.  Best of luck to all!  Don‚Äôt forget to grab my Top NHL Best Bet going Monday!  Documented #1 in nhl the past 2 years!Pacers are 1-6. It's been 28 years since a team started 1-6 and made the playoffs.

That team? The 1993-94 Indiana Pacers. 

Those Pacers beat the Celtics to improve to 2-6. Given the injuries to the 2021-22 Pacers, there's a chance but it's clearly not a very good chance.The Pacers unveiled their new City Edition uniforms that honor Slick Leonard and pay tribute to memorable moments from their past.
