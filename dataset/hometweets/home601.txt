What an embarrassment to get blown out by a @trailblazers squad missing Dame, CJ, Norm, and Nance. It would be too complimentary to call that kind of effort pathetic. #RipCity@SacramentoKings really lost to a Blazers team with nobody on it.@SacramentoKings @TyHaliburton22 @alexlen @hbarnes Fuck Alvin Gentry.

Why are Kings officials allowing the bleeding to go on? This team is off the rails &amp; every night this play continues is another painful slap in the face of devoted Sacramento fans who fought so hard to keep this team here. Such disrespect is unacceptable.@LBTWEETFREAK @SacramentoKings Same but things look like they are spirling downward for them!When will opposing teams realize that they can rest their top 10 players and still beat the @SacramentoKings by 15.Damn I wanted the kings to get the dub tn @SacramentoKings@MySnagger @SacramentoKings @TyHaliburton22 @alexlen @hbarnes Some people warned me but I still had a little bit of hope... now I really want Nemi to get traded to some team who play him and show the Kings what they lost.@bosnianbeast27 vs Sacramento Kings

@SacramentoKings @mmcnair@thefriscobay Love this mentality. would your mom be interested in becoming the next coach of the Sacramento Kings?#Sacramento trails Portland 53-40 at halftime from Moda Center. If the @SacramentoKings are going to get a win tonight, they have to take full advantage of no Lillard and no McCollum in the Blazers lineup due to injuries. The Kings host Cleveland, Monday at 7pm Pacific Time.#sacramentokings we saw this last year…Fox scores everything or takes the team down trying…talent for sure but used incorrectly…move the ball around, it’s a team game…I am praying to the gambling gods. Sacramento Kings please win this game 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏Halftime: Blazers 53, Kings 40.

The Kings have 40 points at the half against a Blazers squad that ranks 27th in the NBA in scoring defense, allowing 113.3 points per game. Sacramento is 3 of 19 from 3-point range. Ben McLemore has more points (11) than anyone in a Kings uniform.Do @SacramentoKings only play to their potential when starters are playing against them but then think they can be casual when 3rd string players are playing. I don't get it 🤦🏽‍♀️No reason why my @SacramentoKings is losing to the Blazers who are without there too 3 guys: Dame, CJ, and Powell but yet here we are https://t.co/a9fZRgjXS940 points ties Sacramento’s third lowest scoring half this season. 

They trail Portland by 13 at the half — the Kings 3/19 from three.@SacramentoKings @Verizon @swipathefox @TyHaliburton22 @hbarnes @MB3FIVE @alexlen Sucks!!!@SacramentoKings @TyHaliburton22 @alexlen Send Buddy Heid. Back to his country. Mf has refused to play in NBA.It's not a joke or odd coincidence anymore, the Sacramento Kings play worse and lose more against shorthanded teams missing at least one star.A pretty dreadful first half for the Kings, who trail the Blazers in Portland 53-40. Sacramento shooting 36% led by Tyrese Haliburton's 10 points - the only Kings player in double figures.The Sacramento Kings FUCKKING SUCK!!!@SacramentoKings @hbarnes @hbarnes is a walking bucket. I wish that staff would realize that. 🤦🏾‍♂️@SacramentoKings @Verizon @swipathefox @TyHaliburton22 @hbarnes @MB3FIVE @alexlen Another awful 1st half. #GentryOUT #NemiIN40 points in a half against a tanking team grow up @SacramentoKings@SacramentoKings your team is pretty bad. Losing by 13 and Portland doesn’t have their key starters@MarkJonesESPN @SacramentoKings @kayte_c What did I tell you?The story of tonight's first half is pretty much the story of Sacramento's season:

Tyrese Haliburton = Great
The Kings = Not so much

Sacramento shot 35% from the field and 15% from three-point range as they trail a Portland team that is without Dame, CJ and Norman Powell by 13.#Portland Trail Blazers - Sacramento Kings ★ #2º cuarto terminado: 53 - 40 ★ by: #SofaScoreI’ll probably be in my 40’s when the Sacramento #Kings clinch a playoff spot and when they do, it’s a fact I will cry like a little baby@NotHimNope @momoragan @Matt_Barnes22 @SacramentoKings @NBCSAuthentic Absolutely Best Dressed@SacramentoKings how are you this shitty?
