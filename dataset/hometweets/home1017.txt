#NBA #CryptoHoops #programmer #profitPhoenix Suns versus Los Angeles Lakers. Monday, March 14, at 9:00 AM, it’s a hero and underdog story in the court.

And all they need is 5 games? And they are 29-37 right now? Boy I give Lakers fans this, hope springs eternal.@Suns make sure our players see this 👀 https://t.co/4oUsNlC8VI@mnhopper1s @JKthoughts283 @Lakers @Suns Thanks @mnhopper1s &amp; @JKthoughts283 I believe the @NBATA AT of both @Lakers &amp; @Suns sits at the end of the bench closest to the scoring table. The only other non-players ON the bench are Head Coach &amp; 3 assistants. Variety of people sit behind the bench. We are in the "front row"After his 50 point night against the Wizards, LeBron heads to Phoenix on Sunday Night.

The Suns are 3-2 in their last 5 games without Chris Paul.

At 29-37, LA is currently in the 9th spot within the West.

Why would David say "black" chicken? 
Black is more related to original concept of phoenix.
Phoenix in mythology(not fantasy artwork) is described as a sun-bird flying in the sun regardless of time &amp; region.

That’s Sunday night. Only on ESPN.”@Suns Don't know how this is but I'm open to seeing what he's got. I trust James JonesThe #LakeShow will get run off the floor by the @Suns tomorrow night. What’s crazy is that in last year’s playoff game against the Suns, the Lakers were well on the way to winning that series.

1/I’ve never seen your games since this game 8/3/2020 @CP3 I really miss you.I hope I get to next season! Next time 🤟🏽🔥#Chrispaul @Suns https://t.co/RKnSirnUyD@kelsifer888 @TheEllenShow Right. I live and grew up in the Phoenix area and we have a latitude similar to LA. I remember doing the daylight savings as a kid in the 60s or 70s. We'd go to a drive-in theatre and the sun would be setting at 9:30P. It's a pretty dumb scheme at this latitude. AZ opted out.
