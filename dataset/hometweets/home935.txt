The question is can the DEFENSE match the offense. Trae Young is a top7 PG in the NBA, but this Hawks team must have a team mindset to lock in on D to stay in the play in mix #NBA #AtlantaHawks@ILoveMyADHD @AkibaXv @RonnieMathis2 @xoJayRenee Absolutely not. The Grizz were a play-in team last year. They're likely a top 3 seed this year. It's a win if they even win a playoff series imo. 

A young core with a budding superstar, and unless they go on an Atlanta Hawks type run, I don't see them getting past the WCSFs.@AnalyticsCapper C. 2021 Eastern Conference finalists, Atlanta Hawks, 29-32De'Andre Hunter Atlanta Hawks Panini America 2019-20 Panini
