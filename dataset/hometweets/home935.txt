He has also not missed a shot since the All-Star break.

https://t.co/4iQPQrHVugSomebody should probably file a missing persons report or BOLO or whatever for @DreHunter. #DoBetter #LetsGoHawks #AtlantaHawksCompare the 2021-22 Memphis Grizzlies to the 2009-10 Atlanta Hawks, it's a pretty fair and accurate comparison since the Hawks ended up as the 3rd seed in ‘10 (but got swept by Orlando 😔) and the Grizzlies had a 10 game winning streak.I will be live tweeting The Chicago Bulls vs. Atlanta hawks game tomorrow night at 7PM EST for a school assignment. #onusm2022 #NBA #basketballBOSTON -- Celtics coach Ime Udoka said after Boston's 107-98 victory over the Atlanta Hawks at TD Garden on Tuesday night that he is optimistic Jaylen Brown's right ankle sprain won't keep him out long term. https://t.co/r9XRlcammxGorgui Dieng shows why he is not in the Atlanta Hawks rotation https://t.co/H8Dug67ftEI bought my son a dope ass Atlanta Hawks jersey for his birthday. I don’t know ish about that team, but the Jersey dope and I can’t wait to dress him up in it 😂🤷🏾‍♀️Atlanta Hawks have the offense (scoring) to be a contender in this 2021-22 NBA season. The question is can the DEFENSE match the offense. Trae Young is a top7 PG in the NBA, but this Hawks team must have a team mindset to lock in on D to stay in the play in mix #NBA #AtlantaHawks@ILoveMyADHD @AkibaXv @RonnieMathis2 @xoJayRenee Absolutely not. The Grizz were a play-in team last year. They're likely a top 3 seed this year. It's a win if they even win a playoff series imo. 

A young core with a budding superstar, and unless they go on an Atlanta Hawks type run, I don't see them getting past the WCSFs.@AnalyticsCapper C. 2021 Eastern Conference finalists, Atlanta Hawks, 29-32De'Andre Hunter Atlanta Hawks Panini America 2019-20 Panini
