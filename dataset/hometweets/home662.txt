This trade was to save money@celtics They’re out for the season… so I don’t give a shit what his comments are cause they’re invalid until they play in a game! I’m sick of this Coachgo for a win @celticsLiterally just put ESPN on…

Greenberg: “Can the Boston Celtics win a NBA Championship with Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown?”

I’m. So. Tired.@celticsfuckyou @DavidClayFarme1 @celtics Then why did you go to a homophobic attack? What’s really in that head of yours? Are you ashamed of your true feelings?Coach Udoka comments on our acquisitions of Bol Bol and PJ Dozier and how they could potentially impact us down the line.

https://t.co/baRCfVQM28@celtics Fuck outta here with that man let them okay ball without that bs@MacKingdom10 @BuffaloSabres06 @celtics Who said that?@BolWrld @celtics He's financially a Celtic. He has to play a game to be officially a Celtic.@celtics @rob_williamsIII what kind of man stays home to take care and spend time with his newborn and doesn’t play?

Just do us all a favor and lay off the homophobia.@celticsfuckyou @DavidClayFarme1 @celtics That doesn’t  make sense. Calm down, talk a walk and come back more concise.@celtics I believe that this helps them to avoid the luxury tax. They save about $4.5 million. Both players are free agents at the end of the year.@Arsenalredskins @celtics Well, problem is not being gay, which is ok as everyone can have their preferrwd choice whatever they are attracted to. Dumb are the ones who seek attention about it as if they were special. So in that regard, I agree. It's nothing special. People try making it are cancerious@celtics When are you cutting him to save money 🙄🙄🙄13-GAME WED !
