Usuario: BsDentistry@upsahlmusic @Suns Heck yea good luck and have fun!!!For obvious reasons, nobody is talking about how the Suns just got back Torrey Craig. Smooth, lowkey chess move from James Jones and Monty. Put in some good minutes for Phoenix last year. Chemistry is huge manLike the Craig trade a lot to come in for Crowder in the second unit @SunsNEXT..

ERIC GORDON

You really started to develop your game, I myself enjoyed your time with Phoenix! #futureallstarphoenix suns have the best team chemistry in the NBA &amp; now Craig is back 🔥🔥Updated Suns rotation:

@TCraig_23Phoenix Suns Fun Fact Day 2:
(Making up for yesterday)

Of all the professional Arizona sports teams, the Suns are the only team to brand themselves as a Phoenix team!

It's funny how, except for Dave Pasch, the broadcasters for the Phoenix market teams hint at trades. Suns broadcasters were just gushing over Jalen Smith... I hope James Harden stays in Philly.

Trade on hold as both teams are trying to work a deal with @HoustonRockets to swap Westbrook for Wall and Christian Wood while Suns will be adding Eric Gordon. #WOJBOMBAlluding that a Cavs team presently just ONE GAME out of 1st place, in a wide-open East, has no shot to make playoff noise is hilarious.

Trade Ayton if you aren’t gonna extend him, get you a playmaker. Enough with the role players.Our biggest weakness has been lack of depth.  We saw it again the @Suns , they can go 9 deep and still get production.  So how can we make a 3 for 1 trade?  Our best defender and best 3 point shooter plus that bum all star?

Lakers has the biggest fanbase in the world (basketball). Media is all for rating and money. Btw, you forgot about the LeBron factor.

Memphis has been getting tons of coverage lately, yet Memphis is 1/4 the size of the Phoenix market, and Phoenix is a better team and has two stars, not one.@Jumpshot8 @NBA @Suns @Bucks Sounds good! Appreciate all the love and attention you give the sun's. Us fans appreciate and value you❤️@BrynnTannehill @bretseeley @Espo @Jumpshot8 @Lakers @Suns @undisputed @SuperBowl self fulfilling prophecy.

suns get no coverage - so how would a player be voted as a starter? any other team this good would have a top 3 MVP candidate. No doubt CP3 and/or Book would be up there…if they got the coverage they deserve.

Also, Booker absolutely is unstoppable.@JustinCreed3 @eriko_esteban @BrynnTannehill @Espo @Jumpshot8 @Lakers @Suns @undisputed @SuperBowl Booker is just as popular as Nash was and CP3 is definitely a bigger star than Nash ever was. And I grew up idolizing Nash as a kid.@SunsJAM @Suns Uhhh, can I vote for both! Idk which to pick..lol shamet! Shamet! Shamet!!!@Jumpshot8 @VGandChill @Lakers @Suns @undisputed @SuperBowl EJ…with all due respect, we all know history. I grew up in PHX, I’m as old as the franchise (i remember screaming at you to stop dribbling and just shoot back in ‘88 …22pts on 50% off the bench!) no one outside of PHX believes until it happens…Aww bron Bron, what wrong? @Lakers  the @suns keep winning?!!

Let that sink in.

What is that number going to be if he stays and plays until he is 35+?

This might be an unbreakable record.

Hey @suns fans let’s get ready for tomorrow against the @Bucks  by having a glass of wine and enjoying some Jazz.  What  do you think?@TanaHughes @ArizonaDOT For people who don’t understand. Last year for basketball Phoenix Suns were in the Finals. They needed to win 4 games to win the Championship but unfortunately lost to the Bucks (Milwaukee Bucks) and they won the Championship 4 - 2. Suns almost won the championship last year.@CollinYourbs @Suns I don't quite understand all the technicalities. But I know what I see. Holy shit that was beautiful.So new prediction.. @suns will be the 2022 NBA Finals champions and @CP3 and @DevinBook will get their first ring this year.Congrats to @Suns, the only serious team rn@Jumpshot8 @Lakers @Suns @undisputed @SuperBowl They’re the Rodney Dangerfield of@the NBA. “I tell you I get no respect”@PaulaProgressiv @Suns I like that they have real time technical scoring on the screen now@CollinYourbs @Suns It was fucking incredible!!!@warriors @Suns clapping this team in 4......wtf was that@DidTheWarriorsW And I was suppose to believe we’re better than the @suns lmfao siighFINAL: Defensive breakdowns, turnovers, and Utah's offensive firepower results in a Golden State Warriors loss over the Utah Jazz, 111-85, Dubs' worst loss of the season. Record is now at 41-14, still second in the Western Conference, 3.5 games behind the Phoenix Suns (44-10).@PaulaProgressiv @Suns That was exciting.Congrats to @utahjazz ending the @warriors win streak.. making me eat my words they’re definitely not gonna be champions this year.. @suns looking way better@angelinams112 I have to cancel many things next week too because I coming to Phoenix to see the Suns. I am 9400 km away (I live in France) and had to save money for 7 years to afford that upcoming trip.
