@nbatopshot is here, @NFLALLDAY is in closed beta, and @UFC_Dapper is coming (amongst others.)I’m not an analytics guy, but I’m a huge fan of the @Raptors 
-Seems clear to me that #FredVanVleet is an #NBAAllStar 
-But I’d like to also note that @Klow7 is at the top of that list. Fred is beyond amazing, but can we also get a shout-out for mentorship?
#WeTheNorth https://t.co/TzBOpe7L2c@gosportsgo6 @WestSS_101 @heyhalima @Raptors Or also, maybe they realllllly just wanted Precious.  They've proven to be a great scouting and development front office and Precious is only 21 and still raw.  Never know.  24 year old Precious might be good.  Happened for Fred and Pascal.@20_awill @Raptors @Sportsnet Hope you’re feeling better Alvin.  Hope to hear you calling games soon.@Raptors @gtrentjr @gtrentjr gets my vote for all-star game show the NBA how to put the boots to their butts in a game you need another 40pt game to shut the haters💪@gosportsgo6 @WestSS_101 @heyhalima @Raptors You're right, they didn't have to, and owed him nothing.  My guess is that the Casey and Demar departures were ugly and they wanted to make sure they did right by Kyle.  Maybe they think that helps with future players. I dunno.@SlowWinStudios @CMcElhinney @TheJurassicPack @Raptors Don't know what I'm doing but I'll sign up because of the tag 👊@20_awill @Raptors @Sportsnet Stay safe. We will miss you.

Vote for Fred!@DJXS @WestSS_101 @heyhalima @Raptors Why? Raptors owed him nothing that’s what the money was.

7 - Toronto Raptors -7 over LA ClippersFave TS memories of 2021 are:
- Signing up on May 5th thanks to my friend @CMcElhinney
- Joining @TheJurassicPack 
- Completing the @Raptors full team set

#NBATopShotThis https://t.co/ahbtvpGxHYToronto Raptors -7 (-110)@Raptors @FredVanVleet Sorry but I think ditching All Star, so that you can be healthy is much more important at this point. Let the others play All star.@20_awill @Raptors @Sportsnet Been wondering where you’re at! Rest up and get off the injury report, we might need ya on a 10 day!@randykfox @LarryCainCanoe @WestSS_101 @heyhalima @Raptors @JClarkNBCS Who gives a shit where Kyle wanted to go.

Not sure what their rationale was. Get over it.  I’ll take happily take most of the moves they make and forgive the odd mistake knowing that they know more than me, and I’d likely have taken Suggs over Scottie.  And they won us a chip.@evyosborne @Raptors @FredVanVleet Hahaha wow whats your problem@canhowie @Raptors The official Real Estate agent of the Raptors?@20_awill @Raptors @Sportsnet Wishing you a speedy recovery ❤️‍🩹@set921 @Raptors @FredVanVleet Ya but they thought playing with no fans was over last year. Now they got to do it again and the Raptors fans are the best in the league and gives the Raptors one of the best home court advantages in the NBA. So not having them must suck.@TorontoDame @chicagobulls @Raptors this man needs some recognition@Sportnews365247 @Raptors @FredVanVleet They're playing a sport they love for millions of dollars  I don't feel sorry for them at all, lol.Champagnie is cleared and available.

If he wanted to go to Miami to play with Butler Raps really didn’t have much choice.  So if Kyle didn’t want to go to Philly that deal was never gonna happen.

Sophomore season, Barrett and the Knicks had to play Raptors in Tampa.

This is a divisional rival Raptors that normally they visit twice a season. Knicks-Raptors play on Sunday without fans.Another casualty of #COVID, that @Raptors fans can’t show the love to Serge Ibaka for all the great contributions he made to the Toronto community.

I had love for Raptors since i was a teenager, I just wasn't into sports . Being a Toronto team, they represented my city. And then in 2019 things got wild so I actually fell in love with basketball because of it. And have been dedicated since. Even when they suck.FINALLY!!!

https://t.co/PVCvZvO6H2@Raptors What about non-member tickets from the postponed December 16 game? Can’t get a refund but we know it’s not happening. Give me my money back 😒Reminder: the Toronto Raptors are champions witching 5 years.@jaypoq @habsfan43 @Raptors It is Christmas holidays. This was dropped on them too and they will have to figure out what the best approach for them is to provide refunds, it is not as simple as refunds to everyone as season ticket holders, box holders etc have an ongoing account with MLSE. Many moving parts@Jambabox99 @Raptors Sounds about right. Cancelling a ticket is simple, boom your ticket is cancelled. Arranging 22000 refunds takes a bit more time, especially over a holiday week like Christmas where a good chunk of the financial staff that would handle organizing and distribution of funds are off.@jaypoq @Raptors That is going to be rescheduled at the end of the year likely. So your ticket will be the same ticket then. They are not going to go through reselling all the tickets for the game.Joel Embiid had himself another big game as the Philadelphia 76ers were able to knock off the Toronto Raptors.  https://t.co/w7S4X3GIcnOntario shrinks venue sizes to 1000.

#GetBoostedYo @Raptors and @Ticketmaster, what about people who paid for tix to the Bulls game that got postponed? Weeks have passed and we haven't heard peep about a refund. The postponement wasn't your fault but you still have to run our $ back please and thank you.@Raptors So happy to see familiar faces they look healthy🤩. I'm not happy no fans in Scotiabank area for the next 3weeks 😔@kelwright KJ - I wish you cover Raptors!!! as it only make sense you being from Toronto.A bed time story I told me daughter. 

Once upon a time there was a #NBAAllStar named #FredVanVleet 

The end.

She loved it and asked for you all to tell it to your TL.

They're finally getting healthy and their hope is that Ibaka's Toronto homecoming happens to coincide with their own resurgence: https://t.co/z06dURWxET https://t.co/MhKlFI19cc@Raptors This is so weirdly worded. What does this mean for people who have tickets up games at the start of January? First 1000 to show up get in? No one gets in at all?@Raptors Need to be refunded for the original tickets I bought for January 9th still…

We then re bought for January 9th vs Pelicans when it went down to 50% capacity. 

When we will receive those refunds? Thanks@Raptors Is this game still being aired on tv or not tomorrow raptors I watching nba streams New Year’s Eve and nhl online@Raptors How about the game vs the bulls on the 16th cancel those tickets too and offer a refund. Don’t keep our money hostage@Raptors Can’t wait to see the virus go away and never return because of this 👍@Raptors @pskills43 No all stars unless the team is over 500.@Raptors hey since the game on the 16th vs the bulls got postponed when will it be played? Why not just cancel and have everyone get their money back. Kinda annoying having your money held hostage. I agreed to see the game on the 16th not any other day.All tickets for Fridays’s game against the Los Angeles Clippers have been cancelled. For Members and Suiteholders your money will stay in your account as credit for future use. All other ticket purchasers will receive a refund in 30 days.@Raptors @OAnunoby -“put you on scarves put you on scarves put you on scarves”
