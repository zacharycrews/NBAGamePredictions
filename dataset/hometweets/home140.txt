Johnson (2018 PIT, La Salle) had team-highs of 26 points and 9 rebounds for the Lakeland Magic (NBA G League) in a loss to Texas Legends. Johnson has NBA experience with Orlando, Atlanta and Sacramento. 
@LaSalle_MBB30 years ago today Earvin Magic Johnson shocked the world with his announcement that he would have to retire immediately from the Lakers due to contracting the HIV virus. Johnson returned three months later to win the NBA All-Star Game MVP in Orlando. #Lakers #LakersNation https://t.co/3Obc9zkWfeSports are not very fun right now @Avalanche @Chiefs @SouthernMissFB @OrlandoMagic@OrlandoMagic all of these but not one for @The_ColeAnthony  ???? https://t.co/BYxCjmd2aYThe Magic finally get a much needed break after tonight’s game with only two games on the schedule and both being played at home. 

The Magic have played 11 games in 19 days so far (including tonight). 

They gotta be TIRED. 

#MagicTogether #OrlandoMagicSlick wanna slide down to Orlando n catch this Jazz magic game real quick@Dan_Savage @OrlandoMagic The Celtics intentionally ground the pace into a low score game...hence the low DRTG. The Magic still gave up a 31pt quarter to BOS's 20th ranked offense.

Injuries to Russell/Beverly forced T-Wolves (4th worst offense in NBA) to use a 3d string PG for the majority of the game.@Dan_Savage @OrlandoMagic There should probably be some context added to that November defensive rank for the Magic's 3 November games:

vs SAS:  The Spurs have a very lackluster offense (18th in NBA).  Despite that, the Magic's defense gave up two 30pt quarters to them.

(cont.)EricPMusselman: Learned so much from @DocRivers as an assistant coach on his first staff with the @OrlandoMagic! Coach Rivers won @NBA Coach of the Year that season and was lucky enough to be a part of his first time out ever as a head coach. #TookGoodNo… https://t.co/gJziDyggNP#NBAMagicPolls: Over or Under 15,500 Fans show up to The AC Tonight.

I would expect a better Orlando showing than Friday.From the Magic Kingdom to magical spa treatments, Orlando sparkles with the promise of adventure.

https://t.co/yIf8LM88Ba@Dan_Savage @OrlandoMagic I grew up In Syracuse NY where the Syracuse Nats played ( Now the 76 Sixers) . I never remember players like Shayes, Greer, Costello, Lloyd missing games as  players do today. When star George Yardley was traded to the Nats he had a broken arm in a cast...and still played.@Mrbiggiesmallz @BenSimmons25 @MetroEsportsUS I was just looking at Fultz's season. He's shooting about 40% from the field. If the Magic would be willing to do that trade, the Sixers should take it. Ben really would love Orlando too. Tons of whores and STD's and they don't care if you can make a foul shot.@_justmy_opinion Been saying that for years. He would run up and down the court like a deer during those early Magic days.  Was strong and slender and so agile. Still can’t believe Orlando didn’t do everything in their power to retain him in the summer of 96🎙New Pod: Early Season Takeaways🎙
