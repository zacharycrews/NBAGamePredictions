You got waxed by a team that had a 15 game losing streak to have your own 14 game winning streak.

#NFL #NBA https://t.co/zVqGq6LxTJDidn't expect a whole lot from the Detroit Pistons but never thought they'd be this bad. They've definitely regressed. Definitely an indictment on HC Dwane Casey. Thought he was a good HC but maybe not #NBA@DetroitRedWings @DetroitPistons Pretty cool what these guys can do with putting the new ice in so quick@Garrett_NJD30 It‚Äôs funny right after that goal the Detroit commentators said they had a Pistons game this afternoon and they JUST got the boards done.

üëã, @DetroitPistons. https://t.co/5w9LiayqpGThis might actually be the biggest problem with the Detroit Pistons. Stop drafting shy and reserved players obsessed with anime lol. There is 0 swag or irrational confidence - which you need. Troy Weaver should speak to the media at the very least. His team are 4-24 and sliding. https://t.co/WfpWvxOYK2@DetroitPistons @LukaG_55 @BELFORGroup @CadeCunningham_ Perhaps Dwane Casey should play @LukaG_55 more?@WetroitWistons @TheMMAenjoyer @MobHoops @JalenRockets @DetroitPistons @SaddiqBey @CadeCunningham_ @Dreamville_33 I didn‚Äôt change anything. Scoring 21 points on 19 shot attempts is inefficient. It‚Äôs not about his 8 for 19 shooting. I never said that. Not once did I mention his 8 made shots.@Lakers are so soft and scary. That‚Äôs why Suns Detroit Pistons Timberwolves all talking shit to them and doing antics. Nobody fears the brand, teams know they all flopping and no manhood. They some punks and front runners.
