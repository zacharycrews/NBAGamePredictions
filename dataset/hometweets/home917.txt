https://t.co/sYJycQW3lH@MiamiHEAT @SHAQ @DwyaneWade @KingJames I hope to see you in person @KingJames 🙏🙏🙏🙏@Chalsa01 Yeah, you could’ve shaved a good 15-20 minutes off. I would’ve shot more of the movie in Miami, because most of it wasn’t, plus the pacing could’ve been more in a noir style and it wouldn’t have as they say “insisted upon itself” as much. Think White Heat in terms of pace.Friendly reminder that he’s won 2 titles since leaving the Miami Heat https://t.co/llsj1P9xBFLmao now compare the Big 3 Celtics to the Big 3 Miami Heat! 😂😂😂😂😂 https://t.co/Q1Qxtrzmf1Vince Vaughn, 51, strips down to his swim trunks to beat the heat in Miami

Feb 28, 2022 - Miami Heat -4.5@SynergySST @Suns @warriors @cavs @celtics @MiamiHEAT @dallasmavs @utahjazz @Bucks IT IS NOT LE BON LOGO !!@bammy_de @TheHerd @ColinCowherd I know, when the year first started, everyone was convinced Miami was a lottery team, now everyone wants the Heat to trade their best assets to help the Lakers? Just pathetic 🤣🤣🤣@bobonglegend @MiamiHEAT @HeatvsHaters Heat in 4@MajesticResists @JimmyButler @MiamiHEAT Good advice from the O.G.  

😏🍻Miami heat and stupid lol https://t.co/akyukPdYj6@QuantChild @PhilaRoll21 @undisputed @jasonrmcintyre Cuz we don’t have an official backup center and the heat aren’t anything special even if u guys are CURRENTLY leading the conference there’s a very good chance that the sixers beat Miami here in a few days and the sixers have enough fire power to overcome them and take the 1 spotCan’t wait!😤 Let’s go @MiamiHEAT 🔥 https://t.co/rJLjEOsMeH@JAYOakaTOOTS @JimmyButler @MiamiHEAT Herd is nonstop incoherent gibberish!

Bam Adebayo O10.5 Rebounds @ 2.15 ($100)

Bulls are awful at rebounding at the moment, and Adebayo should feast. He cleared this number in 7 out of the L10 matches.

The hypocrisy is undeniable@1Vetinari @Jay91036450 @ESPNNBA @stephenasmith As a Cavs fan, I couldn’t stand Miami Heat LeBron. The reason? Because he was so damn good and he moved away from my team. And I love LeBron to this day because he came back and did what no other athlete has done since Jim Brown. Bring a championship to Cleveland. 🤷🏼‍♂️@xRevva Bucks are frauds.

Signing Westbrick hurt them a lot too idk who’s taking that contract this summer.@SwaggyHeat @MiamiHEAT the offense from when we got him does revolve around him. it’s sucha sad scene.🏀 NBA MULTI 🏀
