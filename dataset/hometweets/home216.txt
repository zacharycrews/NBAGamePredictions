Heat have there first game at home in 5 games where they are 4-1 ATS. Pelicans come in at 2-6 away from home ATS. Butler is back for the heat who had a 2-3 road trip and I expect them to put clean up the Pels.

I was at the game and he lead the Heat to victory, scoring over 35 points.Remember when I told you there was dang near just as many Miami Heat fans as Brooklyn fans when I went? I wouldn’t be surprised if half the arena was going for the warriors.

Lots of egos to manage. Lots of playing styles to adjust. I still dont think Frank Vogel the most suited but Lakers are still very much title contenders if they can stay healthy because they will figure it.@MiamiHEAT Can I get a screen print of the Jokic affair on a Heat T?Miami Heat leading scorers:

THAT PART 👆@SAFARI_BLACK Yup. It’s all about business maneuvering, these arenas change their names all the time, soon as them contracts expire. The Miami Heat also just renamed their arena after the popular crypto exchange, FTX.@FTX_Official @TomBrady @giseleofficial @StephenCurry30 @Trevorlawrencee @MLB @kevinolearytv @LCSOfficial @MiamiHEAT @riotgames @TSM It's literally the only exchange that when you win - you still lose.

I’m a eagles super fan I have history encyclopedias and signed gear and everything

But with the 76ers I was never grabbed as a kid, I was so much intrigued with Vince carter and shaq 

Once shaq went to Miami and I saw d wade…I become a Heat liferThe Miami Heat had their arena name changed from American Airlines Arena to FTX arena . Named after another crypto platform for 135 mill where Staples Is changing to https://t.co/WcoVTwsgPp for about 700 mill@coinmaverick @Lakers @MiamiHEAT @FTXArena @gainzxbt Double fisted LIVE ON TV?!?!!

@heartwood__RIP Staples Center. Hello “Crypto .Com Arena”

At a reported $700 million for the naming rights, it’s one of the biggest naming deals in sports history

It also makes the $135 million that @SBF_FTX paid to get the Miami Heat arena naming rights look like a steal https://t.co/Ttru8D60c6@Marc0Island I’m trying to decide that or the Miami Heat game. I think I have to go to the movie man. That bih is going to be packed to the brim like End game was- @FTX_Official &amp; @MiamiHEAT naming rights deal

The NBA continues to run circles around the NFL in terms of growth, adoption and culture. https://t.co/KiX77ShrsXThey're renaming the Lakers Center in LA to https://t.co/2txtc6OVhP Arena. They paid $700M for 20 years of naming rights, which is one of the biggest deal ever. This is also the second cryptocurrency company to have a sports arena. FTX paid $135M to rename the Miami Heat’s arena.@MiamiHEAT @kwambui @O_Y_U_GI we did it first... Don't get too excited please 😌can't wait for the 2022 NBA finals

If  Tua has just ten fans, I am one of them. If Tua only has one fan, I am that one fan. If Tua has no fans, that means I am no longer in this world. If the world is against Tua, I am against this world.@ChefTrillie_ @MiamiHEAT @BabatundeJr21 My boy became a KZ stan@ChefTrillie_ @MiamiHEAT @BabatundeJr21 Respect@symmering I'd think he'll stay at UM until at least Jett and Jace are graduated or gone, so 3-4 more years minimum imo, after that who knows. 

He would obviously be in no rush to jump at the first offer, maybe he would hold out for the Miami Heat job?@MiamiHEAT @BabatundeJr21 If KZ has a million fans, I am one of them. If  KZ has just ten fans, I am one of them. If KZ only has one fan, I am that one fan. If KZ has no fans, that means I am no longer in this world. If the world is against KZ, I am against this world.@MiamiHEAT You LOVE to see it https://t.co/fQu1HHjz0wThis moment when @DwyaneWade Came back to @MiamiHEAT  was the greatest.
