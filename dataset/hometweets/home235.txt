#arbitrage #bettingtwitter #bettingpicks #sportsbets #freepicks #freemoney #mlbNot his own 2P scoring, mind you.

What team do you think leads the NBA in FG% inside 10 feet? The Utah Jazz, perhaps, with their elite spacing around the Stifle Tower? The Denver Nuggets with Jokic and his absurd interior scoring? Nope.The Denver Nuggets, despite many ups-and-downs to begin the year, are 9-6 so to encapsulate the season so far, I put together 15 takeaways from the Nuggets first 15 games of the season.
