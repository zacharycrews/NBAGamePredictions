I want ayton FA but doubt we get him@jackcuz5 @DetroitPistons yeah that’s kinda where i’m at as of right now too, i really like jabri cause he’s more NBA ready but chet could be very good if he can put on that NBA weight on him fastCould you imagine if Cavs fucked up the 2004 draft and the Pistons got Lebron?

I can’t stand any team left in the playoffs and I love my Cavs.The Detroit Pistons have lowkey been terrible at drafting the past 35 years.

The only years they did really well were 1994 and 2012.

They have reached and missed a lot.@BradDaugherty43 @cavs @DetroitPistons Exactly go cavs@niranjangfx @hamidoudiallo @CadeCunningham_ @DetroitPistons @AshtonDaTrainer good looks man 😮‍💨@niranjangfx @hamidoudiallo @CadeCunningham_ @DetroitPistons @AshtonDaTrainer Holy WIt is time for the Detroit Pistons to put Luka Garza into the starting lineup. He produces what Isaiah Stewart does, but only plays half the time. The Pistons should let last year's NCAA Player of the Year get his Bill Laimbeer on.💯

Detroit was great and beat down MJ but he kept working. When he got a team he beat them &amp; then owned the nba. pistons showed no class when the bulls beat them. No one liked Isiah.
