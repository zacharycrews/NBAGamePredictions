#RapsIn7

https://t.co/ipyiQ6vC42@BlueJays @Raptors 2 runs in last two games, and Boston matched you 14 for 14 over 4 games, not exactly worth bragging about. Today was a pathetic game and yeatstday was disgusting too.@SmartAndis0405 @Raptors Scotiabank Arena is a fortress, we can do it.. if anyone can then its RaptorsLanded in Toronto @ 4:13 PM on an @airtransat flight from #Mexico and STILL on the tarmac yo… this is killing us 😭

At least I have a few things to look forward to whenever we finally get home:
- @Raptors game
- @GutterCatGang bird clone 
- @RTFKTstudios #MNLTH reveal (maybe)Why do I feel the Sixers are going to win tonight? Please force a game 7 @Raptors@BillV15472442 @Raptors It won’t hopefully 🙌@Raptors @hudsonsbay Weak ass fits for a weak ass teamExcited for Game 6, we got this. Haven't been to a Raptors game since Chris Bosh was still on the team lol. Let's Go @Raptors #NBAPlayoffs #WeTheNorth https://t.co/L77rawfaq8@deejdotwav @Raptors Yo chill 🦖If the @Raptors win tonight they will be the first team in NBA history to overcome a 3-0 playoff deficit to advance. No way the 76ers lose tonight and win in Game 7, tonight is a must win game for Philly!

Having said this, I still believe the @sixers get the job done tonight. https://t.co/IUSiJNNDAqGo Raps!!! #WeTheNorth #Game6  we are game ready! @Raptors @LeoRautins @HelloooJack @TSN_Sports https://t.co/e3wFKnPwaICome on @Raptors@JLew1050 He should rest.

Plus you can see the raps know they can beat them.@S_Nouman_Ashraf @Raptors I gotta bust out my jersey for good mojo.@Amit_Mann That is because the corporates keep handing out the tickets to the brokers and vendors keep handing it out to some random people at the companies to keep the contracts alive. 
They don’t even have any interest in

Please and ty.@CavsFanLand7 @NBA @Raptors When starting 5 is all playing. It goes Siakam, VanVleet, OG/Gary Trent Jr then Scottie.  OG lead the team in scoring first month and then GTJ had a crazy string of 30 point games.  Scottie gets most of his points off rebounds@DerrickDanqua20 @NBATV @sixers @Raptors FunnyThe Toronto Raptors were down 3-0 against the 76ers. Tonight, they have the chance to tie the series at 3-3.

Like the Raptors w/ VanVleet and Siakam. Hence more opportunity for Mobley in that situation than SB.  Honestly I thought it was gonna be co-rookie of the year until the last few weeks of the season. Barnes had the edge 100%Class also took advantage of our @Raptors spirit day. 

Lots of red and white out here at the Lakehouse to support the team tonight!

#WeTheNorth #Toronto https://t.co/AIB44I1kn1@CavsFanLand7 @NBA @Raptors I don't think you know what "robbed" means. I wouldn't say he was robbed of the ROTY cuz it legitimately could've gone to either one. Both had an almost even amount of votes and both were deserving to win it. Just cuz Scottie won doesn't mean Mobley was robbed of itYo, @Lesdoggg would be the perfect casting for Joel Embiid for inevitable ESPN doc about how they blew a 3-0 lead to the @Raptors 🤣

Why can't y'all just accept that both players are generational talent without having to cry about Scottie winning ROTY??@GamblingG0D Not trolling but I do not trust this team. Sixers have no bench Joel is sobbing about his thumb. Harden just stumbles down the lane passes or looks for the fouls. They should have swept Toronto but they opened the door for them instead.

#WeTheNorth | #Sixers | #Embiid | https://t.co/CUgddUCShz@hughwburrill @Raptors @sixers My advice? #YouDoYouApril 28, 1975: NBA player Martin Lewis is born in Liberal, Kan. The Liberal HS grad played parts of 2 seasons with the Toronto Raptors.@rapsmuse_nba @Raptors Doc rivers try not to blow a lead challenge (impossible)Is it ok if I just watch tonight's @Raptors @sixers Game 6 purely for the excitement of it? Or do I have to have "action" on a half dozen betting sites? Just wondering. 🤔@CityofBitchhogs @kno_nuffin @TaylorGang820 @overtime @Bucks @celtics Sixers are on the ropes because the Raptors have the momentum going into tonight's game and if there's a Game 7 in Philly, Toronto will be sitting pretty in the driver's seat despite being on the road@Radio_Brent @BlueJays @Raptors See ya there pal.

It's the first thing I was eyeing last night after the late night game. Why pay the juice for a small line and not + money with the ML?

Also, I know you have 6ers in 7 before this series started. If Toronto wins tonight are you siding with the 6ers for G7?@G_Marie215 @sixers @NBCSPhilly @NBATV @975TheFanatic @Raptors @betPARX @Ticketmaster All Philly sports fans psyches depend on it 🤣😬The Toronto Raptors lost the first three games of their series with the Philadelphia 76ers, but now have a chance to even the series tonight at home. Former Indiana Hoosier OG Anunoby has outscored James Harden this series as Toronto eyes a comeback. #iubb https://t.co/EHbPtq5oNj@sixers @NBCSPhilly @NBATV @975TheFanatic @Raptors @betPARX @Ticketmaster Good Luck tonight Philly fans, but not too much.

You can have him.
No Canadian seems to have the guts to remove their very own dictator. https://t.co/JsEvUpTutSBad News: Kennedy reffed Gm 1 with a 9-2 foul (dis)advantage. Raps are 3-5 with him.

Good News: Raps are 8-2 when Zarba or Blair are referees. Among those who have reffed at least 3 Raptors games, Toronto has the highest point differential (+14.8) with Blair (5-1 overall) https://t.co/2DjGqv3qfWKind of a big game up in Toronto tonight. 

The #Sixers don’t want to come home for a Game 7. The #Raptors want to crush our hopes and dreams in our house again should they win tonight. 

Can the Sixers (-1.5) pull it off tonight?

It's going to be a great day, have a great one and please be kind ☕️⚾️🏀☀️@raptors606 @Raptors  not the black shirts :/ we need colourGood morning everyone, especially the @Raptors 🥳Can the @sixers end the series tonight? #NBAPlayoffs #nba #76ers #PhilaUnite #basketball #WeTheNorth @Raptors may have something to say about that though. #NBA75 #web3 #web3community #art #artist #digitalart #digital #metaverse@jjoel_io @highasJR @WorldWideWob So Toronto is doing the exact same thing arent they? People love to make excuses. Raptors play the entire season doing international travel. Does that make them the best team in the league even though they are 5th seed? Stupid logicThere’s absolutely only ONE team to bet WITH tonight… RAPTORS!! Take the Raptors ML and/or spread. @Raptors @stoolpresidente @elio82 @BarstoolBigCat @theScoreBet@NBCSPhilly Let's go @Raptors! Doc already rehearsing his excuses for his post game 7 press conference when has to explain how they blew a 3-0 lead.  Embiid had an ouchie, Harden wasn't integrated into the team, Matisse wasn't vaccinated, etc....

#WeTheNorth #TORvsPHI https://t.co/eL911saOtiHi, for my birthday I would like a raps win tonight! Thanks! @Raptors #WeTheNorthHarden gotta do what he gotta do and take control.

To view this bet or copy it https://t.co/YiOVvt4gde https://t.co/pCnX1nferf@MikeFOX29 @AlexHolleyFOX29    Hate to be a pessimist, but @Raptors have all the momentum, and we have no clue how @JHarden13 is going to show up or not.  Game 7 in Philly.  @SueSerioFox29 @BobKellyFOX29 @FOX29philly #fox29goodday #gooddayphiladelphia #fox29To think that if Precious had made just one of those two free throws during regular time in @Raptors game #2, or OG hit both of his, we’d be the ones that were up 3-2 and looking to clinch on home court tonight. 

Such a game of opportunities. #rtz #NBAPlayoffsToronto Raptors - Philadelphia 76ers

Now they must pay for what they have done in the name of Jesus Christ.

Never, ever, count them out.

Go Raptors! 🏀now that my beloved chicago bulls are eliminated, i will be hopping on the toronto raptors bandwagon and the miami heat bandwagonI want the @Raptors to be confident, but not cocky. They're capable of making NBA history this week, but they shouldn't assume game 6 would be easy. #WeTheNorth@WalderSports 15 yrs ago, if someone asked me which was more likely for the Raptors, I’d say 0-3 comeback. 

Like 4thQ NFL comeback records, you have to be a bit shit to qualify. 

Championships will be rare for Toronto &amp; only remembered for excellence. Statues will be erected. #WeTheNorth@SlashingSand @NBAxNFT @FredVanVleet @NBA @Raptors @YoungSaint2330 what did you get@DebiasioNicolas @MLSEPR @ScotiabankArena @Raptors Ya I'm not sure how they determine the actual "capacity limit" number but I'd assume showing up without a QR code is very risky. no idea@Raptors And now the raptors are the team I’m cheering for now that the bulls are out. GO RAPTORSSSSSS@raweezzyy The audacity of some people to tweet under fake accounts when the Raptors are still down 3-2.

As a loyal bulls fan since 1548, I am APPALLED at the lack of drive, passion, and work ethic from this team. I will NO LONGER be cheering for this washed-up poverty franchise.

Come Sunday they’ll tells fans that it’s a deposit on 2022-23 tix for home games against the Kings and Thunder@NBAonTNT Am not a Milwaukee Bucks fan. However, how can you not cheer for Giannis to hopefully win back/back Champions. Dude is a gentleman, Makes his team better &amp; is humble beyond belief. Love my @Raptors but cheering for Giannis too.The original Toronto Raptors logo is still the sickest shit to me. Always has been.@elonmusk No Elon, what we truly need in this world is for the Toronto Raptors to upset the  Philadelphia 76ers.@DrJeffRatliff Agreed! There is still hope for my @Raptors@Kidnxtd8r It means that players that play for the raptors need to be fully vaxxed to be playing, just like how Philly players need to be fully vaxxed to play in Toronto@retroblockchain @Raptors @NBAxNFT I got Paschall…you win@dangordonTO @Raptors Thank you 😀@YYZemily @Raptors @superfan_nav Thank you! He saw the Timelapse video and shared it! 😀 but 🤷🏻‍♀️I don’t know if he saw this one.Mrs. Hewit's Gr1 class participated in a meet with Rapter's Superfan @superfan_nav. Nav spoke w/ students across @HaltonDSB about standing up 4 others, working together as team/classmates, acceptance, and of course @Raptors🏀 basketball! #ImWithSuperfanNav #SuperfanDocWorkshop https://t.co/8fYZwNUyHi@SamanthaWojArt @Raptors That's super, Samantha! You're so talented. I'm still in awe that you can do this with a basketball! Did @superfan_nav see it? #WeTheNorthTrue or false: The Toronto Raptors POTENTIALLY (and I can’t stress this enough because there’s work to be done) being the first team to win a series down 3-0 would be on equal footing with the 2019 NBA championship.@Embiid4MVP No need to worry about playing Miami or Boston #WeTheNorth @Raptors@retroblockchain @Raptors @NBAxNFT Awesome! Pretty happy I sold last week. Turned out to be Day’ron Sharpe. If you don’t know who that is. That’s okay…I didn’t either.@WindhorstESPN you do an entire podcast about young players in the playoffs and don’t talk about the @raptors at all, other than to compare guys to young Raps guys hoping that’s their upside? The way American media covers the Raptors is astounding@KLChouinard And you will be a Toronto Raptor.@retroblockchain @Raptors @NBAxNFT Clicked somewhere else and finally found the whole collection 🤷🏻‍♂️@KDTrey5 Yo @KDTrey5..fuk the hater!!

Can’t seem to search them…seems to be like 17 NFTs which can’t be right but my filters are cleared and I seem to be on their page 🤷🏻‍♂️Magic Johnson shares his love for the city of Toronto, the Raptors | The... https://t.co/hBIOSZekbn via @YouTube@MegaMohsi Totally lmao. I am rooting for Toronto solely for the reason that I want to see true chaos in Philly. I get Embiid is hurt but I mean… Barnes and FVV are banged up for the Raptors. The fall out of them losing this series would be epic.We getting to him! @Raptors fans please continue to give Glen shit about his shit coaching abilities! #docrivers #TORvsPHI #raptors #stressed https://t.co/3erzn9aMHg@JustEsBaraheni @Raptors Not that the Raps need extra motivation, but if  this isn't bulletin board material I don't know what is.What's #Best on https://t.co/VfZu3jgOen ?
