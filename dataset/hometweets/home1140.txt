Tonight's Blazers Draft Stock Matchups

Pacers over Nuggets in Indy
Kings over Rockets in Houston
Spurs over Memphis in Texas

Have a great evening #RipCity and @tcbbiggsJalen Green's last 26 games:

18.7 PTS
39% 3PT
3.2 AST
1.7 TOV 

Green won't win Rookie of the Year but his shooting, athleticism, and constantly improving feel give him the upside to be the best player in the 2022 draft class.

That's the one to watch out for. We don't want to finish behind them and outside the worst-3 teams who get the best lotter odds.
 Some fans say finishing with the worst record is hugely important so that they can draft no later than 5th.Today's NBA Picks: 8:00 PM ET - Sacramento Kings vs. Houston Rockets - 28 PICKS AVAILABLE: https://t.co/8d5Vm8hymh #nba@rocktredblood @MorpheusDeZion @wash77033 @d2derrick @alanshow @SammyDpsi @SportsDean @abbyeddymom @cdhthegreat @IamWendums @HoustonRockets @alperennsengun The 'worst' the Rockets could finish is with 26 wins, which would be sixth in the tankathon race. So, in the worst-worst case scenario where 3 teams with better records win the lottery the Rockets would slide to picking 9th.New Official Video from #TUDNHouston and @_cesarprocel!  #NBA #SkillsChallenge #NocheLatina #Houston #Rockets #IAlmostHadHim 😬

Afterwards, we headed to the Kemah Boardwalk to enjoy lunch with a beautiful view. https://t.co/EEtlyPbqdnThe first game preview going up is the one I think is most key to the slate today: the Rockets and Kings going at it down in Houston with depleted rosters.

They need to improve their interior defense, clearly. Holmgren is my top draft wish. If they miss on him I'd look at other centers with the BKN pick but wouldn't take a lesser guy just because he's a C.

(Fortunate timing with @ABREG_1 there, too.) https://t.co/IvJk8Pqhaw@BenDuBose @HoustonRockets So incredibly thankful for how much the @HoustonRockets have done for fans this year. I’m glad we got to spend so much time hanging out!.@HoustonRockets have done some absolutely amazing things for the diehard fans this season.

It's weird — on paper, obviously one of the worst years there will ever be here. But between the team's outreach and the return to crowds after 1.5 years, it's been one of most fun, too. https://t.co/UvjITfb5dpZubac’s gets son’ed by every center in the NBA besides the Houston Rockets.
