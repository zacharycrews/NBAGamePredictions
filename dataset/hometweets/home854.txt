Who was your favorite foreign born NBA player or maybe someone foreign born who didn‚Äôt play in the NBA? #HoopsandHearts@chicagobulls #hoopsandhearts Just wondering what you think about the current state of this Bulls team?  You‚Äôre a big guy so you know how important that is. Can the Bulls be successful this year without having that key big guy to grab the offensive rebounds or protect the paint?With both teams at full strength, the Bulls would likely easily handle the Spurs. Unfortunately for Chicago, several key players are out with injuries, opening the door for Dejounte Murray and Jakob Poeltl ‚Äî and our NBA betting picks ‚Äî to take advantage.

Chicago Bulls -3.5 vs the Spurs

#BullsNation https://t.co/r6xGqpaJdv@WilliamHill #YourOdds San Antonio Spurs vs Chicago Bulls, Dejounte Murray 10+ Assists &amp; 8+ reboundsThe #5 horse, On Point, won so that means we are taking the Bulls Spread!

The Chicago Bulls -3.5 (or less) is the official play tonight. Let‚Äôs see if the CFHRSO can make it to 6-1!!
