https://t.co/fQSsE3tOz4First game sitting lower bowl!!  #TakeNote @utahjazz https://t.co/r5Wl1beIBFAhead of Tuesday's game vs. the Grizzlies, Utah Jazz coach Quin Snyder attacked a pair of narratives — about a lack of clutchness, and Donovan Mitchell not passing to Rudy Gobert — that he perceives as unfair criticisms of how his team plays. https://t.co/e015ffiQB3@utahjazz with this handsome man 😍 @ChaseCalledWell #lucky #TakeNote https://t.co/fyq24o8MaV2 years ago @spidadmitchell visited Bryson at Primary Childrens Hospital while he was waiting for his transplant. He told Bryson he would get him to a game once he was healthy. 2 years later post heart tx Donovan reconnected with Bryson. #TakeNote  @JazzDoingGood @utahjazz https://t.co/Z9Pnh55vLfDuring the 1983-84 NBA season, the Utah Jazz played 11 "home" games at the Thomas &amp; Mack arena in Las Vegas, NV. Hosting the Los Angeles Lakers on Apr 5, 1984, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar passed Wilt Chamberlain as the NBA's all-time leading scorer. https://t.co/WWgd3avZMI https://t.co/nidDT1PqZMThese seats are awful.

#ShootaroundInterviews | @ZionsBankMemphis Grizzlies at Utah Jazz odds, picks and predictions https://t.co/UF1dkgMlBZ@Stricklan_ @trejtra @GrizzliesPR @memgrizz @utahjazz weirdoDoes anyone else feel like Utah Jazz Twitter right now is similar to when the avengers movies had Iron Man and Captain America become enemies? I feel like you have to pick a side #teamrudy or #teamdonovanAccording to @JakeLFischer, if head coach Quin Snyder leaves the #UtahJazz #Jazz, #Sixers #76ers head coach Doc Rivers has been linked as a potential replacement. He worked for CEO Danny Ainge with the #Celtics from 2004-2013.However, according to @JakeLFischer, there is a healthy dose of skepticism around the NBA that #UtahJazz #Jazz head coach Quin Snyder would be interested in coaching the #Lakers because he would appear to be just as prominent a candidate for the #Spurs even if it's after 2022-23.#UtahJazz #Jazz head coach Quin Snyder was a #Lakers assistant coach in 2011-12.According to @JakeLFischer, #UtahJazz #Jazz head coach Quin Snyder is mentioned perhaps the most often by league figures as a possible replacement for #Lakers head coach Frank Vogel and there are rumblings he may be inclined to step away from Utah after this season. https://t.co/bGOz2RALBKI’ve decided I want the Utah Jazz again@NBATV @warriors Thought it was a slow start for the Dubs on Saturday night, the squad caught on fire in the fourth quarter and closed the contest on a 24-4 run to earn a 111-107 victory over the Utah Jazz.

Utah Jazz -5 -120 (buy the half pt) 

Grizz don't have anything to play for, they're locked in at the two spot. Utah should be desperate for this one as they are on the bubble.

GOOD luck to all@hopalong13 @975Hans @utahjazz And his 4th quarter decision making and defense have been questionable, as well.  Can't forget that cross-court pass that was picked off for 2 towards the end of the game. Quin, I think, yanked him at that next timeout.@HaterMuse @rniels20 Should Utah Jazz trade Donovan Mitchell?Utah Jazz are 1-6 over the last 7 games.....rudy scored 25 in that win.....

https://t.co/xXQoLAvkaoWhat can the Jazz do to prevent other teams from coming back on them? #TakeNote #NBA #UtahJazz https://t.co/nU0due1X9w@AlBernstein All I know is my Utah Jazz need to keep an eye on drafting these North Carolina kids. They blew a sure-thing lead as effortlessly as any Jazz squad could do! And appropriately on the biggest stage.

Nobody is throwing passes at Rudy's knees lmao, he just has bad hands. Other tall bigs in the league (Hassan included) catch the same passes on a nightly basis.@chase_riepl @AEC_PA @BensHoops @utahjazz @kslsports This is such a shit argument. The dude can score.
