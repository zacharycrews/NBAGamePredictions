I‚Äôm here for the Watson to Atlanta I just don‚Äôt want to over pay for it.@Mazy_Day @PatrickR_1 @GASportsNow @AtlantaFalcons @Braves @ATLHawks LONG term says to pick up Malik Willis or another QB in the draft, save your other picks and let him learn for a year or so behind Ryan.. and build your team and select players that can be developed..

He'll be suspended some games anyway and next years cap is HUGE and we can build that way for his first FULL season. This year will be tough for sure but a plan is there LONG term.@Unashamed_Chuck @GASportsNow @AtlantaFalcons @Braves @ATLHawks It isn‚Äôt even close.
