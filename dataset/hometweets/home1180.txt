Everyone focuses on the worst week of Miami’s season yet completely IGNORES the fact they’ve been winning all season and even last week but lets just talk about the “drama”.@itsNeezy__ @TheKidd205 @mldiffley @BleacherReport @JakeLFischer He’s also an extension of Riley on the bench. He absolutely did not take LeBron’s shit. Riley wasn’t on the bench during games, Spo was. The entire organization got him to buy into Heat culture. He was even taking charges while he was in Miami. That’s a result of coaching.As of right now it looks like Marcus Smart is the betting favorite to win #DPOY while Miami Heat big man Bam Adebayo is 2nd. For reference, betting $100 on Bam to win would net $380 total. https://t.co/HGnfxE4awX@TKORio_ @itsAntWright He has his job in spite of lebron tho lol.
