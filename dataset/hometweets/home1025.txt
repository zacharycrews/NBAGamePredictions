https://t.co/xkLbcuYArE https://t.co/SL0xybiZ0O@utahjazz @ATTSportsNetRM @kristablunk @nayocampbell @sportsiren @kristenkoz32 Love this! Appreciate commentators that know the subject matter, do their homework, and prepare for each specific event/teams involved. I’m confident this group will do all that and it will be an enjoyable and insightful broadcast. Kudos Jazz!A lot of the reason I do it is that people just can't go for many reasons.  People are going through an awful lot in life. It is actually sort of stunning to read the trials people face. Anyway, maybe the #UtahJazz games are a way to help in some small way.  I love the Jazz!Ok, so a ton of new followers today.  I am a transplanted California guy who fell in love with the #UtahJazz I have season tickets but I miss a lot of games and give away tickets.  I do this throughout the season. I know others do it here too.

#Pnxbet https://t.co/QgM3Wo1aJpDon't like the fact that the corrupt mayor who gets killed at the beginning of #TheBatman is named Don Mitchell. Sideman is better anyway, right @utahjazz? #TakeNote"Why do Lakers fan hate Utah's 14th largest city?"

[via r/utahjazz Mar 14, 2018 #Jazz]@sportsiren @utahjazz @RyanQualtrics Gotta admit, this is better than any athletic accomplishment.  Even thought its sorta-kinda tied to an athletic accomplishment."Jae Crowder with the smooth behind-the-back pass to Jonas Jerebko for 3"

They get an exception.Since Feb 1st Jordan Clarkson is #1 on the #UtahJazz in +/- at 9.9 while Rudy Gobert is #12 on the team during the same span at -1.5. Rudy is still ranked #1 on the season while Clarkson sits at #4

I'm a Jazz fan, but I loved what he brought to you guys during the playoffs. Seriously, @utahjazz need some of that...@utahjazz @MichelobULTRA As long as he’s your sixth man you’ll never win a thing. @JordanClarksons@utahjazz @terrellowens So do we have a texas native on the jazz@SaltCitySwagger @terrellowens @utahjazz I loved him when he was young and hungry, but he was such a Prima Donna later.@Airbnb @utahjazz    thank you for what you are doing with the refugees escapingI remember Tom Hanks testing positive and like half the Utah Jazz basketball team having it, with truly gripping clarity.After missing a combined 83 games, the Milwaukee Bucks will welcome Brook Lopez and George Hill back to the lineup against the Utah Jazz. #FearTheDeer https://t.co/VzA85pYYI3courtside seats to a utah jazz or phoenix suns game probably $200@Bullskickass @LarentaeMabins @nuggets @utahjazz @chicagobulls U already know@LarentaeMabins SMH got damn ridiculous, I’ll b rooting for @nuggets and @utahjazz  tomorrow too lol 😂 while simultaneously always rooting for @chicagobulls 💯💯💯#BullsNation@nickdid_ @rudygobert27 @utahjazz ready@colby_colonel @JordanClarksons @utahjazz Sixth Man again 2022🏀@JamesWClawson @utahjazz How fun! Nice job getting the kids engaged so young!Sometimes I think people forget a wins a win no matter the score. 76ers barely beat Orlando in OT and Memphis barely beat OKC. Winning is hard in the NBA. I don’t care how Jazz win just want the W. #utahjazz #TakeNote@Got_Tacos @utahjazz @spurs Wow!!! I wish I would have known.
