Also how will the refs call each game based on that. In the end Dubs are more talented &amp; win in 5 if they win 1st 2 at home or 7 if C's steal one of 1st 2.@warriors Let's go #DubNation@warriors look at my boy wilt back at it again@warriors 1, 2, 3, just us!@pooleSZN3 @warriors PTSD TIME BABY https://t.co/fBufCwZP5C@warriors Take care of the ball and don't foul to much Goodluck tonight dubsGood luck!!!!!! @warriors @WarriorNationCP https://t.co/WtySxbFss8Golden State Warriors - Boston Celtics

Offensive versatility and depth will prove enough to overcome The Celtics defense. Warriors’ team defensive communication and rotation will suffocate the Celtics who just don’t have enough shooting to spread GS out. GS wins the tug of war over lineup size.GOLDEN STATE WARRIORS -4, -110, 1u

#NBAFinals@undisputed @ShannonSharpe The @warriors backbone always was Steph, Klay + Dray

Both GSW + KD had a golden opportunity come their way when Kevin went to the Bay Area 💯

KD might be a better player than Steph, per se.
But Curry was more important ✅
And @Money23Green was too 🙂

I have Celtics in 7! 😃

#nba #nbafinals #warriors #celtics #photoshop https://t.co/kS6f4eNk01@LAcarddude Yes. Celtics are by far the best team Warriors have played in the playoffs (i say that as a Grizz fan). Also, since Steve Kerr started coaching the Warriors in 2014, only one team has a winning record against Golden State…the Boston Celtics 

Tonight will be tough tho@ChaseCenter @warriors I'd enthusiastically give up my toes just to be here@phil_hellmuth @chamath @warriors Damn Phil lookin lean, but not so mean 😁 !! You had a GUT when I saw u MCing the #CSOP event at Borgata few yrs back lol

Relative to the field yes, but the numbers for @StephenCurry30 show a drop off in efficiency and he hasn’t been the best player on the court. This can happen but he’s the best shooter in history it’s a high bar that he set for himself. https://t.co/kV6wZXzFZSI guess now is as good a time as any for my #NBAFinals prediction…

I’m going Warriors in 7.

Should be a very close, competitive series, but I will take Golden State’s experience as the deciding factor.

Golden State Warriors -3.5 (-120)

Golden State is way too experienced to lose in Game 1. The Warriors have too many pieces for Boston to stop and I expect them to take a game or two to adjust to Golden State’s playing style.

I do apologize to my @celtics friends, @GlennBrasher and @Stucker10 but the Celtics are in my top 5 most hated teams/people in sports. So let’s go Warriors in 4!!#NBAFinals2022🏀NBA PLAY🏀

Golden State ML -160 (1.5U)

Golden State has been resting after finishing the Mavs in 5 while Boston went a full 7 games Vs Miami. Golden State has too many weapons and the crowd will be LOUD. Don’t see the Warriors losing Game 1 at home.Tonight is the night for #Boston to steal one in #SanFrancisco. Rust could be an issue for the #Warriors. Or, it may not be. Point is, if #GoldenState looks rough out of the gate, then the #Celtics can’t let them off the hook. 🍀🍀🍀🍀🍀🍀@warriors @ChaseCenter Poole Party tonight...!!!!🏊‍♀️🏊🏊‍♂️🎷🎺🎊🎉🎉 https://t.co/3sz69QxZQgAnd now let’s examine the opposing team… The Golden State Warriors are collectively my favorite team to look at but let’s get into the standouts! https://t.co/Kb6yuihhyFGary Payton II, Otto Porter Jr. and Andre Iguodala are all available tonight for the Warriors in Game 1 of the Finals.

Golden State is whole.One thing to watch in Game 1 is the health &amp; energy level of both teams

@Warriors had full week of rest while @celtics only had 3 days of rest coming off physical 7-game series 

Will #Warriors be rusty?
Can #Celtics keep their momentum?

Golden State: Andrew Wiggins… if Wiggins gets ghost and disappears.. Bill Russell is popping champagne.. 

Boston: if Al Horford shows up like he has all playoffs and he outplays the Warriors bigs… Boston wins this SeriesWarriors are nearly unbeatable when Draymond does this

Draymond Green does a lot of things on the basketball court, but shooting threes usually isn’t one of them. Golden State posted a 19-1 record when Green made one triple this season.

The Warriors will have the advantage of starting things off at home, where they are 9-0 during their playoff run. That comes on the heels of them posting a 31-10 record at home during the regular season.

If anything it’s an advantage for Golden State. They’re much better rested and will be healthier.NBA Finals 2022 – Boston Celtics fan already has tattoo predicting win over Golden State Warriors https://t.co/z8Ljuf14a2Game 1 nba finals let's @warriors is back 
#DubNationLET'S GO @warriors!!! 💙💛💙💛 #Warriors #DubNation #goldblooded https://t.co/1x3qmxb2WpCELTICS🍀. WARRIORS⚔️. GAME 1. NBA FINALS🏀.

Can Jayson Tatum and the Celtics pull off the game 1 upset (+140) or will the experienced Golden State Warriors (-170) be too much to handle... 

#ThisIsHowWePlaySports https://t.co/FE4ViJUfHX@OfficialJ0hn_ @warriors This is the dumbest take I’ve ever seen@lapioche6x @warriors I've got no confidence bro. They just seem to have everything they need to beat us@gamdom @warriors @celtics Warriors 92 - 100 Celtics@NBA @warriors @StephenCurry30 You all keep sleeping on and disrespecting this legend. Chef it is time to put on a show. Bring the All Star game shooting performance to this series. Get that MVP and that Chip.  Prove everyone wrong one more time@celtics will win if Wardell’s brother in law plays anything other than mop up minutes. @warriors@gamdom @warriors @celtics Warriors 108 - 100 CelticsBreaking down Warriors-Celtics regular-season matchups

However, Boston has played well against Golden State in recent matchups, winning six of its last seven games against the Warriors going back to 2019.

Sincerely,

https://t.co/xKNGZIf4yp@Tlalocin @NBA @warriors @celtics @YouTubeTV Boston hasn’t missed the playoffs since 2014 😂@warriors I’ve been looking at Steph’s 3-pt shooting, I think his shooting lately does have as much arc as in the past. More arc please, Mr. Curry. AND, Dubs, please more offensive rebounding. Look at how many offensive rebounds you had in game 1 vs later in the last series.#dubs@niccolomannion @warriors Fashion traffic light 🤣@LeGoatburner1 @BenA55728275 @NBAMuse24 @WarriorsMuse @StatMamba @StephenCurry30 @CurryMuse @antonin_org @OnBallSteph @ramon_rican @GinaReppinDaBay @warriors @StephMuse_ so Kd and Klay don't count for 2019?@warriors No #WhiteHot?

What a JOKE! This isn’t Golden State from 5 years ago.  Draymond is a shell of his former self, Klay is up and down and none of their filler players is truly a standout. Only Curry is the real deal. #Celticsin6 ☘️@OriginalNomads @warriors @celtics Go Bucks! 🤣 @Lana28144898 @GiancarloChaux @Lfgmarketingnft@celtics @warriors @985TheSportsHub GAME DAY !!🍀🍀@niccolomannion @warriors Yo nico how you been bro@TrolledByTrig Golden State Warriors 💛💙.

The last 4 matches have been awesome.Wow, the NBA Finals will be a Showdown to Remember! The well-rested Veteran led Warriors take on the Spry and Youthful challenger, Celtics. 

2 great Teams, 2 different Styles. 

I believe Golden State will edge out in 6.

We made the Playoffs like 9 years straight....lol..@ACCIDlC @warriors warriors in 6😍@warriors I had a dream last night, dubs won by 12 and Steph's the best player 🙏Is Boston Celtics vs. Golden State Warriors a dream series for the NBA Finals?

Legendary news anchor Dan Rather says the matchup could be epic. Does @MikeDSykes agree? Does Twitter? https://t.co/pCplH3KAwo@ACCIDlC @warriors Disappointed 😢Golden State in 6 Yup I said it.... #NBA #NBAFinals #GoldenStateWarriors #Celtics #feezdapopstar #partygetlitGive me Celtics in 6. Boston has to win Game 1 tonight or that prediction definitely isn’t coming true. Admittedly, Boston’s injuries are a big concern. But Golden State doesn’t have Oracle, and the Warriors are not as battle tested as their opponent. Hoping for good games.Both are bad fanbase, hate both teams but I guess @warriors will have to do in 6.Will the Golden State Warriors reignite their dynasty or will the Boston Celtics end a decade-long wait for an NBA title?

Celtics have clear matchup advantages but Golden State has ball movement and pace of play that Boston hasn’t seen, on top of a better offense overall and more experience.The @celtics are similar to the 2015 version of the team they're facing in the NBA Finals. 

The Celtics are young and tough and skilled — just Stephen Curry, Draymond Green and Klay Thompson were at the beginning of the @warriors reign.

//A Thread//✅

1. The Warriors have to get out in transition and maximize fast break points via defensive rebound or turnovers because the Celtics are prone to careless turnovers and bad shot selection.
#WarriorsSince becoming the head coach for the Warriors, Steve Kerr is 21-02 straight up in game one of a playoff series. I see Golden State at -3.5 and -4 at some outs. If you are so inclined they are -160 on the M/L. I will just watch and maybe jump in for a live betting opportunity.@GallFAM4 @warriors Go Warriors!!!!I’m going with the Celtics in 6 games. I think their physicality matches up very well with Golden State’s offense. I could be underestimating the Warriors, but I think the Celtics D will thrive against a perimeter based offense. I also predict a big series for Jaylen Brown. https://t.co/9xpaUULEqlHere we go!!!! Inside the Chase Center where @celtics and @warriors tip it off at 9pm live on @WMUR9.

What I am pretty sure of is that both sides are +EV and the Warriors have a better shot to go up 10 at home. Since I don’t trust my method of calculation, I’m going to go against the numbers for the first time in a few months and play Golden State.@NBA @celtics @warriors @YouTubeTV In my opinion 2 things are going to happen the Celtics are going to win or the warriors will win take that to the bankFinally, the #NBAFinals!

Curry vs. Tatum. 
Experience vs. Youth. 
Dynasty vs. Defense

Steph Curry era, Golden State are 4-1 in Game 1 of the NBA Finals. Game 1's Boston has gone 1-2, getting outscored 333-311. 

Warriors -4 (-110) vs. Celtics +4 (-110)

I watch a lot of playoff sports, and the Warriors play like champions with a chip on their shoulders.

#NBAFinals #BostonCeltics #GoldenStateWarriors@Rjeff24 2014-15 @warriors were by far least experienced Dubs team to reach Finals. Curry was in year 6 while Klay year 4 &amp;  Draymond 3rd. This myth the 2014-15 Dubs were this "Superteam" couldn't be further from the truth. Dubs lost in 1st rnd of playoffs year before #NBATodayBoston is capable of beating Golden State, but im rolling with the Warriors. Years of final experience. Homecourt in the series. All healthy.

I think Boston needs to make 15-18 3’s a game to stay close. They only managed to make more than 15 3’s once against the Heat (Game2: 20. Won 127-102).

On the other end keep the ball moving! #DubNation"Celtics of the 60s... Jordan's Bulls... Showtime... The Spurs... and the Warriors, whatever this stretch is, it's Top 5 ever."

Boston has had two straight tough and physical matchups with Miami and Milwaukee. I really didn’t like some of their play against Miami, especially in big spots. The Warriors have had the rest, the offensive firepower and the championship…Good news for Golden State!

@warriors @StephenCurry30 @NBA https://t.co/Gtg2YXMjU7SAN FRANCISCO — When Steve Kerr looks at the way the Boston Celtics built a championship-caliber team, he sees plenty of similarities to how his Golden State Warriors got to the NBA Finals in 2015. https://t.co/oynYcbhb6DKevin Durant, Draymond Green beef on Twitter I What's Wright? #GoldenState #Warriors #NBA https://t.co/Oc2JvMFwf9@NBA @YouTubeTV @celtics @warriors Good Luck for the upcoming matches to both teams. Would be fun watching this. 🍀✌️@Money23Green is a LOCK for the Hall of Fame and in my opinion has had more influence and impact on this Golden State Warriors team than most give him credit for. 

Also, Ben Wallace is a No Doubt Hall of Famer Flannel…I’m disappointed. https://t.co/wPUPd3U0bJ@whit2wavvy @native_ace @donkeydawg12 @jeffvan33471268 @peter_zakii @warriors @ChaseCenter Still 3-1 against LeBron 🤷🏼‍♂️ Plus if we was fully healthy we would of won 🤷🏼‍♂️@warriors don’t let racism win tonight@Chris_Alcocer1 @scubasteve028 @MikeJonesyomama @barstoolsports Except, they didn’t move. They’re the Golden State Warriors. They were never the Oakland Warriors. They simply chose to build an arena in San Fran. As the 49ers chose Santa Clara for Levi’s. In this discussion, you’d have an better argument with not counting the 2 Philly titles@warriors If it reaches game 7😂@celtics @warriors @985TheSportsHub Regardless of what happens in this series, this season has been awesome. Best Celtics season in my lifetime. Now let’s go win this thingIt would not be shocking to see the #Warriors to use all their rest to drive the pace in tonight's #NBAFinals #Game1 

Golden State is 7-0-1 OU since 17-18 when piayed with at least 5 days between games.

https://t.co/L6TbOpsZDGThese @celtics are much closer to the 2015 version of the @warriors than the 2022 one.

They’re young and tough and skilled — not dissimilar to how Curry, Green and Thompson initiated the beginning of their reign.

https://t.co/UtcmlUJFh0 https://t.co/VVGqS1s7KDA lot has happened since the @warriors' last NBA Finals appearance three years ago, including Kevin Durant's departure and major injuries to Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson.

“And we’re back here,” Curry said. “So it’s pretty special.”

How he keeps getting recognized by the league tells you they accept his incompetence. Goble not much better either.Finally today!!! 🤩
I really see great expectations from #AllAbout18 and it depends of his J’s and the defense from Williams and Smart.
#GoldBlooded Depends of the joy from the #SplashBrothers and J Pool, Green have to motivate the defense.

I think @warriors win in 6!

Draymond Green does a lot of things on the basketball court, but shooting threes usually isn’t one of them. Golden State posted a 19-1 record when Green made one triple this season.

I agree with your statement.

This is not the only way to create parity. A hard cap would be extremely effective.Colorado Avalanche 1-0 Edmonton Oilers

New York Rangers 1-0 Tampa Bay Lightning

Golden State Warriors-Boston Celtics@rob_parritt I was leaning Warriors in 5 bc I worry about Boston’s knack for taking quarters off and Golden state will hang 50 in a quarter if you take it off. But I feel like Dubs in 6 seems way more reasonable. I wouldn’t be shocked if Boston took it 7, I would be surprised if Boston wins.@NBAMuse24 @WarriorsMuse @StatMamba @StephenCurry30 @CurryMuse @antonin_org @OnBallSteph @ramon_rican @GinaReppinDaBay @warriors @StephMuse_ You niggas cannot read im convinced lol.

Let them work where they want, with who they want. We can build a system that does both: is fair to teams and players.

This isn't something I just thought up one day. It has bothered me for decades, and something I woke up to very slowly over many years.

Golden State have won their last 14 Game 1’s at home in the NBA playoffs, with an average winning margin of 16. 

The last loss? Game one of the historic Conference Finals in 2016.

Perhaps Celtics fans think the Dubs are due a loss 🤔 https://t.co/sVhlyymqWuNot even rooting for anyone hardcore here, but the Golden State Warriors basically invented a new style of basketball and while it’s a different team they can still win a championship just fine?

Thats just me@purpleandddgold @ThankYouTaceGod @boydonttryme @KDTrey5 Look at the makeup of the fanbase. 😂😂😂 Golden State Warriors cowardly afraid to try to face Lebron with that same 73-9 roster.

You’re making my point for me lol@MahomesToClyde @CelticsRiley @celtics @warriors @NBA I'm laying out a deeply considered position, and I'm right.

You are hurling insults because you don't want to think about something you are comfortable with, that's wrong. 🤷🤣@ibrahimracho412 @rzygtx @NBAMuse24 @WarriorsMuse @StatMamba @StephenCurry30 @CurryMuse @antonin_org @OnBallSteph @ramon_rican @GinaReppinDaBay @warriors @StephMuse_ Ok you can add Lebron, Curry won 3/4 against him 💀@CaptnKnuckles @StephenCurry30 @warriors 😤😤😤 Preciate that Brodie 🙏🏿🙏🏿@DubsRedeemed @rzygtx @NBAMuse24 @WarriorsMuse @StatMamba @StephenCurry30 @CurryMuse @antonin_org @OnBallSteph @ramon_rican @GinaReppinDaBay @warriors @StephMuse_ Bro has to hype himself up on a Twitter argument he's losingGolden State Warriors and Boston Celtics Poised for NBA Finals Classic https://t.co/WIswO1w5d8Golden State got home court advantage ?

I said in the eastern conference finals. All you’re showing me is that if he had to play more than 1 all nba first teamer in his conference like Curry does he maybe would lost more in the east@warriors One game at a time. Let's get this dub!@warriors Remarkable stories of the Warriors in this playoff finals.
Let´s go Warriors.🏀🏀🏀🏀@Alexgr8white @Zeno1273 @CelticsRiley @celtics @warriors @NBA You aren't listening.@hornbecksteve1 @HeathMaxwell @alextheballller @CelticsRiley @celtics @warriors @NBA Of course small market teams will overpay for young talent. Why do teams tank now to get high draft picks?

Of course it would work that way. If anything, players would sign with their local team more often.@KingsRatio @warriors that swaggy p? lol@StacyGSG @Espngreeny Enjoy your time in the 'city by the bay' ... I truly did leave my heart there many years ago ... the Wharf, Ghiradelli Square, the Cannery, Chinatown, Cable Cars ... Sourdough Bread!  And years later, I left my heart with the @warriors and can't wait for Game 1 tomorrow night!Niggas who think the Celtics gone be the Golden State warriors have to be fans man 😂😂@celtics @warriors @Grant2Will Please take note of the above. Help bring Brittney Griner home. We have to pressure the @WhiteHouse and @POTUS or BG isn’t coming home.

https://t.co/loj87OnteU@warriors Timelord isn't sleeping tonight because tomorrow he need to face Kevon King Looney@RCasparriello @alextheballller @CelticsRiley @celtics @warriors @NBA It's true that players gave more control than they used to, thanks to the hard work of people like Dr. J who demanded free agency as part of the merger.

Ben Simmons is still playing under the same contract. It was *not* easy for him to force a move.@TheTrillestTree @NBAMuse24 @OnBallSteph @WarriorsMuse @StatMamba @StephenCurry30 @CurryMuse @antonin_org @ramon_rican @GinaReppinDaBay @warriors @StephMuse_ Old ass had ya account since 2013 get a job@warriors to celtics win@TheTrillestTree @NBAMuse24 @OnBallSteph @WarriorsMuse @StatMamba @StephenCurry30 @CurryMuse @antonin_org @ramon_rican @GinaReppinDaBay @warriors @StephMuse_ Get off my profile weirdoGolden State in five, keeping up with the theme of the "blah" NBA playoffs.
