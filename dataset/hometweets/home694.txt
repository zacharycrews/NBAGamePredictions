The NBA has a history of success expanding to markets w no major 4 teams, so I think Omaha might be a good market &amp; KC might root for them@RScottWilson @KyleBaileyClub @hornets At first I thought no, but the more I think about it, our depth and three ball. Real close. #AllFly@SoulCitySigma @hornets It is odd because KC (or StL) make a lot of sense as a place for an NBA franchise. I think both cities would support a team well.@RScottWilson @KyleBaileyClub @hornets Not until we get a big man Alonzo styleSince fan voting for the NBA All-Star game ends tonight, we did our best to help rally some votes for LaMelo Ball, Miles Bridges &amp; Terry Rozier!
