Time to get back to being the best player in basketball.@antonin_org I get it, the "San Francisco Bay Area" sports market includes the 49ers, Giants, A's, Sharks, and Warriors.

The Golden State Warriors just play in SF, they are not a SF team.

The 49ers are a SF team that plays home games in Santa Clara.

It was just an observation.

No Klay, no Dray, no igoudala, no wiseman, for Golden State. I like the Jazz without Mitchell to win outright, Gobert will dominate Kevon Looneu who is only 6’9, look for the Jazz to attack the paint and hold off a stagnant Warriors offense without Green. https://t.co/AOj4h9mI8Z@warriors @Oracle Please don‘t use the Curry 9💩@warriors @Oracle make them in game pls@warriors @StephenCurry30 Nicely very nice@warriors @Oracle Please go off curry , It’s painful watching games where you shoot under 40% and score under 25 points.

Either, or 😎💁🏽‍♂️ https://t.co/vbtbc6yUK7@gogobobo711 @warriors You stupid. He was never 0-10 . In the first place . He’s been slumping like this for more than a month .

#StephenCurry for #NBAAllStar@InsideCarolina I’m at a loss, every team looks like the 2017 version of the Golden State Warriors against them. Every team is comfortable with getting any shot they want. Carolina is a weak team. An absolute weak team. I could see if the cabinet was bare. But they are just weak minded.@warriors Let's vote #StephenCurry for #NBAAllStar@warriors Let's goo🔥🔥
