@104JEG0783 @EnesFreedom @NBA @chamath @warriors I agree with his stance.  This is the sending thoughts and prayer take.  Everyone likes to virtue signal, but we pulled out of Afghanistan and left the whole country, and its women and children to fend for itself.  No one cares, really, be honest with yourself.@MoeJenkins10 @EnesFreedom @NBA @chamath @warriors and they are not saying it right.

Though typing it the differences between how they say it to how you are supposed to might obliterate my account.Just a few minutes away from tip-off as the Warriors host the No. 1 pick @CadeCunningham_  and the Pistons. Golden State is hoping to get back the top spot in the Western Conference as the Pistons struggle to keep any miracle of playoff hopes alive.

He represents the league and his views are yours. #banforlife@injaelee @michaelsobolik @warriors @chamath All the people saying the Chinese govt is worse than the US govt apparently just conveniently forgot about all the regime change ops, sanctions, &amp; wars the US conducted over the last 50 years.

You're probably one of the armed guys stealing French Bulldogs from little old ladies in the Bay Area...!@tomgrundy @virgingalactic @chamath @warriors Disagree with Chamath. But we have to be fair.

In fact, we should highlight the fact that later in the podcast he questioned whether Uyghur internment was real or severe. His reckless indifference is more troubling. His moral triaging isn't.@AnewbiZ007 @Nuttallreports @michaelsobolik @warriors @chamath I do have a clue, I‚Äôm uyghurOnly a matter of time until @warriors drop @chamath@EnesFreedom @NBA @chamath @warriors Do you care enes? I don't see you chartering the next private jet out to help or putting your large paychecks to work, to make a difference? Chamaths point is nobody here truly cares in the sense they'd actually do something about it. And to that extent he's right‚ÄòIt‚Äôs below MY line‚Äô. The million people in concentration camps.
