#NBA #GamblingTwitter #Total #BookieThere are strong rumors of a possible trade that sends Bojan Bogdanovic to #Celtics in exchange for Marcus Smart, Dennis Schr√∂der and 2 2nd round picks.

Marcus Smart cannot be traded until January 25, until that day the #UtahJazz will continue to listen to offers.

#TakeNote https://t.co/5v4v50LaA9@beefalo123 @TheJerrbear1 @jthayne_91 It was after his first contract with Utah.

https://t.co/CDr6ePkb9z@utahjazz It means I get to hear about how bad I am because of stuff that happened before I was born and had no control over.@utahjazz Not this shit again@BrianCr28986856 @utahjazz I disagree! The only one is gobert‚Ä¶ he brings it every night he plays‚Ä¶ Mitchell for sure does not! TRADE HIM PLEASE@Mr1738 üòÇ I remember that beat down, too. That 54 from the Utah Jazz is the fewest points that a team has scored in a NBA Finals game: https://t.co/uUKqIJJNkNWent to the @utahjazz  game and gave a lucky kid a Safemoon signed Basketball üèÄ #SAFEMOONARMY #SAFEMOONFAMILY #Safemoon #SAFEMOONWALLET #SAFEMOONV2 #SAFEMOONBLOCKCHAIN #SAFEMOONCOMMUNITY #SAFEMOONCONNECT https://t.co/4vfOpyHDIlTag a friend you think should apply ‚§µÔ∏è

#TakeNote https://t.co/KOeyjEPDY6What does Black History Month mean to you? üé®

We want to see your art themed around basketball, history, and the Black experience for a chance to have your design produced and featured on apparel and ticket to attend a Jazz game this season.

üîó: https://t.co/Dstw1o5VpO https://t.co/gEXEeCOZjl@HeadbandRoyce @ShamsCharania @TheAthletic @Stadium @utahjazz One of my favorite jazz players. I‚Äôm about it. Idk about him having a bigger contribution with the jazz though‚Ä¶@UniWatch New Orleans Jazz to Utah Jazz is an abomination@utahjazz Jazz need to watch Phoenix. Jazz just don't have the swagger they once did.@sccav_ @FrogmansWorld @Celtics_fan78 @TheBostonKid617 @SpencerKeele @TheMontyShow I gotcha. To me seems it doesn‚Äôt matter if he‚Äôs ‚Äú7th best‚Äù because it‚Äôs not a straight swap from Boston to Utah. Jazz don‚Äôt need him to do anything but defend. But I see your point for sure.@utahjazz @WasatchFord And Russ ram it on Rudyüí™üèºCongratulations to meowmeow826 who moved up 78 spots to take #64 on the Utah Jazz team leaderboard.

https://t.co/CDr6ePkb9z@NickRevws I‚Äôd love to see him on my Utah Jazz as long as we keep Donovan and Gobert.What's the first sports team accessory I should get for my 4Runner? I already have Utah Jazz license plates ü§î@JingIesss Makes me wonder if @spidadmitchell asks/tells Quin to play Eric (instead of the garbage defenders like @JordanClarksons)--and if Quin would/does listen
#DoesTheFranchisePlayerHaveSway 
#UtahJazzDropping the price to 25 bucks a piece for my two jazz tickets on row 10 in the upper bowl tomorrow. If anyone wants them pls dm.. @JingIesss @utahjazz@TavanParker Under #EricPaschall, #ElijahHughes, and #JaredButler, the #NBA box score should say "DNP-Coach's Insistence" or "DNP-Coach's Punishment", and "DNP-Coach's Demotivation"
#UtahJazzThe Utah Jazz would have beaten the Chicago Bulls in the NBA Finals if they had a decent point guard.@utahjazz @ZionsBank Still took that L though huh?@hairyscarecrow @utahjazz @AFCU The Jazz band was great!  Loved having them at the games.@HallieOop Love the sarc. 

What's more inspiring is when players make shots in games--and sometime earlier than the 36 minutes that @BucketsONeale00 played, Quin should have inspired #ElijahHughes to try to perform during the fact; what would've they had to lose but the loss
#UtahJazz@adaowebby @tribjazz Quin needs to enforce that personal ownership--and bench players when they don't own their D
@JordanClarksons 
#UtahJazz@NbaGenius548 @tribjazz Yeah, but the #Utahjazz doesn't seem to listen to that leader

Hell, they don't even pass Rudy the ball enough, even when a &gt;50% PnR dunk has a higher chance against a small-ball team than a 26% 3pM (39% eFG) by selfish wings (even though selfish Spida wasn't playing)
#TakeNote@UniWatch Utah Jazz is just wrong.@utahjazz My brother and I were huge AD fans. We snuck into a practice at Westminster. A ball rolled to our end of the court and AD ran after it. He looked up at us and yelled ‚Äúhow you guys doing?‚Äú. We both choked and forgot how to speak English. What a pitiful display that was.@utahjazz NOBODY from the Jazz deserve a spot on the all-star team.

They should be voting WINNERS to the spots!
