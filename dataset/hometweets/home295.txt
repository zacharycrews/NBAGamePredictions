Garland is a baller but he can’t seem to get us over the hump like sexton could. I miss him so much. Hopefully having Mobley back helps create some offense/spacing. Nice to get cedi back too@obss_baller14 @cavs @_bigjayy_ @keybank I love Garland and I know he’s great, but a lot of the 2nd half of our games seems like he’s just trying to play hero ball and win the game by himself. These 2nd half’s that we’ve been losing are where we miss Sexton the most since he can just go get a bucket whenever lol@jimmybuckets_ @cavs @_bigjayy_ @keybank The past 3 or 4 games we dominate the first half and even some of the 3rd, but jeez we can never buy a bucket in the 4th🏀 @OrlandoMagic at @Cavs Preview 🏀

I’d get on the tank train, imagine him and Mobley #scaryhours@nba_paint @channingfrye @cavs @RoadTrippinPod Need a face..@JM539581 @nba_paint @channingfrye @cavs @RoadTrippinPod I love it too can’t wait for chapter 3@619sports yes it is Frank Vogel's fault and that's why the Cleveland Cavaliers Coach never made the playoffs after Lebron James left Cleveland and Frank Vogel would have never made the playoffs with the Lakers if Lebron James wasn't on the LakersThe Lakers have big time Cleveland Cavaliers energy attached to them. A terrible, poorly run franchise that LeBron carried to a ring, and will promptly regress to one of the worst teams in the league once he leavesNext game is tomorrow (Saturday, November 27th) at 8pm vs. the Cleveland Cavaliers (9-10). GO MAGIC!Only one NBA team has a winning record in games when they shoot 30% or worse from 3: the Cleveland Cavaliers are 4-3 in such games. The Cavs are 5-7 in games they shoot better than 30% from 3. Odd. 🤷‍♂️@StephenCurry30 is doing for the @warriors  what @KingJames did for the @cavs back in 2016. #🎒Chet Holmgren is playing Center for #Gonzaga tonight against #Duke, but he’s built like a future backup shooting guard for the Cleveland #Cavaliers. You cannot be 7’0 and weigh like 190 pounds. I’m sure he’ll get there, but man he is skinny right now.@JoshYohe_PGH You mean like what LeBron did to that Cleveland cavaliers exec?Garland

Double punHello @cavs can you please turn on your tv to #DukevsGonzaga and reevaluate your winning games strategy #TankforChet #TankforBanchero@FanDuel Detroit Lions and Cleveland Cavaliers are pretty close.@JoeStupp @J_Berry_14 @SirYacht_ How is that similar to the Browns moving to Baltimore? The Cavs were the Cleveland Cavaliers and they moved back to Cleveland.#nbatopshotthanksgiving Defiantly thankful for this Anderson Varejeo RIB! He was the missing peace to the @cavs set for me and was an all time favorite player watching him play for the Cavs.
