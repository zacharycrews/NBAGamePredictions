Living in Omaha this is a rare event. But which to pick?? Would love to see @JaMorant or @KingJames but will either be playing? Any advice @NoDunksInc@GrizzliesPR @memgrizz @Suns Memphis has a six game lead over Dallas and Golden State and are 8.5 games behind Phoenix.  Better to rest players before the playoffs than risk injuries in a meaningless game.@Plugss_ @GrizzliesPR @memgrizz @Suns They needed to beat them so they can try and have LA higher in draft order so they get their pick instead of the pelicans@memgrizz @SociosUSA I would say the win against the Spurs, the frenzy nba world was after Ja put a spectacle.
