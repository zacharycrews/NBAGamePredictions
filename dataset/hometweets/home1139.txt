Alex was part of 5 @NBA titles with the @Lakers 1 with the @Raptors #CANMNT did this for him &amp; Al sent me the pic and couldn’t be prouder https://t.co/W2C03TpRYqToronto Raptors lowkey have one of the best chances to win the east. Their opponents could be at a disadvantage when games r in Canada (Vax rule) and we’ve seen how strong/productive the team chemistry is up there.(Cont’d)

Toronto Raptors

When FVV was injured they ran Siakam and Scottie Barnes at the 1 (they did great tbf) that’s all needed to be said for why they would need a back up PG also Malachi Flynn don’t move me

(I couldn’t find a raptors photoshop sadly so here’s Russ confused) https://t.co/E5XJRQ4QXX@jackson5payne The @Raptors would like to invite you to join them. https://t.co/fFFBKNASidToronto Raptors - Minnesota Timberwolves

Thanks for the lovely contest @TangerineHoops 🙂🙏@TangerineHoops @Raptors They used to sell 50/50 tickets in person at games, and volunteers who would get a t-shirt, pizza, and watch the gamesfrom a private box

Having the chance to see a game live was how I learned how fun watching Raptors games is, so that's my favorite memory 🙂

The GM who traded VC for Zo and scrubs has died- much like Heat fan base after LeBron left.

How many points will the big 3 combine for? #RaisedByWolves@TangerineHoops @Raptors when the raps win the chip #7daysofgiveaways@TangerineHoops @Raptors watching the game, especially their game winning shot in 2019! #7DaysofGiveaways@TangerineHoops @Raptors When kids loves the Raptors team and stayed late for the game and win the tangerinefanangle 😍 #7DaysofGiveaways @TangerineHoops https://t.co/L4bJcRtqIv@Imman_Adan The heat have reached the finals more times than the raptors have had 50 win seasons in the last 20 years 😂😂.

There would be a rivalry for sure between the Raptors and a new Montreal team but I don’t see it being toxic until a playoff series or a decade or so have passed.

It was a feeling/moment I will never forget.  Seeing Kawhi bent down on the court is forever embedded in my brain.  The anticipation was unreal. #7DaysofGiveawaysHere is my favourite guys… Because of my love for the Toronto Raptors 🏀 and the skin to go with it looks so clean 🔥 @JPunksNFT @JPunkCommunity #FlexYourRex #TribeCalledRex https://t.co/VShxr7Ci5D https://t.co/qeY2Rtq7iYThe @Raptors organization is looking to continue the conversation - equity for women and girls should not be limited to the month of March.

Talk about your team and talk up your team, sure.  But blatantly ignoring brutal things your team does while calling for murder charges on the other team for a trip is ridiculous.  Yes I'm exaggerating but not by much when it comes to Jack Edwards@BarnesFanClub However he also seems the type that would be bothered a little by the "unfinished feeling" of his time in Toronto.  He never got to play here again as a Raptor.  On that side of things yeah he might regret it a bit.@TangerineHoops @Raptors #7DaysofGiveaways I was in my family room with my mom dad and sister!

#leafsforever@bigbadbruins73 Raptors for the nba leafs for the nhl. Must be something real wrong in Toronto.@TangerineHoops @Raptors Broken down on the 401. #7DaysofGiveaways@BigGame81375698 @YKDurrani @Raptors @Toronto Hahah okay… my interpretation: I’ll play Florida/Carolina over Tampa ALL DAY LONG so y’all can have this one and a top 3 spot in the division for all I care. I’m content with Game 7 2013. Sure you remember that one, almost as bad of a meltdown as the Montreal series last year.🏀🔥 RAPTORS GIVEAWAY 🏀🔥  You and your friends can catch an upcoming Toronto Raptors game in the decked-out VIP Leon’s Furniture Ultimate Living Room Suite!

After that, I’m 100% on team new arena. However, I’m not a fan of the location by Mardi Gras world. @SeanVanderbrook has the best idea - tear down the Zion garage and the post office building. Put the arena there.@TangerineHoops @Raptors Watching at home on the edge of my seat. #7DaysofGiveaways@tennistrader7 @Retro_Rooz_ @JaysGotNext @FrancoisTrentJr @Raptors Celtics last night, Bruins tonight.

After seeing everything Raptors fans are saying when they barely beat the Maine Celtics in over time I am confident the Celtics win the series in 5.@TangerineHoops @Raptors I was leaving early the next morning to go camping but had to stay awake to watch the game and all the excitement that happened downtown. #7DaysofGiveawaysToronto, Canada — Pascal Siakam poured in 40 points as the Toronto Raptors snapped the Boston Celtics’ six-game win streak with a 115-112 overtime victory on Monday.

#DailyTribuneThe @CanadaSoccerEN team hit the court during the @raptors vs @celtics battle in #toronto #WeTheNorth https://t.co/4s1KfYxq42Saying the heat aren’t better than Toronto is immeasurably dishonest. Lowry no longer fit on the current team. He had to go. He’s done fine in Miami however and the heat wipe the raptors. https://t.co/nKnA1t4nou@TangerineHoops @Raptors We called our neighbors to watch in our home with us! #7DaysofGiveaways@TangerineHoops @Raptors Jumping up and down in my family room🏀@TangerineHoops @Raptors My hubby and I watched the game at home when the Raptors won the championship.  We went out to party with everyone on the streets of Toronto afterwards! #7DaysofGiveawaysChris Bosh Toronto Raptors 200 #thehobby #ad https://t.co/wk2eazlwp7Props to the Raptors for somehow landing Grimace for a commercial. That’s a HUGE score! 
Too bad it only happened because the Fry Guys died from covid.

#LeafsForeverESPN’s Stephen A. Smith sees the Miami Heat as being vulnerable to losing to either the Brooklyn Nets or Toronto Raptors in the playoffs.  https://t.co/NELjHw20Hx@TangerineHoops @Raptors I was watching the game with a buddy in my living room 🏀🏀🏀 #7DaysofGiveaways@TraeFor3 @Raptors_Noahh Honestly Toronto is amazing. One of my fav landmarks is referred to as “Jane and Finch”. A pure beauty@rlenhard15 @digitalpoet @slomo450 @TheNBACentral Lol telling on yourself, Scottie initiates Toronto’s offense more often thank you think (again just say you don’t watch any raptors ball). And to answer your efficiency question…while yes there’s some truth to that, Scottie is doing a pretty bang up job there considering.@yeayeahyeahya @antc1924 @DuganTheDm @NBA @Raptors Mo? And talking about grammar.. haha go back to school, get off twitter@yeayeahyeahya @antc1924 @DuganTheDm @NBA @Raptors What you said is delusional@mrdanipak @antc1924 @DuganTheDm @NBA @Raptors What did I say that would of pointed to “ delusional “ fyi I see that you got mo grammar comprehension dudeLeon's is giving YOU a chance to bring home a piece of Toronto Raptors franchise history!

We know how great of an organization and team we have here. We also like people that can spell correctly!@antc1924 @DuganTheDm @NBA @Raptors Games won on the court not on paper@mrdanipak @antc1924 @DuganTheDm @NBA @Raptors It wouldn’t be a test it would of been a blowout and raptors aren’t good that’s the problem that y’all can’t get through ya tiny brainz. Not even talkin shi jus bein hones@antc1924 @DuganTheDm @NBA @Raptors I didnt say we were better..@ZachloyLoy @GarnetMacIntyre @TermineRadio That’s why every game outside of Toronto has a lot of Raptor fans?….. right@malika_andrews Wow @espn acknowledging the @Raptors exist...@yeayeahyeahya @antc1924 @DuganTheDm @NBA @Raptors Im done arguing something that didn’t happen.. Your stars didn’t show up.. or they unvaxed and cannot go to TO, which will work great for you in playoffs. I am not arguing that Celtics are not good.. Raps are good too. Wanted to see healthy Celtics vs us, as a testNo one wants to see the @Raptors in that 1st round 👀@TangerineHoops @Raptors The biggest Raptors fan I know is my brother. #7DaysofGiveaways@TangerineHoops @Raptors I was watching with friends!! #7DaysofGiveaways @carol_belll@TangerineHoops @Raptors At my house with the championship crew. 
We’re Superstitious so we always watch in the basement with my dog constantly barking. #7DaysofGiveaways@TangerineHoops @Raptors With friends huddling over the smallest table at  Scaddabush because we couldn’t get into our usual watering hole. We ate Osmows for dinner for good luck.

GTFO with that didn’t want no smoke BS just hope they don’t play a full Celtics squad in the playoffs the go home in 4🤡
