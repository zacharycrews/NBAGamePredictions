Vaccinated people aren't super spreaders.
Also, you weren't going to attend anyway, so enjoy your Coors Light in your basement TV room.@cselley Canadians are enjoying firing the unvaccinated far too much:  It can’t be pointed out enough how recently Justin Trudeau thought it was unfair to bar the unvaccinated from a Toronto Raptors game, never mind from gainful employment https://t.co/SCwhGiBr4p #cdnpoli@PlayStationCA @Raptors @Sportsnet #Rapshomeopener and #Contest kawhi's laugh@mvpvvni @Raptors Hello!

He shot 38% while averaging 17 shots a game. Cannot have that from your primary ball handler/PG. He needs to be a facilitator first then look for his quality shots.@TallaraGames @Raptors @Senators @Patriots Well at least one out of three are teams are like.  Looking fly in those, by the way :).@Raptors I have 4 seats that I can’t use tonight. It’s too late to donate through the MLSE site.

#Raptors #Senators #Patriots https://t.co/uFPg61m87Q@TerryMackie4 @PhoenixGolf55 @Paul__Jones @Raptors @ScottBarnes561 That was a tough game for Raps, they basically have 6 SF and Birch. Fred needs to play more as true PG now that Lowry is gone. First game he shot like crap. Needs to facilitate more.@PlayStationCA @Raptors @Sportsnet #Rapshomeopener #Contest hate to be cliched but it was the championship of course@LeoRautins @Matt__Devlin @Kayla_Grey @SamMitchellNBA @Nikki_Reyes @TSN_Sports @Raptors @NBATVCanada @JLew1050 Would be nice for Nick Nurse to play Banton alongside Scottie a couple minutes every game to develop chemistry &amp; allow confidence to grow. Kinda like when FVV &amp; Siakam played together years ago for their chemistry &amp; confidence to grow.@PlayStationCA @Raptors @Sportsnet Forever Vince Carter in the dunk contest #Rapshomeopener #Contest@Raptors @GiantsOfAfrica May be build a gym somewhere in the GTA as  well, if possible@HalaFar06855286 @MenaMassoud @Raptors @ScottBarnes561 @JalenRose @maxkellerman @ShannonSharpe Are you okay menaRT: Raptors: #BuiltWithinTour | @GiantsOfAfrica https://t.co/4eA9OBTaD1 @raptors @olgproline @NBACanada@NBACanada @Raptors Hold up didn't Vegas only have us winning 32and a half games 🤣🤣Raptors vs Dallas Mavericks

By the mid point of the season don’t be surprised if several established guys go to new level (Siakam, OG, Fred, Boucher etc) and the new guys like Scottie go crazy.@LeoRautins @Matt__Devlin @Kayla_Grey @SamMitchellNBA @Nikki_Reyes @TSN_Sports @Raptors @dallasmavs @NBATVCanada @JLew1050 Can’t wait! Best broadcast team!👍🏀#WeTheNorth #GetVaxxed #TwineAndWine 🏀🍷@Jack_MC_13 @JKenzie95 @Raptors @pskills43 @ScottBarnes561 76ers would want some PG depth to replace Simmons; Raptors would have to give up more to get the likes of Simmons (Boucher’s expiring contract and Flynn, needing more playing time, would be likely moved) and Wizards would want more for Beal than a hobbled centre &amp; role player.Hey @NFT_NYC early birds!

#WeTheNorth https://t.co/shOlzddVBtGood win by the @Raptors tonight! Curious to see how they'll hold up against teams who follow the scouting reports on this young Raptors squad. #Raptors #NBA #acewolfLadies and gentlemen, Raptors handled business.  They did exactly what was advertised to us, they won the game with their defense.  Unbelievable victory on the road.  This young team needed a win like this to build confidence.  On my birthday too!

#WeTheNorth #nba #toronto https://t.co/FiB77f4BxrThe boos were warranted! Even Coach Udoka agrees with that. The Celtics 115-83 trouncing by the Toronto Raptors brought back all of the disappointment from last season. Mental toughness &amp; physical intensity are lacking. New coach-new players-new system.

He’s such a composed pro. Nobody wants to win more than @DeMar_DeRozan and he chose @chicagobulls. The “experts” were worried about the fit. Just watch.@Raptors using the same play for Anounby that they used for Valanciunas in the low post. NBA has changed so much.The @celtics are such gracious hosts they like passing the ball to the @Raptors 🙄@Raptors @FredVanVleet Nick Nurses coaching decision's are givin me headachesAs a result, Toronto has taken 20 more shots than the Celtics in the first half.

20.
