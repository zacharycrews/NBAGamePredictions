Does @scotttieee approve ? #WeTheNorth https://t.co/CjQ8eMOv0Z@LarryH718 @Makyle_Ice Raptors shot terrible and still almost got back into the game in the 4th  because of their defense. It was the first game back in Toronto in almost 2 years‚Ä¶ nerves were clearly an issue@Enigmaticjones @BarnesFanClub @Raptors Oh. Well TO is a little larger than my town lol@HiKifakCava @Raptors Sorry the raptors burst your bubble... Must have been a Ben and jerry kinda of night.@Raptors Tweet saved@Kayell1010 @JKenzie95 @Raptors @pskills43 @ScottBarnes561 hence maybe a GTJ trade for Ben Simmons to play at the 5? I thought about this because the defensive prowess of the team would then be insane. pretty much everything is switchable except FVVLet‚Äôs go Raptors @Raptors https://t.co/TeK0fVqFIe@LeoRautins @Matt__Devlin @Kayla_Grey @SamMitchellNBA @Nikki_Reyes @TSN_Sports @Raptors @dallasmavs @NBATVCanada @JLew1050 Hopefully no Luka magic today@DFS_D0E @Raptors @Floki5000 @NBA2K_MyTEAM W tweetRT: Raptors: Rook showed out last night.

#WeTheNorth https://t.co/shOlzddVBtGood win by the @Raptors tonight! Curious to see how they'll hold up against teams who follow the scouting reports on this young Raptors squad. #Raptors #NBA #acewolfLadies and gentlemen, Raptors handled business.  They did exactly what was advertised to us, they won the game with their defense.  Unbelievable victory on the road.  This young team needed a win like this to build confidence.  On my birthday too!

#WeTheNorth #nba #toronto https://t.co/FiB77f4BxrThe boos were warranted! Even Coach Udoka agrees with that. The Celtics 115-83 trouncing by the Toronto Raptors brought back all of the disappointment from last season. Mental toughness &amp; physical intensity are lacking. New coach-new players-new system.
