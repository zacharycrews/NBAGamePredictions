#NBA75@SpencerKeele I will offer the caveat that the league was totally different then. FA wasn't even a thing until 88. It wasn't really used as it is now until Shaq in 96. Also, the Utah Jazz franchise was less than half of the age it is now- and the pressure is different. 42 years- no rings.@anne2themax @utahjazz isn't there like a no fly list or something you can put her on?@utahjazz Then he should be good?Initial imaging determined that Azubuike suffered a subluxation in his right ankle. X-rays revealed no fractures. 
 
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) results will continue to be reviewed to determine Azubuike’s recovery process.Udoka Azubuike suffered a right ankle injury while on assignment with the Salt Lake City Stars in the team’s game last night against the Stockton Kings. He was examined by Utah Jazz and University of Utah medical personnel last night in Salt Lake City.Per the @utahjazz.

#GamblingTwitterThanks to a good friend of mine I marked something else off my bucket list. I was able to sit courtside at the Utah Jazz game last night. I truly believe that if you spend time and effort in helping others achieve their dreams, yours will automatically take place. https://t.co/KWtV2KNaKRI hope and believe Donovan Mitchell will play well into his prime with the Utah Jazz like Dame Lillard has done with the Portland Blazers. If Donovan breaks my heart and leaves, so be it.

But I’m optimistic.

I think he’s a different bread than Gordon Hayward or Deron Williams.@BensHoops @utahjazz Aaaaand hamstring@walkied88 @jsjjazzfan78 I choose to believe otherwise. I think Donovan Mitchell will play well into his prime with the Utah Jazz like Dame Lillard has done with the Blazers. If Donovan breaks my heart, so be it. But I’m optimistic.Doesn’t look like the @utahjazz plan to rest Mike Conley tonight on the back end of this back to back. 

Probably for the best after an up and down few weeks of play from the team.Top 10 dunks for the last week of November 💥

There's not as many eyes on him here as you think.@GrosshansKevin @jazzwithtaz The problem with that though is are you really satisfied with always being the bridesmaid and never the bride? That's who the Utah Jazz have been.

Even if the team decided to score in their own hoop they still wouldnt tie the game with so little clock@arnold_gatsinzi @utahjazz It has to be rigged, cuz theres this guy on tiktok who places bet like everyday and he gets so unlucky. He bet on a college team to lose by 12+. And with 10 seconds left they were up by like 13. And guess what the team decided to foul with 3 seconds left down by 13.@kslsports @BensHoops @utahjazz @ZoneSportsNet @fuboTV Long season though don't think we will have a lower point than the last 2 games.

Please Like and share, thank you https://t.co/oGm7fcCqG9@utahjazz Just simple : Donovan Mitchell must be trade, the weak link in the roster. And I don’t give a fuck about the Spida sexual. Low IQ basket and since he’s in the League cost us lot of game and playoff ones.The Utah Jazz lose another home game in the final seconds, as the New Orleans Pelicans win, 98-97. https://t.co/z18ZVnq7A2 https://t.co/FXTZ6iH2Xp@BuckleUpBoler @utahjazz Shakeup needed!!@GiffredS @BuckleUpBoler @utahjazz Gobert can’t make a shot that’s two feet away from the basket. 

9 points against the Pels… 9 points!@jsjjazzfan78 There isnno way the Utah Jazz would do a rebuild. They literally never do it.@WokeisaJoke78 @BuckleUpBoler @utahjazz Gobert is so efficient though. Mitchell on the other hand...The problem is the Utah Jazz aren’t playing well and the Utah Jazz have to fix their issues. https://t.co/ZAygUybsKz@GiffredS @BuckleUpBoler @utahjazz Right now I would trade Gobert and a first round pick for Ayton.

🙌@rmarkerm @bahrdental @BuckleUpBoler @utahjazz He didn't reply to my tweet. He can't defend Quin.Quin Snyder, Rudy Gobert, and Donovan Mitchell made no excuses after the @utahjazz suffered their worst loss of the season to the Pelicans. 

#takenote 

https://t.co/qjV7LZqnPTI'm going to try to save you all some keystrokes, breath, righteous indignation, and whatever else: Quin Snyder will still be the head coach of the Utah Jazz long after whatever the hell this funk is has passed. https://t.co/MJM8bJt9Bk@BuckleUpBoler @utahjazz Answer is this. Gobert super max and the fact we don’t have an enforcer coming off the bench means we are 2nd round trash for the next few years.Unbelievable this how they blew my ticket??? Fucking bums @utahjazz https://t.co/KfO3V9no5o@kohltonmiller @utahjazz So much truth to your statement - bogie was open in the corner - but do you think Don is going to pass and have someone else get the credit?@C_LIV5 @wak_jak @utahjazz @Tjonesonthenba Haha I’m sorry I gave that vibe off. I’m not okay with trading Donovan. He for sure my favorite player on the team. I have 3 of his jerseys which is 3 more then any other current Jazz player. I do think that Rudy contributes to winning more is all.@Fibby1123 @g_ham83 @SaltLakeJake Which, to me, based on my @utahjazz experience tonight, means... wear ‘em when you come in, do whatever you want when you get seated (and probably before).6 of 21 @spidadmitchell forces a layup against the double team that left @rudygobert27 wide open for a game sealing dunk. And it’s not like he didn’t see him- he faked the pass!!! Good thing it’s a long season for the @utahjazz to figure things out.SALT LAKE CITY (AP) — Devonte’ Graham made a go-ahead 3-pointer with 1.9 seconds to lift the New Orleans Pelicans to a 98-97 victory over the Utah Jazz on Friday night. https://t.co/CmUG4LboCU@bahrdental @BuckleUpBoler @utahjazz How so?@JazzJargon @utahjazz *on 6th drink. 
Yeah I’ll have 2 s as well@TNewm2215 @wak_jak @utahjazz @Tjonesonthenba All I’m getting from this is Jackson wants to trade Rudy. And Newm is okay with trading Donovan. You are both insane. Rudy is a once in a generation defender. Donovan is a FRANCHISE player. And your just willing to get rid of him. Absolutely. SILLY🏀 @utahjazz lose by one point against @PelicansNBA, 98-97. https://t.co/0ZJEPZps2PWow @utahjazz one point loss again.Devonte' Graham drained a clutch 3-pointer with 1.9 seconds remaining and Brandon Ingram scored 21 points to help the New Orleans Pelicans pull off a 98-97 upset win over the Utah Jazz on Friday night in Salt Lake City. https://t.co/NbrHMazjzjThe utah jazz are ass@jazzaholic32 @BuckleUpBoler @utahjazz This isn’t a good take.@utahjazz No thanks Football Day.@utahjazz This shit is painful. https://t.co/itGEeZMFZ1@BuckleUpBoler @utahjazz Horrible officiating.  The review of the goaltending that turned into a review last game…. Then the explanation was “the ball can’t be scored” or didn’t have an opportunity to be scored… what????  It was in the cylinder.  And tonight’s foul call was just atrocious. Keep Don’s 3Whine at the ref. Don’t get back in defense. Whine at the ref. Don’t move the ball. Whine at the ref. Making it very painful to invest emotionally in being a @utahjazz  fan.Rough game for #Blazers and zero rebounds for #DamianLillard . Let's get that next game at #utahjazz .. LETS GO #Blazers@wak_jak @utahjazz @Tjonesonthenba I suggest someone like Harrison Barnes. Barnes is a better defender but is still deadly from 3. We would be significantly improved defensively. Just watch out often Bojan is lost or stuck in mud.@bradtrader11 @utahjazz I’d get a refund or fraudulent charge on your card for that bs lol@wak_jak @utahjazz @Tjonesonthenba 2/2 Bojan is the guy you would move and could still bring back a significant piece to change the team. 18 mil isn’t a small contract so you’d expect to bring someone back who is established in the league. I would also say Clarkson fits that criteria but I really don’t want to 😂@dharper423 @utahjazz I was there and it sucked!@wak_jak @utahjazz @Tjonesonthenba 1/2 I think Donovan is playing poorly right now that is causing us to lose games. I think the team probably needs a wake up call but my suggestion would be to trade around the edges and not trade away the foundation of this team. Donovan and Rudy make the Jazz title contenders.Well, it was a stinker, but at least there’s a new Utah Jazz Podcast with Video! https://t.co/g1DWfhl1pe@wak_jak @utahjazz @Tjonesonthenba @TNewm2215 It’s interesting for sure. I don’t think anyone can say with any certainty that we’d be for sure better or worse.

For me personally, I feel it significantly increases our variability, and even though we’ve struggled thus far I still feel like we’re a title contender as is.@utahjazz Can’t wait for that L to come back tomorrow too.@dannatalks Lmao Utah jazz fans are punching air right now@TNewm2215 @utahjazz @Tjonesonthenba And I know that 100%, I know he is the best player on this squad. I’m just starting to come around to the belief that our entire system may need a shake up for us to reach our full potentialUtah Jazz 97 (Bojan Bogdanovic 23 pts) New Orleans Pelicans 98 (Brandon Ingram 21 pts), Golden State Warriors 118 (Stephen Curry 32 pts, Draymond Green 12 pts, 12 asists) Portland Trail Blazers 103 (Anfernee Simmons 19 pts)@Mac_Jazz I have lived through some really bad Utah Jazz seasons. Trust me: This group will figure it out. #TakeNotenot the utah jazz@wak_jak @utahjazz @Tjonesonthenba Yeah I hear your argument. Just have a hard time getting on board. Rudy is just a once in a lifetime talent. He might go down as the best defensive player of all time once he retires. I want him to be a Jazz man for life.Devonte’ Graham drained a clutch 3-pointer with 1.9 seconds remaining and Brandon Ingram scored 21 points to help the New Orleans Pelicans pull off a 98-97 upset win over the Utah Jazz. https://t.co/RR3BZuGLyzWhen the @Suns are serious about winning unlike the @utahjazz... https://t.co/2oXYrlezs0@TNewm2215 @utahjazz @Tjonesonthenba That it can be a positive.@TNewm2215 @utahjazz @Tjonesonthenba And I feel you 100%, I’m just trying to say that I believe if we shift our offensive and defensive systems from funneling everyone to Rudy and forcing Don to be our savior, is not quite a championship winning system, and if we can shift that defensive system as well as offensiveI don’t even care any more just peak at the right time @utahjazz@utahjazz This team sucks@heheuwuauausuus @pelsplzwin @utahjazz If we own them they need to give us our real team name back@wak_jak @utahjazz @Tjonesonthenba We haven’t had an NBA champion in the last like 10 years that wasn’t top 10 in both offense and defense. The Warriors are the best defensive team so far this season. I don’t know how the Jazz would be good defensively at all without Rudy. It would just make it really hard to win.@NickPlags @wak_jak @utahjazz @Tjonesonthenba @TNewm2215 I’m 100% in on JC@ZionsPels @utahjazz goated edit@utahjazz Clutch shots should be handed to @44Bojan in the future please.@utahjazz value loyalty over winning alwyas have, ways will,,
 and they don't want to make tough decisions. Jerry Slaon was right when he said "not many coaches lose 56 games and still keep their jobs." 

In Utah, you do. #Fireside@C_LIV5 @wak_jak @utahjazz @Tjonesonthenba @TNewm2215 We don’t diss on JC like that@wak_jak @utahjazz @Tjonesonthenba Yeah we just fundamentally believe different things haha I totally hear what you’re saying but I just don’t agree that moving more offensive will make the Jazz a better team. If we trade Rudy I think we’re the Suns of a few years ago. Trade Don you’re still in the playoffs.Utah Jazz are ass cheeks bro. Smh couldn’t even beat the Pels. That’s twice they lost to ass ass teams@BuckleUpBoler @utahjazz Good teams beat bad teams. See: Warriors, Golden State and Suns, Phoenix. 

This is not a good team right now. Something is definitely wrong.@utahjazz no end to this crap !!!!!!@CoolKaneMVP @utahjazz As a jazz fan I have to admit this as a WToday would eb a good day for the @utahjazz to fire Quin Snyder. He isn't Jerry Sloan. Give this team to Alex Jensen.@TNewm2215 @utahjazz @Tjonesonthenba And I understand this completely. I am completely content with us keeping this roster and I do believe that we can win a championship as currently constructed. I’m just trying to weigh all options and I believe that our best opportunity to improve the roster is in using Rudy andWould love to see some twitter listening in on my play by play of the Utah Jazz on @Colorcastapp would love to get a coo commentator. And people can give us their hot takes in the hot seat.@BuckleUpBoler @utahjazz Looks like we feel over confident that we can just always turn it on when it matters. And the Jazz losing our final chance off a turnover felt like summed up this whole game. On to the next one... https://t.co/WrBrhXc5dm🇦🇺 12 points, 5 rebounds and 1 assist for old mate @joeingles7 against the Pelicans 🇦🇺

@utahjazz #TakeNote #NBA75 https://t.co/rJssa7Sds4@BuckleUpBoler @utahjazz Bogey is 2-0 in game winners. If it ain’t broke don’t fix it!@benjamingaines "I just wonder if the game hasn't passed Coach Saban by, and if it has then by golly we better cut him loose now. Just look what keeping a coach did to the Utah Jazz."@BuckleUpBoler @utahjazz Don’t do iso ball when in crunch time. The Utah Jazz are 5-6 in their last 11 games, and 3-4 AT HOME. They have lost to the Magic, Pacers, Grizzlies and Pelicans who all have sub .500 records. Pitching this team as a contender right now is a very tough sell and laughableUtah jazz messed up everything 😡😡We losing back to back. With a lost to the pels...please make a comeback #utahjazz@TNewm2215 @utahjazz @Tjonesonthenba IMO if we rebuild this roster to force the offense to run through Donovan as a playmaker rather than a scorer allows for much more opportunity for everyone on the squad, as well as Don as a 20ppg scorer@kslsports @utahjazz @PelicansNBA This sucks@wak_jak @utahjazz @Tjonesonthenba I mean…Memphis is 9-10 and OKC is 6-13 right? When is the last time either team made it to the second round? Jazz have consistently been a good team and while they’ve lacked success in the playoffs they still make it and have won playoff series under with Rudy.@TNewm2215 @utahjazz @Tjonesonthenba And that’s the big problem I have with this trade, I am not actively looking to trade Rudy, and if you think that you’ve analyzed incorrectly. I am more willing to rebuild through Donovan than I am Rudy, because imo to peak w Rudy on the roster needs an all time offensive squad.@tc91585 @OwainBanks @utahjazz This is exactly my thoughts too spot on. Run something. Move the ball. Don’t just dribble the clock out and rush a panic shotToday’s summary:

Why do I care more than they do and I don’t make 40 mill a year? We can’t even beat the worst teams in the east in the west and every team knows that about us. Our team is better than last year’s team and their performance is hideous@utahjazz Jazz look uninterested and are doing too much isolation offense - not swinging the ball “blender” style which is the key to success. They are playing down to the level of every inferior team right nowYou could be the greatest, you can be the best

Pls resolve this issue as soon as possible@TNewm2215 @utahjazz @Tjonesonthenba My main thought process behind all of this is Memphis and OKC have repped middle tier centers for years, at 25 million less a year than Rudy, and understanding the differences and are we supposed to just believe that a defensive first center at that cost is the best thing for us?@tc91585 @OwainBanks @utahjazz What a pathetic showing all around.Both @celtics and @utahjazz blew my ticket 🤦🏽‍♂️😒 again tho out of 14 teams 2 lost 🙄@wak_jak @utahjazz @Tjonesonthenba I mean Donovan didn’t just shoot poorly. He made mental mistake after mental mistake tonight. Why not trade Don and keep literally one of the best defensively players of all time? No team that is all offense and no defense win the title. Warriors are #1 in defense so far. 16-2.@NBA @utahjazz Traveled before that shot. Missed callCan’t wait to see this. New segment of the Utah Jazz Podcast with Video™? https://t.co/kQkznXUUFn@wak_jak @utahjazz @Tjonesonthenba @TNewm2215 Just did bb. Ingram does not Intrigue me in the slightest. He’s a taller JC@sportsiren @utahjazz The lack of effort is hard to defend!

They looked like they all had way too much stuffing yesterday... extra gravy.@iKasey @utahjazz I just rushed it my g but it still makes sense thoooooo@TNewm2215 @wak_jak @utahjazz @Tjonesonthenba To say he’s Rudy is our best player let alone saying it’s not even close w Donovan is asinine 
Donovan is the franchise. Not taking away from what Rudy is/has done but it’s all in on Don@builtdif_3000 @utahjazz It’s ‘AN ORGAN’.  An.@utahjazz Jazz in playoffs mode already@theScore @utahjazz So much control the Jazz lost@C_LIV5 @utahjazz @Tjonesonthenba @TNewm2215 Read all my responses plz and then talk w me@utahjazz @PodiumHQ Playing like they care should be required! Time for a shakeup of some sort.@TNewm2215 @utahjazz @Tjonesonthenba Into a defensive prowess so long as we put together the right system for defense to work with the squad we have.Bogey-man with 5 threes 😱

#PerformanceLeader | @UofUHealth https://t.co/xfw2Yn9JLTWe’ve seen this before.@utahjazz Mitchell’s heroic 3-ball disallowed due to a Herbert Jones foul before the shot. Pelicans control the final seconds and Devonte Graham hits the game winner. 4th home loss after just 5 last season. Answers needed. #JazzNation #TakeNote@TNewm2215 @utahjazz @Tjonesonthenba Yes Ingram is a top 30 player, who’s emphasis is on the offensive side of the ball, which to mean alleviates more of the offensive responsibilities from Donovan than any other player on the jazz. Which to me make our entire offense better. I am Williams to sacrifice 20% defensive📹| Bogey with the buckets 🎯

#TakeNote | @ZionsBank https://t.co/jZlC67U4Ak@sportsiren @utahjazz Is this a team full of rookies? My god, this quote is an indictment on the entire roster. Zero commitment or determination. This team is a joke!@NBASarah So you think I'm joking?  Donovan Mitchbrick is not a clutch shooter .. He's scared!!! Do you need my advice for the Utah Jazz? I'm waiting for your reply....@utahjazz @ZionsBank Omg we are so happy about thisJust avoid utah jazz for now... They killed me against ja morant team the other dsy... Even avoid lakers too https://t.co/L3PvFE1uLr@utahjazz why can’t y’all beat bum ass teams?!?Well it is time for a Twitter break for a moment so I don’t get to upset over the @utahjazz stupid loss and watch @Showtime #JFKREVISITEDTHROUGHTHELOOKINGGLASS@wak_jak @utahjazz @Tjonesonthenba Is Ingram a top 50 player? I think he’s probably top 30 at best. Rudy is a for sure top 20 player and probably a top 15 player. Valancuinas is like top 100? Just a one sided trade if you involve Rudy in it I feel like.I’ve slowly grown a hatred towards the Utah Jazz… and I think it all stems from Mitchell vs. Simmons.

The rest is history. I hope that team loses forever. https://t.co/hOEeg9CFZO@NufcJohnson @Coreboar @NBA @PelicansNBA @utahjazz Jazz is originally New Orleans franchise and the name makes way more sense here.

It’s getting hard to watch@utahjazz @ZionsBank Herb better@wak_jak @utahjazz @Tjonesonthenba We’re still the number 1 offense in the NBA right now even with this horrible start. Idk man I just really don’t get how trading away Rudy would help at all. Even if we are a little bit better offensively how does losing Rudy make us better?YOU’LL NEVER SUCCEED UNTIL YOU GIVE OUR NAME BACK HEAUX @utahjazz@tc91585 @OwainBanks @utahjazz jazz are notoriously bad at run the clock iso plays under QS.  They flat-out suck at them.   this game was lost in the second and third quarters though, this team doesn't give the effort it gave last year.  they miss open shots and cry about the refs and stop playing smart ball@utahjazz Pathetic📹| Bojan: 23p | 4r | 1a | 1s

#NBA@KohlNelson @utahjazz Was just going to have one but decided to go with two after that 😂@utahjazz maybe this guy will show up...Quin Snyder was pretty ardent on one point: the ball is not moving, the ball needs to start moving, and this team collectively needs to start figuring out what it wants.

Strong stuff from the Utah Jazz head coachJazz coach Quin Snyder: “We know how we need to play, it’s just a matter of us executing it…how we come out tomorrow is up to us.” 
Says team needs Level of commitment and determination to play (that way) on both ends of the court. @utahjazzI fuckn hate the Utah jazz@wak_jak @utahjazz @Tjonesonthenba Btw I’m on board for the Jazz making a trade. Literally would be open to hearing about trading anyone on the roster except for Rudy. He’s our best player and it’s not particularly close.Now I have to drink unhappily, thanks @utahjazzDeath to the Utah Jazz@SincerelyKammm @utahjazz Had that man in jail bruh😂@wak_jak @utahjazz @Tjonesonthenba If we trade Rudy we’ll never win a game.The theme song for the 2021 #UtahJazz.

@TNewm2215Does anyone know where I can find a mirror big enough for about 20 people to look into at the same time? I’d like to gift it to the @utahjazz for #BlackFriday@brucepitcher @utahjazz Pels are better than what people think they are almost every game they lost they had the game to the last 2 minutes with either side winning plus apparently the last two years the pels kinda own the jazz for some reason@OwainBanks @utahjazz I mean, at least I think it's on Quin. I doubt Don is highjacking all those plays. Seems the team is told to get out of the way, and Don gets told to make a play. Sometimes the better play is for everyone to move around, and Don hit the open guy, but with nobody moving...Utah Jazz are so painful to watch. Got alot to figure out this szn man #TakeNote@utahjazz Embarrassing as hellLMFAOOOOOOOO @utahjazz https://t.co/dRcadSL8nj@Aggiesalltheway @utahjazz Not good at all.@utahjazz Dang we suck this year LMAO.

#TheGamePlan#utahjazz why is Donovan shooting the last 3 point shot when he shots less than 30%. 28.6% tonight? Boggie was 56%????????@OwainBanks @utahjazz What I don't get is they don't even have a play drawn up.  Every time it's just give the ball to Mitchell, let him dribble 20 seconds, and see what he comes up with, all while being triple teamed. Nobody else moves because they know the play is run the clock and let Don shoot@utahjazz Imagine losing to the Pelicans 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣@utahjazz what is our luck@utahjazz Jazz brass thinking about those max Gobert and Mitchell contract now 👇🏻 https://t.co/Epkaqy3teB@utahjazz Of all teams, Pelicans??? 😡😡😡🤬@utahjazz r bad@ArthurRussoYT1 @utahjazz Because Mitchell is the king of the stupid.@utahjazz your a joke I’m so trued of cheering for you I can’t believe you lost at home to the pelicans you should be embarrassed and pay people to come watch this Garbage of a teamThe Utah Jazz are 5-6 in their last 11 games, and 3-4 AT HOME. They have lost to the Magic, Pacers, Grizzlies and Pelicans who all have sub .500 records. Pitching this team as a contender right now is a very tough sell.The @utahjazz love playing the enabler this year. 🤦‍♂️ https://t.co/N1wJayoYdd@WokeisaJoke78 @utahjazz they've already been exposed last year btw, blew a 20 pts lead to a Clippers less Kawhi lol@utahjazz This is going to be a rough season huh@utahjazz Please no@utahjazz The Pelicans are one of those teams that fall into the “If you lose to this team you look really stupid” category. We look really stupid right now.@TyNOLA5 @utahjazz I got you fam https://t.co/qkF7ovXdtT@utahjazz Hahahahhahahahah@utahjazz FIGURE IT OUT@utahjazz Man, now I know how that Kings fan felt... https://t.co/UGna3kWIGS@Liu_James @utahjazz 5-6 in the last 11 games
not good@utahjazz And again Mitchell trying to be hero when bogi was wide open in the corner I just don’t get it@utahjazz Donovan is the least clutch player in the league. So bad seeing him lose all these close games. Bogey and Conley were hot, give them the ball ffs@utahjazz Herb JonesOn Jesus y’all trash @utahjazz@utahjazz most overrated player in the league: Donovan Shot chuckler Mitchell@utahjazz Same story as the Grizzlies game. No excuse to lose this game and please don’t give Mitchell the last shot if he’s having a bad night. Really really awful couple of performances from the Jazz.@utahjazz Would love to hear from all the Jazz fans that flooded Twitter with dumb tweets when the Jazz were the only undefeated team in the NBA…@utahjazz Love* idk why it auto corrected to past tense 🤦‍♂️😂😂@utahjazz New coach please@utahjazz y’all just blew my entire parlay thanks for choking to the pels🙏🏼Betting on the #NBA is a joke
-900 Utah Jazz lose to the 4-16 Pelicans.@utahjazz are 23% through the szn with a record of (12-7)

https://t.co/mpEbGRrx6Y@NBA @utahjazz Jazz Rarely bring their full effort to 4 qtr of a game. They are lackluster. playing down to their opponents and even down below. Loss to the magic and the grizzlies?  could’ve won 1 Miami game and the Pacers. Seems like I want the Jazz to win more than they do themselves@NBA @utahjazz Nice one😊O’Neal goes out of the game and the @utahjazz give up back to back layups.  This team has a really long way to go to being able to compete for a championship.  You can’t put a struggling New Orleans away.  There’s time.  But this is hard to watch@NBA @utahjazz get me a smoothie!!!!!!@NBA @utahjazz Jazz got Miami colored type of jerseys@NBA @utahjazz Over pliz@gilpedersen @SharkeezLS @utahjazz @Hamdogg guy in the middle looks extremely rapey@NBA @utahjazz Overrated team so who cares“What’s it like watching the Utah Jazz this season?” https://t.co/XuTzuO3cRQNew Orleans Pelicans vs. Utah Jazz: Play-by-play, highlights and reactions https://t.co/5lK0fqAUbCWith 5:00 left to play in the third quarter, the @utahjazz lead the @PelicansNBA 61-59.
