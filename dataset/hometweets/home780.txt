I hope Lamelo leaves asapIDC what anyone says I expect a win Tonight @hornets nothing elseDisrespect is real! @hornets https://t.co/fePIgdiSFMCharlotte organization &amp; media: success is making the play in vs trying to win it all…….also Charlotte organization &amp; media: “our development system made LaMelo be in the Rising Star”.   🤦🏻‍♀️ @hornets y’all gotta do betterThe man is trying to change a whole culture in a franchise that has had nothing for a long time if not ever but can’t even be given that, let him play and if he makes mistakes…….He will learn and grow from it @hornets @MELOD1P #shouldvebeenanAllStarNBA Basketball Game Betting Picks Simulator: 2/4/2022 7:10 PM ET - Cleveland Cavaliers vs. Charlotte Hornets - YOU CAN RUN THE GAME SIMULATION FOR FREE HERE: https://t.co/sIDi93vIW2 #nba #sportsbetting #freepicks #cappertek@Eternity9 @hornets I saw that you liked his tweet earlier the man literally just responded to me saying he love this team meaning he loves how Melo and Miles plays it probably reminds him of Gary Payton throwing the alley hoops to Sean Kemp.@Eternity9 @hornets Even Sonics legendary coach George Karl is heated with the NBA snubbing Melo and Miles he even responded to me and other upset Hornets fans.@antjams @hornets I see your point.@HornetsOnBally #FIREBORREGO

What if they did vote, en masse? Wouldn't those numbers most likely exceed or equal the LeBron numbers? Would the NBA accept that ... what can of precedent would that set? Can Social Media truly ever have that kind of sway?1-10 East Rankings: only team without at least one AllStar. 

Charlotte Hornets 

Im sick of this shit tbh@WhistleSports @TheHoopCentral @spurs @DejounteMurray @MELOD1P Melo he has team in a higher seed and there in play off conversation also Murray is the main player for hes team , if y’all watch Charlotte basketball he isn’t the #1 option he’s coach is dumb af , and any hornet fan can vouch for meI usually don't care about all star picks, awards etc. Not at all. With that being said, the fact the @HornetsPR @hornets didn't get an All Star is pure BS. It will serve as great motivation though for the rest of the season. Let's go!@Bulls_Jay @ABtheHero Nobody wanting to watch Vanvleet either tbh #FIREBORREGO #FIREMITCH trash @hornets organization sabotaging its players @NBA @NBAonTNT @ESPNNBA with a trash All Star productRN 👐🏾

Unacceptable @hornets sabotaging it's own players 
Jordan going to run this team back to obscurity yet againWe were ROBBED.😡 #CharlotteHornets https://t.co/egjzPd6E8E@hornets #AllFly Do yall think because we are a little better than Our coaching staff Set #20 for this Homestand... Just saying...Charlotte @Hornets Beat Writer @rodboone talks Lamelo and Miles snub from the All-Star Game https://t.co/NfVMPgrp9c #CSL@Nuclearisfuture @jonruns4fun @TheJacksonDylan Hell, it was a long time ago, but the original Charlotte Hornets had the NBA's best market. 9 straight years of sellouts with over 23,000 fans per game, and they had at least one All-star in 8 out of 9 games (back when Charlotte was much smaller).Orlando sends Desmond Bane and Nemanja Bjelica to the Charlotte Hornets for Jared Butler, Naz Reid and a 2022 MEM 2nd rounder.@BrotherEDEN @DKM_Sports @hornets So what your saying is that NBA decided that let’s not allow one of the most popular players in the league in the showcase of stars… by discarding his votes that fans casted??? So your saying the league committed voter fraud??@hornets Y’all wrong for this!. @jemelehill https://t.co/LrVnzv9bZw@Italiag777 @Eternity9 @hornets If they don't come to an agreement in summer ‘23 with a player of his profile, it's going to be hell going into the next season with the uncertainty hanging over their head. If Lamelo declines that kind of money, then the writings on the wallIf this Allstar Snub don’t motivate the @hornets I don’t know what will. We gotta go crazy second half of the season and kill it in the playoffs..@Italiag777 @RobespierreMil2 @hornets Key word is “can,” but this doesn’t mean they “will.” Pay attention to how this franchise operates. #lowbudget@Italiag777 @hornets They will not give him max. Tonight has sealed the deal for me &amp; my thoughts of this franchise &amp; how they operate. It’s been in our faces all along. I’m no longer blind.@Eternity9 @hornets Sadly I see the entire NBA having hatered for Melo like they do Lonzo and Gelo we have to be realistic the only the three of them will be respected for their talent if they formed their own league. Ice Cube Big 3 would love to have them especially Lamelo. I am boycotting the NBA@danny3thompson @DKM_Sports @hornets So. His followers didn't  vote? Or did their votes get discarded? And then there's the Gelo and Zo fans, too. There's something "off" about all of this.@RobespierreMil2 @Eternity9 @hornets Either way we can match any other teams offer when he’s a restricted free agent. So we can give him the most money.The @hornets announcer should be the announcer for the NBA All Star game . @NBA pleaaaseeee make this happen !!HEAT at SPURS | FULL GAME HIGHLIGHTS | February 3, 2022 #Charlotte #Hornets #NBA Video: https://t.co/PlDXzAxwJu@Italiag777 @Eternity9 @hornets We’ve seen more than enough examples of how money can't bail out these poorly run franchises. And Charlotte’s only advantage is the Supermax, but a player must make All - NBA before they can qualify. How's he going to achieve that while playing for JB?Are you kidding me @NBA ????? Really you dont pick @MELOD1P and @MilesBridges ????? You and your selection system are very very VEEEERY creazy… 

Go @hornets !!! #AllFly @LosHornetsArg @HornetsOnBally @hornetslatino @SuperfanHornets @Hornets_allfly @HornetsBA @HornetsNationCPThese 2 will get their day. Its just not going to be with the the Charlotte Hornets. https://t.co/X8tLnWCKqG@banslovesmom @SuperfanHornets Hornets are the only winning team w/o representation in the entire league, and if #NBA wants to keep basketball viable in Charlotte, adding him would be wise because I guarantee those players believe that they're playing for an outpost"INJURY UPDATE: Hornets vs Clippers 2/5 - Cody Zeller (R hand surgery) is PROBABLE, Tony …"

Yea we definitely turning up the second half of the season. Don’t be surprise we make a run like Atlanta Hawks did last year !@CoachKarl22 @hornets Ball 🤷🏻‍♂️@themichaelLosh @MilesBridges @MELOD1P @hornets Smh they just haters@mateo_a52 @MilesBridges @MELOD1P That’s why the @hornets have 0@velmafanaccount @hornets Lmao just noticed this.

Let’s get that dub!!! #AllFly@CoachKarl22 @hornets So do the Sonics!@BarracosoKen @hornets They have to wait for their front office orders on what to say. *joke but probably true*@MiamiHEAT Great bounce back game now off to @hornets Thatz will be a dog fight 🔥The @hornets deserve an All Star!!@trayNTP @WhichCarolina @RichieRandall I’m trying to understand why Mo Bamba would be a more sure-fire target over Poeltl. Charlotte isn’t going to be “elite” with any of these trades. They need to raise their floor. The Hornets lack an interior defensive presence and JP provides that. Bamba is more of a project.@DrunkUncleP @NBA @hornets This year he would borderline make it over miles bridges if it was up to me cuz bridges been cooking@hornets By now you should be salty as hell. But not even a single rant for lamelo nor miles not making it into the all star game.New to Twitter I wanna be a part of the @nbatopshot community! 😃 Current @hornets full team set owner!@foreverbrandnew @NBA @hornets Nah not over LameloI really don’t get how the @hornets don’t have 1 all star🤔@DrunkUncleP @NBA @hornets Middleton lowkey aint really deserve to be on all star team either 🙃the charlotte hornets should have an all-starHow does the @NBA disrespect the #1 offense of the @hornets by omitting not one but BOTH @MELOD1P &amp; @MilesBridges that’s a absolute shame! Snubbed for sure #AllFly@hornets it’s time to give @GeloBall03 a chance 🔥🔥🔥@Eternity9 @hornets I doubt he goes anywhere. We can and will give him a max deali think the charlotte hornets will have an all star. not every voted allstar will be healthy on 2.20.22 #NBAAllStar@SDot150 @hornets I feel you!!!@Eternity9 @hornets It’s damn shame because you a real one! Also Melo lack of major support from his entire Hornets organization was/is unforgivable. They dropped the ball no pun intended and with Miles they’ve basically burned bridges pun intended smh. So disappointed 😒@TBoneWFNZ @JayBilas @thorku @hornets 6am. @macwfnz rant on #NBAAllStar selections. Should be epic.Darius Garland has been ruled OUT for tomorrows contest against the Charlotte Hornets. He did do a slight practice with the team but nothing major. Expect him to be in the lineup next week. https://t.co/MsxLSu0B78@TheJacksonDylan Hopefully this fuels the fire that the Charlotte Hornets are the only team in the Eastern Conference playoff picture to play in the NBA Finals.I'm actually glad that @hornets player got snubbed, I want them to play out this season with a chip on their shoulder. @ashahahmadi @HornetsOnBallyMac Attack Friday

Don't talk to me about snub like u didnt see every game JB play with his minutes and defend his ass.

This re the minutes during the All star strech...Its crazy his minutes went up after the All star vote is finished i wonder why https://t.co/B53X6ymaVp@MELOD1P If you play the rising stars game I’m burning my Melo ball jersey and shoes. If you’re not good for the all star game then you’re not good for the rising stars. @nba Melo isn’t play so y’all can choke on a big black d*ck @hornets it’s JB’s faultLaMelo’s time with the @hornets will be a “short” chapter in his career but he will accomplish the most when he leaves here at the end of his rookie contract. I’m saying this as a hornets fan since childhood.@FanOfHomeState One more season, make or break. The Hornets are improved, but so is the east. Like vastly improved. So March last year we were the 4 seed, this March we’ll be lucky to be the 8 seed. Just Charlotte luck. Coaching won’t change the lack of needed talent.Check out 2020 LaMelo Ball Concourse Select Hornets #63 Pack Fresh! #CharlotteHornets https://t.co/Byao0zKg3V via @eBay@hornets @HornetsPR this your  fought for not promoting LaMelo and Miles better. And y'all did this so you don't have to pay them one day 🤷🏽‍♀️ https://t.co/i82xkp3pFO@JonesOnTheNBA I think Charlotte has to be seen more on the national stage. Melo is well known, but the Hornets just need more TV time.Easily the Charlotte Hornet https://t.co/vpNgrO7qsLHey @StubHub fam how about a discount code to support my @hornets since we got ALL-STAR game snubbed!! #allflyJust seeing @NBAAllStar roster after reserves were picked. How the BLOODY HELL did @hornets @MELOD1P not make it?! And @spurs @DejounteMurray? Both will likely be named to the team due to injuries or guys opting out, but that’s criminal. #NBA #NBA75 #NBAAllStar #AllFly #PorVidaLaMelo got 33 right now 🔥

What a joke!!! That’s cool @NBA We know what we have with our @hornets #allfly #wewererobbed@TorontoDame @Raptors @FredVanVleet It would be nice to have @pskills43 there but one of the @hornets (LaMelo or Bridges) will be the injury replacement.🤷🏽‍♂️The Charlotte Hornets are the only current playoff team without an All-Star. It's not an accident, it's the media's hatred for Lavar Ball. Nothing against Van Fleet but Melo's numbers are better and his team has more wins. This is a hit.@hornets Those last two possessions show us how much we need to improve. We are a good team. Not always a good team when it is possession by possession.@macwfnz The Hornets don’t bring the Commish anything to his table. Charlotte is a stepchild@sixringsofsteeI Based on who could get the @Hornets to the another level:
-Myles Turner 👍👍Yes 
-Christian Wood 👎👎 No 
-Jakob Poeltl 👍👎No
-Mo Bamba 👍👍Yes
-Richaun Holmes 👍👍Yes@hornets got robbed…what else is new?!🤬🙄🙄🙄 WTF??!

Trash organization@MELOD1P @MilesBridges should have made it to the All Star game. No @hornets representation is a SNUB #nba #NBAAIIStar 🛸🕺🦍Out o all 10 teams in the playoff/play-in race, the Charlotte Hornets are the only team without an all star. Disrespectful.@DJsRawUncutTru1 @hornets I tell ya!LaMelo Ball's 38 points weren't enough to lead the Charlotte Hornets to a much-needed win. They can't afford to waste any more of his brilliant performances.

Always. Just move the team @NBA. Man I miss the old days of the @hornets when we got the respect we deserved. https://t.co/HGrTvVwAhwI'm disappointed that my buddy @MilesBridges one of the finest people and basketball players I know isn't in the NBA All-Star game.

Neither Miles Bridges or LaMelo Ball were named to the All-Star team. #Hornets #NBAAIIStar https://t.co/f5vF2nnqBU@js3kbullies Not surprised. @hornets are the most disrespected team in the league. Always.The James Borrego defenders are mighty quiet right now...... What's the next excuse....🤷🏿‍♂️#allfly @hornetsLamelo Ball should have gotten on the all star team over Fred Vanvleet! Lamelo been putting up better numbers and the Hornets have a better record than the Raptors #NBAAllStar @nba @hornetsThe Charlotte Hornets are the only team with a winning record to not have an all star this season 🤨No @hornets named as #AllStarGame reserves.  @MELOD1P will be part of the Rising Stars game.

We'll see you in the Rising Star exhibition ... 

@Hornets . @MELOD1P . @NBAAllStar . @NBA https://t.co/9mQymlsQ3UI’m not even a @hornets fan but them not having one all star is INSANE. This is supposed to be a game for highlights and Ball &amp; Bridges are more exciting than a few of those guysNo @hornets wtf https://t.co/cYB8KTZhub https://t.co/wRSkHpbhZbNo Charlotte Hornet will be playing in the all-star game... for now.

Injury replacements could happen.It was obvious @hornets and Borrego wanted Hayward and Rozier their highest paid no-shows to be in the AllStar game.  This what happens when a coach doesn’t respect young players!The Charlotte Hornets are the only team in the Eastern Conference playoff picture not represented at the All-Star game.I like Jayson Tatum and Middleton as much as the next guy, but Miles Bridges and Jarrett Allen were snubbed! #NBAAIIStar #Charlotte #Cavs #Hornets #ClevelandThe Charlotte Hornets get ZERO respect. https://t.co/ymv1vvVXd6I’m sorry but Harden should not be an AllStar @hornets @MELOD1P should have that spot and @MiamiHEAT @raf_tyler should have Jimmys spot #NBAAllStar #AllFly #HeatCultureWin the championship this season to prove 'em wrong. @MilesBridges @MELOD1P @T_Rozzay3 @Hornets #AllFly@ShamsCharania This is Lames Borrego’s fault @hornets https://t.co/bjSTNPjo7J@CyrusOnTWR @hornets They got a couple young first-timers! 😃

But no Melo/RTB… 😔@ringernba Holy crap. No Hornets? Ball and Bridges deserved to make it. Harden and Tatum are playing terribly and their teams are underachieving. But hey, they have big names playing for big market teams. If they were in Charlotte neither would even be considered.the nba actually hates the charlotte hornets and it goes to show@RSPNonRNC @hornets NBA not letting young players shine and going with a bunch of the #USUAL guys again? 🥱Well Charlotte, we have to enjoy #LaMelo while we can because he is OUT OF CHARLOTTE AS SOON AS POSSIBLE! #Hornets #AllFlyThe Charlotte Hornets haven’t had an NBA All-Star since Kemba Walker.  https://t.co/8wdxIKX721@SweetCheeks9296 @hornets They have to replace Durant so hopefully one of them will get picked.@hornets they sleepin on us👀Just heard Draymond Greene expecting @MilesBridges to be picked and Kenny Smith mentioning Lamelo, unfortunately they werent but good love to @hornets players! @NBAonTNT @CrownClubCLTNot a single member of the @hornets?

Someone hold @CyrusOnTWR back https://t.co/edS3nOVDEgSnubbed @hornetsNo Charlotte Hornets that’s wiiiiiild…LaMelo and Miles got SNUBBED!

Hopefully this gives them a damn chip on their shoulder (we play Cleveland tomorrow 👀)
