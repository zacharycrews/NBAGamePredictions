Things Holly says/does that I (along with Jazz nation) despise:
1) praising Chris Paul 
2) complimenting Lakers and their players for overcoming adversity and work ethic
3) gushing over Golden State Warriors

We don’t want to hear it Holly! #knowyouraudienceIn December I worked my last game with the Golden State Warriors Group Sales Team. Without a doubt the last five years with the Dubs has played a critical role in my professional and personal growth.

More exciting personal news coming soon!

And it’s just amazing to see the 1-1 defense other star players get.

The cool part was that he was drafted in 1984 which is the best draft class ever imo. Super nice guy who I'm sure I annoyed talking about the history of 1980s NBAOnly reason I’m not in full depression mode is the @49ers distraction. Just like when niners went 3-5 @warriors distracted me to the max.
