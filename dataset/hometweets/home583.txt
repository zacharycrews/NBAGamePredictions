Sign the man@celtics He was ur 3rd best player SMH@WalshJesuitMBB @WalshJesuit @WJ_Warriors @WJsuperfans2020 Guessing Oates is nicknamed The Truth after Paul Pierce, Boston Celtics hall of famer@patsfan1122 @stellarct @badbeatbeans @celtics He's also not the solution.@Kudaluv3 @Celtics_George @patsfan1122 @badbeatbeans @celtics People are just retarted. If teams have a consistent problem with two different coaches in two years then they blame the coach we have now LMAO.@celtics Waive Tatum too@blahblablah124 @patsfan1122 @badbeatbeans @celtics No you think you know what a nba head coach is like LMAO@celtics Boogie?

Not to keep in mind just Fournier alone scored 15+ on his head in like 16 minutes! Defense ain't there either except for THE TIME LORD@nyknicks @WorldWideWob @EvanFourmizz He had the @celtics screaming ‚Äúsacrebleu‚Äù!!@celtics Sources?@stellarct @BFowlz @Yrnkeem @celtics He is injured right now@TerryFranconia @celtics 1 year of quarantine wasn‚Äôt enough for some.@celtics Just shut up atp@stellarct @BFowlz @JBLUVSEDANDARI @Yrnkeem @celtics Exactly. They keep him around for defense they say@celtics JJ Reddick incoming@JBLUVSEDANDARI @stellarct @Yrnkeem @celtics And Jaylen is to contributing 16 points to that L then game before scored 51.@espn_macmahon @wojespn I love Moses Brown ‚Ä¶ was spewing the @celtics offloaded him ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è@stellarct @celtics I can't believe Bucks waived Boogie man, we signed 3 mid players and dumped him but hey im not the gm, they might get sumn better. I hope y'all can get boogie he is still great and tuff.@Caleedad @stellarct @celtics Definitely Boogie for Enes@Celtics_George @patsfan1122 @stellarct @badbeatbeans @celtics They were bad last year as well and still have some of the same issues. First It was Kyrie, then Kemba, then they need to split up Jayson and Jaylen. There's a team issue they need to fix. How about getting another real big and releasing Freedom, what does he bring to the table.And please subscribe don‚Äôt worry I will make @celtics videos and all the rest of the teams! Celtics video coming soon. https://t.co/iuU4JURcIM@RodTheGod30 @Robert_Jones44 @rattledrush @celtics Nah you were right the first time. Waive him@adamjones985 trade the @celtics team.

You pounce on him any chance you get. Honestly, it's pathetic. You get mad when people defend him, yet you won't acknowledge the many people who hate on him Like You.
