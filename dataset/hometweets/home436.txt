The bubble worked because it was the exception, not the rule.@trailblazers @hornets @ROOTSPORTS_NW @RipCityRadio620 For my mental well-being, pls win@veedub77 @trailblazers I think this is less a problem of the leagues not caring and more evidence of the massive logistical challenges associated with balancing the physical health of players, fans and other personnel with the economic health of the individual teams and the league as a whole.@trailblazers @hornets @ROOTSPORTS_NW @RipCityRadio620 Big dubs tonight I know itConsensus Line Move:

Dame time.@theta444 @trailblazers thank you! really appreciate this.@Jonathan_Maus @trailblazers Anywayyyyys you're probably ok to go but I would double mask and not take off mask to eat or drink. The damn thing shouldn't be happening, she will only shut events down once cases have already skyrocketed, dumb.@Jonathan_Maus @trailblazers I was disappointed by how many people weren't wearing masks when I attended in early November. Everyone had masks but took them off as soon as they got to their seats, didn't cover their noses, etc. To Blazers credit, they did have employees to monitor.@Jonathan_Maus @trailblazers every day the risk is higher. I'd say go today but not in 2 weeks?@Jonathan_Maus @trailblazers Fwiw the state compared us to DK today in terms of population, immunity, etc. They didn't point out DK is shutting down big events üôÉ@Jonathan_Maus @trailblazers We're going to the nutcracker tomorrow but it's obviously masked, vaxed, were getting tests right beforehand, and sedate crowd/no eating drinking...@Jonathan_Maus @trailblazers It's take a numbers game now. The gov should have shut down larger gatherings today. But it's not politically expedient so they're just pushing more boosters. Statistically, the fact the gathering is happening is the problem.@Jonathan_Maus @trailblazers On the individual level you yourself are statistically fairly safe. 
Your chances of all being safe get a little slimmer when you count the other 4 in your household if you get it.
Your chances of getting it are higher because of casual crowd eating and drinking and yelling@Jonathan_Maus @trailblazers Keep your mask on.NBA üá∫üá∏
