I'm meaning reducing capacity or eliminating fam attendance at games. The games would still be played, just with less fans.@trailblazers @hornets @ROOTSPORTS_NW @RipCityRadio620 I don't have @ROOTSPORTS_NW and I can't watch anymore. I'm so sad. Also, no BoomShack-a-Lack-a! It's too sad! No Blazers TV, No Boom. 😨😢🙁@jelanigreenidge @trailblazers I know it's more complex than I'm making it, but it just feels disingenuous to be focusing on the players health when that's a very small percentage of the people attending sporting events and not at least expressing concern for employees or fans.@veedub77 @trailblazers Not that money and greed aren't motivators -- they definitely are, that's a partial explanation -- but it's also difficult to be nimble when you're an entity as large and with as many moving pieces as the NBA. The bubble worked because it was the exception, not the rule.@trailblazers @hornets @ROOTSPORTS_NW @RipCityRadio620 For my mental well-being, pls win@veedub77 @trailblazers I think this is less a problem of the leagues not caring and more evidence of the massive logistical challenges associated with balancing the physical health of players, fans and other personnel with the economic health of the individual teams and the league as a whole.@trailblazers @hornets @ROOTSPORTS_NW @RipCityRadio620 Big dubs tonight I know itConsensus Line Move:

The Trail Blazers now say Dennis Smith Jr will NOT play in tonight's game, and Jusuf Nurkic (finger) has been downgraded to questionable“ The team's next road game is Dec. 23 in Portland Trail Blazers, followed by a Christmas Day matchup at the Los Angeles Lakers and a Dec. 27 contest at the LA Clippers. 
That stretch is followed by three more home games. “

• Not to mention just a fairly high total.@sleepesoteric @trailblazers @rosecityboii @Alexancooper @britt_chacon @hhsocialwork Reply to this tweet with your email@Jonathan_Maus @trailblazers I would not go.

2 words DAME TIME. There is not a single team that needs a win more then the Portland Trail Blazers. They are 13-0 last 13 vs hornets at home . Hornets are 3-6 last 9 . It's Portland's night. Dame time.@theta444 @trailblazers thank you! really appreciate this.@Jonathan_Maus @trailblazers Anywayyyyys you're probably ok to go but I would double mask and not take off mask to eat or drink. The damn thing shouldn't be happening, she will only shut events down once cases have already skyrocketed, dumb.@Jonathan_Maus @trailblazers I was disappointed by how many people weren't wearing masks when I attended in early November. Everyone had masks but took them off as soon as they got to their seats, didn't cover their noses, etc. To Blazers credit, they did have employees to monitor.@Jonathan_Maus @trailblazers every day the risk is higher. I'd say go today but not in 2 weeks?@Jonathan_Maus @trailblazers Fwiw the state compared us to DK today in terms of population, immunity, etc. They didn't point out DK is shutting down big events 🙃@Jonathan_Maus @trailblazers We're going to the nutcracker tomorrow but it's obviously masked, vaxed, were getting tests right beforehand, and sedate crowd/no eating drinking...@Jonathan_Maus @trailblazers It's take a numbers game now. The gov should have shut down larger gatherings today. But it's not politically expedient so they're just pushing more boosters. Statistically, the fact the gathering is happening is the problem.@Jonathan_Maus @trailblazers On the individual level you yourself are statistically fairly safe. 
Your chances of all being safe get a little slimmer when you count the other 4 in your household if you get it.
Your chances of getting it are higher because of casual crowd eating and drinking and yelling@Jonathan_Maus @trailblazers Keep your mask on.NBA 🇺🇸

(h/t @Stathead) https://t.co/JRlkfKxVyw@trailblazers Thanks for all y’all do for the community! This looks like a good wholesome time 🤗@FORD81543625 @trailblazers @npowell2404 @trendonw @KBlevs02 Neil Olsheys burner account just declared itself@uop_yeayouknome @kevinlove @CollinSexton02 @trailblazers @BlazersUpriseYT As long as the Blazers are committed to continuing to build around Dame, I’m not on board with bringing Sexton in. I’ve seen enough of two small guards. Sexton next to Dame would be just like CJ next to Dame. And Sexton is even shorter than CJ. So I’m a no on that one.@trailblazers get me in touch with partnerships/sponsors plzkthxFrom now on I think I’ll sit here 😎 thanks for the experience @BLeitgeb @trailblazers https://t.co/3qgXzQdTiv@TheLordDecides @picklesbaseball @trailblazers @TimbersFC @IanKarmel @Hooters @SantaDecides @Zaxbys @BillyM2k @AXE @RichOToole @CRRBaseball God is a good to model children@chrisdigiusto @trailblazers Petty 🤦‍♂️This won’t happen but I could dream right? @celtics @sixers @Pacers @trailblazers https://t.co/UZjLdHh4FY@HarrisonRlyDum @picklesbaseball @trailblazers @TimbersFC @IanKarmel @Hooters @SantaDecides @Zaxbys @BillyM2k @AXE @RichOToole @CRRBaseball I’m fine with where I am!

Just wishing those numbers and percentages were turning to wins 🥺😢😭😩.@memgrizz @trailblazers Classless and immature. I’m pretty sure the @trailblazers account actually shouted you out and said good game after they bounced you in the bubble. I guess this is what it looks like to suck for decades and then finally start winning. Grow up 🙄Our exclusive interview with new @trailblazers President of Business Operations Dewayne Hankins uncovers a leader committed to bolstering the Moda Center fan experience (especially when arriving and leaving games) and to furthering the team's DEI goals.  https://t.co/FtvG34fGtXGreat article,  as usual, from you.
