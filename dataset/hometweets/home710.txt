[...and enter the #Knicks to swoop in for West. 🤗🤗] https://t.co/3hw569iu3F@AustinKY216 @ProCatsCoverage @JohnWall @HoustonRockets @abc13houston Russ could play for the Rockets, which is more than Wall can do. And the Rockets are 6 games out of the play in tourney as of tonite. A hot streak by Houston and collapse by a Dame less Blazers, maybe Rockets sneak in for the final spot. But I don’t think Lakers make the trade.@HeyyRB @HoustonRockets @reliantenergy @Barrytheturtle1 Haven’t looked at comments but assume it’s going to be 114 of 117 talking about “blood in blood out”
Maybe my number is three short!@HoustonRockets @reliantenergy It’s not even centered, this can’t be real. Remove the inside design and keep the logo/reliant, and center it. This looks awful@TebowCouch @ProCatsCoverage @JohnWall @HoustonRockets @abc13houston I don’t think AD &amp; Bron are irrelevant, but Lakers traded away glue guys that made their defense go. I don’t think they can rectify it now unless buyout guys can do it. I doubt that but who knows. Eric Gordon, Wall, AD, Bron and Reaves? I think that’s a better team than now@HoustonRockets @reliantenergy rockets setting 3k fans up for failure@NBALatam Houston RocketsNew #Rockets from Houston Chronicle — NBA revamps Rising Stars event for All-Star weekend https://t.co/vib33bb9Fh@HoustonRockets @reliantenergy Rockets selling gang attire?@AustinKY216 @ProCatsCoverage @JohnWall @HoustonRockets @abc13houston Mike on PTI “ this trade is irrelevant, the Lakers are irrelevant, there’s moving the deck chairs on the Titanic”

Wall’s a perfect example of why it should be used. IIRC the NBAPA opposes the amnesty concept for 2020. Tony and Mike on PTI talking about a Russ for Wall trade, but that’s a dream.@HoustonRockets @reliantenergy So are we trying to keep John Wall now??? 😂@HoustonRockets @reliantenergy yo whatWatching @JohnWall highlights… GET THIS MAN BACK TO PLAYIN! @nba @HoustonRockets@TermineRadio Houston was the first place he got to a WCF. He got farther with the Rockets than anywhere else before.This is so stupid, Rockets are willing to trade Wall for Russ and then buy out Russ, but can’t just buyout Wall and get on with their lives? Really?😂 Houston is so fucking dumb@gravetendencies @HoustonRockets 😂😂 bulls need to do thisThis is what bugs me so much. People want to act like the Harden/Paul pairing was a total failure in Houston. 

Chris Paul got hurt. That’s literally the reason the Rockets didn’t get to the Finals in 2018. It worked, even with the ugly breakup. https://t.co/CuaTH6Tm7u🚨FREE HOUSTON ROCKETS TICKETS 🚨

While that amount has reduced from $91M to “just” $68M, that’s still too much for most teams to fit into their cap. The most likely result is Rockets buying him out in Feb2023, when they will owe him $12M and can stretch it.@HoustonRockets @reliantenergy Finally Wall is getting some love@marioelie1 @HoustonRockets Mario Elie's ex teams rivalry! #Spurs #Rockets you bleed RocketsRed, right Mario 😅 https://t.co/eVSXjXhROw@HoustonRockets @reliantenergy wish i kould pullup@ThiagoSilveiraB @HoustonRockets Funny 🤣🤣@HoustonRockets @reliantenergy wowwww!!! i love my team !January 25th: Full card is posted

https://t.co/xnqyAdpoTd@LegionHoops @PompeyOnSixers BIG W FOR HOUSTON ROCKETSAccording to @KellyIkoNBA, #Rockets star C-PF Christian Wood has been subject to interest around the league, with the #Heat being one of the more persistent teams in engaging with Houston on him. But, barring an offer that blows them away, he shouldn't be traded. https://t.co/kxa7lQ22YaCongratulations to Warren who moved up 23 spots to take #17 on the Houston Rockets team leaderboard.

https://t.co/xnqyAdpoTdAccording to @KellyIkoNBA, the #Rockets have received a number of offers for SG Eric Gordon but Houston has rejected all and it's more likely that they keep him past the trade deadline barring an offer that simply can't be ignored. They're in no rush to move him. https://t.co/z4DPbSURjFNew #Rockets from Houston Chronicle — Upon return home, Rockets look to build on road success https://t.co/1PhRZyZIBCNew #Rockets from Houston Chronicle — Rockets' Alperen Sengun seeks return to pre-injury form https://t.co/4CeBqj5acHNew #Rockets from Houston Chronicle — For Gregg Popovich, forgetting was first step to rebuilding Spurs https://t.co/lJhGvb7pgxThe Houston Rockets Zhou Qi had his gucci flip flops on during the first half.Spurs at Rockets: Lineups, injury reports, broadcast and stream info for Tuesday #Houston #Rockets #NBA https://t.co/Twz95bxMsfRuss really still wants no part of Houston lol.
