This is exactly how my aviation career started in the late 90s. I was an 18 year old kid with a freshly minted Airframe technician’s certificate (the Power Plant part was still a work in progress at the time).

You have to take into account that Butler took a leap in Miami. Which you could also argue is bc Jimmy/Ben/Joel is an awful fit@GregSylvander @MiamiHEAT @WaterCleanupFL Over or under 21 shots for Bam tonight? Lol.  Probably Blake on him 😅@GregSylvander @MiamiHEAT Fixed that for you. https://t.co/JpZiMnDEcVAdditionally, 267 of those 475 overall sellouts have been at over capacity, where fans have purchased Standing Room Only tickets per @MiamiHEAT game notes.Miami has currently sold out 475-straight overall games, which includes both the regular season &amp; playoffs, the 6th longest sellout streak in NBA history per @MiamiHEAT game notes.
