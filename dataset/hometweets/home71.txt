[via r/nba Oct 29, 2013 #NBA]2nd best play of the day: Miami Heat -5 vs the Hornets

-Hornets have looked great, but they haven’t played a good defense like the Heat.
-Bridges will have a true defender on him in Tucker.
-Heat have a lot more firepower to run away w this game.

Game 1: Charlotte Hornets(+5, +180) head to Miami to take on the Heat (-5, -220) with the over/under of 222.5NBA champion prediction- Way too early, but here it is, Lakers won’t win it, too old, season too long. Kyrie Irving will not win a ring, if the Nets don’t move him, neither will they. I think Miami wins it all. Not a Heat fan, but they’re tough, built for the grind.HEY HEAT FANS!

At the end Bucks will lift a trophy again and you will end up crying like a typical Miami bitch.Miami Heat NBA Champions 2022.@ProundV @TmarkUchiha @MiamiHEAT "Its 2021-22. A whole new season"

Also Bucks are current champions and Miami are current first round exits. You can always comfort yourself with memories or that unsignificant regular season win against depleted  Bucks squad. Now go cry some more.@NBATV @DwyaneWade @MiamiHEAT The third best shooting guard in the history 😍@PBAinsider @JalenGreen How about Meta Worldpiece's son? i heard he has a filipino blood? and he just signed for the Miami Heat's G-League team. wait actually I wasn't sure if that's him. lol.Playing with a small and sufficient number of players, makes Miami Heat not give up and can win matches very well. #miamiheat #brooklynnets #basketball #nba #nba2021 #yolanda https://t.co/0pbVxBs65Qthe recession is real.

Going on Erik Sporlstra's reputation as a coaching savant, they should also have a top 10 Offense.

If they don't, that's a massive let down.

I will die on this hill.@tityana_ All I can think about is the heat and I’m scared to hangout over there lol. I have community service to do with my club that morning anyways in Miami from 9am-12pm 😩Betway expands NBA commercial portfolio with Miami Heat deal

Unless Strus starts getting more looks and he makes them but besides Herro, we really don't got another consistent scorer off the bench.@PMG2point0 @Canucks The Miami Heat did it years ago I think every sports team in existence should too. From Real Madrid to the local Bear Creek Park kabaddi team@GregSylvander @MiamiHEAT Where the knicks and bulls at on this list .. im watching the knicks and bulls game and they just said the knicks have the highest bench scoring ?? Bulls are 2nd .??@GregSylvander @MiamiHEAT Ok Greg the hope trafficking is being rooted in facts now, you’re becoming too dangerousThe @MiamiHEAT bench is averaging 46.3 points this season,highest in the NBA.

Miami’s reserves have 185 points, 2nd by only 2 points to tomorrow’s opponent, CHA (187), but Charlotte has played in 1 additional game.
Below: highest scoring benches in the NBA per HEAT game notes https://t.co/6Qgl7ZaqOq@HypeIsReal @FirstTake @McNuttMonica @chicagobulls @MiamiHEAT Yeah we are deff gonna need to add another piece but that shouldn’t be too hard. I don’t see Herro as a #1 option though.@PYeezy_6 @MiamiHEAT Didn’t they lose the Mickey Mouse ring in the Bubble?The @MiamiHEAT are our only hope. Incompetence runs deep through Miami sports.@NBATV @DwyaneWade @MiamiHEAT Okay, I see, Donovan Mitchell plays like him.Miami is allowing just 95 PPG, lowest avg in the NBA. They are limiting teams to just 39.2% shooting, also best in the league. No other team is even below 40%. 

Additionally, HEAT average margin of victory is +15.3, highest in the NBA per HEAT game notes @5OTF_ @5ReasonsSports#MiamiProud: For South Florida’s Wheelchair Basketball Team, ‘Miami Heat Wheels,’ It’s All About Therapy &amp;amp; Brotherhood
