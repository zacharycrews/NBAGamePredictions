In a new multiyear deal, Adidas will become the Academy's merch and equipment provider.

(📸: @BrooklynNets) https://t.co/tw3APjaxpt@GamersGoonYT @BrooklynNets No, he would have to have an agreement to resign for sure. Which you think he would do since he lost 200M as of now@eddieb2 @BrooklynNets You’re not trading both for a nearly 30 year old star that you’re not sure will resign. Myles is someone that’s always on the market cause they got Sabonis, I truly don’t see them moving either tho, if they do it’s for another big like KAT/Siakam/potentially Ben if they do DS@brainiac3397 @burntcebolla @Myreon69655313 @NetsDaily @BrooklynNets @joetsai1999 No, the topic isn't human rights, the topic is NBA support for China despite its human rights abuses.

If there were a topic on human rights abuses in the Palestinian territories I would be on it defending that person from people saying "well what about China, you hypocrite?"The @BrooklynNets battle the @nyknicks tonight 😎

https://t.co/SGBY03oMmZ@zawday @clappedtylerr @jpup01_ @BrooklynNets 1. I think they’ll get better offers from other teams and 2. I don’t see them wanting 2/3 of those players given they have their franchise center, they’ll probably prefer draft capital@NetsHive @clappedtylerr @jpup01_ @BrooklynNets His trade value has dipped I think.
