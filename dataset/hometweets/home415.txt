Keep sleeping on them.@therealjw1998 @theScore @LAClippers @cavs Last 3 games Batum has been only played off and on and PG has missed them completely while Clippers are still ranked 2nd in strength of schedule meaning only Lakers have a tougher schedule ahead@PlanetTuck @cavs @dariusgarland22 @kevinlove @isaacokoro303 @rickyrubio9 @evanmobley My English is pretty bad üòÖ, sorry about that, but no, I'm not kidding. We have different opinions, nothing more@Cavs executive Okoro, Garland, Cedi, Lauri, Rubio (if he decides to stay, it'll be up to him) but don't even think about trading, out of mind out sight. They stay. Now. Sexton yes. Kevin maybe. Denzel Valentine sure, yes. Why not. Only them. That's it.üö® We LIVE with @ChaseDownPod! üö®

After another double-digit win, join @Cavsanada and @Carter_Shade as they discuss our place in the East, upgrading the roster and more!
