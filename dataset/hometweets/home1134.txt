You don’t want to be the 3rd seed. The @cavs and @Raptors are losing at least 3 more games. Look at their remaining schedule Book it! @NBAonTNT@sixers / @cavs (two playoff teams fighting for seeding) play on Sunday but we wont see it on national tv because @ABCNetwork and @espn is airing @lakers v @nuggetsThe @cavs and @ATLHawks are playing a game on Thursday that has playoff implications, but it won’t be nationally televised. Instead, @NBAonTNT will be treating us (again) to the 11th-seeded @lakers. #NBATwitter#NBATwitter @WashWizards @celtics @MiamiHEAT @Bucks @SacramentoKings @warriors @cavs @BrooklynNets @Lakers @overtime @hornets @Zionwilliamson @RjBarrett6 Help this dude out please!!@omieg89 @BallySportsCLE @dariusgarland22 @cavs If the Cavs secure him, Mobley, and Allen for the next several years, they're in very good shape.  All their other rotation guys are easy to keep while also being tradeable if necessary.  The only one that could become too expensive to keep is Sexton.The @cavs are getting a new patch for their uniforms. #Cleveland #sportsbusiness https://t.co/ahjcfzbm6D@KenKrizner @WKYCSports @CleGuardians @Browns It’s really pathetic. I haven’t watched @WEWS in years. And @fox8news sports isn’t the same anymore either since JT retired. They’ve fallen into the same trap as the others, Browns first, @cavs and @CleGuardians second or third.@cavs @CLE_Cliffs @dariusgarland22 This commercial is 🔥 I’m a blue collar worker, so this hits home with me. Well done!@mollyhannahm @HOMAGE I’m going for @JoelEmbiid but I want that @HOMAGE  #NBAJAM  @cavs @evanmobley @dariusgarland22 #LetEmKnowNBA Basketball Game Betting Picks Simulator: 3/30/2022 7:00 PM ET - Dallas Mavericks vs. Cleveland Cavaliers - YOU CAN RUN THE GAME SIMULATION FOR FREE HERE: https://t.co/vAJS5njXTV #nba #sportsbetting #freepicks #cappertek$15.99- Plus An Extra 15% Off- You do the math-
