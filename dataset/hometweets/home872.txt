Most hyped prospect since Lebron, all star in his second year 28ppg and you want him traded? He’s gonna come back fine and work towards his peak, same thing happened to Joel Embiid and look at him.@Bigbird1182 I’m just saying Dallas so far won the season series against Memphis. Grizzlies don’t matchup well with him like the Clippers did. Not putting much stock in a team that won one playoff game against the Jazz.The Memphis Grizzlies are for real. Playing without their superstar against a team that’s hot lately and not letting up at all.@memgrizz @therealZiaire Ziaire's middy is hysterically good considering where the rest of his jumper is atshow and go from the kid with the dope fro 🎱

@therealZiaire // #GrzNxtGen https://t.co/IkKiaEeEKYSince the Lakers are shit this year, I’m just wishing the Miami Heat make the Finals, as well as the Memphis Grizzlies, and they go to 7 games and Miami wins the 2022 Championship.
