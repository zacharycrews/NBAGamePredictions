Expect the Bucks to start off blazing hot finally coming back home to the Milwaukee crowd. I think this is Giannis' real breakout game in this series, and for the role players to play better in their home environment.@OmarMKE1 @Bucks @celtics @CarnevorMKE @3rdStMarketHall 106-104 Bucks@Bucks Goat things@wisky_red @Bucks Correction. 3-1 Bucks after their two home games. Yes, they are winning this and the game after. Then the away game at Celtics will be Bucks in 5.Milwaukee Bucks ML -138 (1u)

Bucks are back at home in the Fiserv Forum. After getting embarrassed by the Celtics last game, I expect Giannis to show out at home. The crowd was a huge part in last year’s playoff run, expect them to be big tonight too.@Sc0rnman @Bucks @MotorolaUS @George_Hill3 SameThe Milwaukee Bucks play the Boston Celtics in Game 3 of the Best of 7 series in an hour!  Series tied 1-1!  Need to win this game today!  Go Bucks!  #FearTheDeer@Bucks @MotorolaUS @Giannis_An34 please win@Bucks Great player but also ranks in top 3 in league in non-calls when he bulls someone backwards. Becomes circular - "well, he's an mvp partly because he gets away with that" and refs hold back because he's a potential mvp. Not the best of the NBA when that happens.Check out Milwaukee Bucks Jrue Holiday #21 Nike Green Official NBA Swingman Icon Jersey #Nike https://t.co/3ckRq9gbWv via @eBay #NBAPlayoffs #NBA2K22 #NBA #NBAPlayoffs2022 #NBAonABC #NBATwitter @NBAMemes @NBAonTNT @NBA @NBAHistory @nbastats @Bucks @BucksPR @Jrue_Holiday11 #bucks@Bucks Watch a REAL MVP GO TO WORK TODAY !!!Perfect day to watch the @Bucks game at the @DeerDistrict. https://t.co/FuF1FwC1os@Bucks Going to be a big game for G today.

Let’s keep the 1Q streak going 👊🏽

Game 3. Home Team is usually the motivational side out the gate but especially in a tied series imo.

Bucks scored 28, 34, 34 in 3 playoff home games. 25+ in 6/7 games.

@celtics @Bucks@BucksDunkin @Bucks Love to see it! Here’s hoping for a big win@Wisco___Nation @Bucks Which is odd because they should have Ticketmaster data from last year - only round that I think sold for more than 2x season tickets price was finals and now there’s “fatigue”@celtics @Bucks @985TheSportsHub Let's go Celtics 🍀🍀🍀🍀🍀 #BleedGreenI head to enemy territory today @Bucks@dchipman10 @Bucks Yeah it seems like season ticket holders get offered a fair price. 100% agree though, there’s a fine line for pricing strategy on tickets that don’t get claimed by season tickets holders and the Bucks definitely overshot it@celtics @Bucks @985TheSportsHub On a completely different tangent, what are your thoughts on this?. The Lakers,have technically only won 15 titles under that name,from 1952 to 1954,they were known as the Minnesota Lakers,the other wins were in these years,but under Minnesota.@Bucks This wait felt like an entire year wrapped up in a workweek, but I am R E A D Y now to vicariously hit some putback dunks via Giannis💪🏾 https://t.co/HFGdpzSPZn@DavePasch @malika_andrews @Bucks @celtics @ABCNetwork Waiting on Ja Nem 🏀 #theoffs https://t.co/GoUENpHgyv@Bucks Nooooooo not George hill please nooooooooMilwaukee people are so nice I was like I’m here to root on the Celtics and they were like go Bucks but we hope it’s a good game for you and have the best time in Milwaukee and enjoy your trip!!
