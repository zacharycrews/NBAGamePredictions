For Example:

Sacramento Kings are -5.4 with Davion Mitchell ON COURT this season

But Mitchell's most common lineup (Him w/ the starters instead of Haliburton) is +16.4!

Per Cleaning the Glass@DLF_Karp @JonKayNFL It'd definitely be more fun to watch. But the whole super teams thing would piss a lot of people off. For instance I'm a Sacramento Kings fan. I know we have so little if any shot at all of going on a run ever unless we hit huge in the draft. No one wants to come to Sacramentohttps://t.co/eoFjfpVlTj @SacramentoKings @Groupon

Sacramento Kings +7 -110 2H (2 Units)🅿️ https://t.co/NTfU7QSndDClose, but no cigar. For the second time this season, the Kings gave the Jazz all they could handle. But just like last week's game in Sacramento, the veteran team from Utah found a way to close out the Kings. Here are six quick thoughts from the 119-113 loss.Maybe if the @SacramentoKings had played the King of the @MountainWest then they would have won tonight!

#TakeNote #AggiesAllTheWay @NeemyQuetaSZN @nemi1599 https://t.co/iCEUcBiIMMThe @utahjazz beat the @SacramentoKings 119-113  behind a combined 66 points for Donovan Mitchell and Mike Conley. 

Conley crossed the 30 point mark for the first time since January 1.

The Jazz move to 6-1 on the season. 

https://t.co/d4GV5FgQcR@SacramentoKings might as well just take a flier on Porzingis and @dallasmavs might as well take on Buddy Hield and Bagley. Really makes no sense for them to be on the Kings any longerThe whole Sacramento Kings organization terroristLove you guys.

@buddyhield and @hbarnes with 19 PTS each make it hard for the Utah Jazz to get the W. https://t.co/iJzrL13LRCIt’s funny reading kings fans comments about the refs tonight because that is how jazz fans felt a week ago when we played in Sacramento. #SACvsUTA@Vivek PLEASE SELL THE KINGS!!! Sacramento deserves better than this pitiful crap. You are the most horrible owner in sports history. PLEASE SELL!!!I promise you the @NBA hates the @SacramentoKings. If you don’t think so, you’ve never watched a Kings game.@NBA how can you watch this @SacramentoKings game and think it is fair???@SacramentoKings @buddyhield @ankr  Knows how to pick a team!! 😎@SacramentoKings Tristan Thompson!@SacramentoKings @buddyhield 3-14 field goalssssss

Neither willing to give inch early on - Their toughness will be on full display.
