@allin4nft @camreddish @nyknicks @nbatopshot @sonaya_r @HustlinShowroom @TheArchiveClub @TStopsy_kretts There isn’t a team I can think of that he would be able to fulfill the role I am talking about since it would be quite a gamble. I’ve seen glimpses when Trae was out. Almost every team could use a 3 &amp; D guy though so he will probably play that role for the rest of his career.Big game today @nyknicks 💪🏼 https://t.co/HWBU7Jvue5I have a sum of money dependent on the New York Knicks winning a basketball game against the Charlotte Hornets.

https://t.co/8x0nVix8SVToday’s game in New York against the Knicks is a homecoming for Charlotte’s James Bouknight. 

Bouknight was born in the Brooklyn neighborhood of Crown Heights.

More a bad evaluation by the Knicks then there ability to make it work. Not the defender or the athlete at this stage to make it work within a Thibs system@allin4nft @camreddish @nyknicks @nbatopshot I'm here for the trade...

@Troach01 @wearecoastl @wearecoterie @nfteddyverse@john_pec7 @nyknicks which would be terrible since the only reason Cam wanted out of Atlanta was to be able to play more , praying he gets his opportunity@john_pec7 @nyknicks nobody calling him a bad coach , i think everyone just fears he gonna do Cam like Obi or worse@allin4nft @camreddish @nyknicks @nbatopshot Strange deal for the Hawks. I would have thought packaging Cam in a package for a bigger piece would have been the play here but sometimes when it comes to distribution of shots addition is subtraction. I love the reunion with RJ and the opportunity for a larger role for Cam.@NBATV @TheKnicksWall @hornets @nyknicks Bullshit I gotta work@szantz Good news: New York gets a Zion!

The Hawks just got robbed. Reddish is only 22, and an awesome 3 and d guy. He will only get better in time. With him and RJ the Knicks are one step closer to get Zion.

I believe it will be the changing point for Reddish’s career but I do question the legitimacy of how him and RJ could work with eachother with past problems.

Rooting for a guy is an emotional thing. It’s not something you can turn off. It’s not a decision.
