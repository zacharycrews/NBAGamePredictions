#Cavs for #Life https://t.co/D3gIZNHcEn@KingJames Just go ahead and ask for a trade to the @cavs LA really doesn‚Äôt care.@NDiem1988 @goodysav @fgcu @cavs We don‚Äôt have any at the moment, but you can customize one in our shop at https://t.co/RwLQGBNOYD.@OsuRecruiting17 @cavs @firstenergycorp @evanmobley Kind of my point. Mobley fits perfectly not asked to carry the team yet is a big part of why the Cavs are where they are. He‚Äôs not asked to be the lead guy though he has been at times. More than happy with Mobley and not Cade.The @cavs Jarrett Allen, Darius Garland and Evan Mobley all deserve to be @NBAAllStar But they play for the Cavs and even though the game is in Cleveland only one or two will be selected. Mobley will be chosen for the rookie/sophomore game. @NBAThe difference between the #Browns &amp; #Cavs season.

@Browns = Drama 

@Cavs = Just Having Fun!
