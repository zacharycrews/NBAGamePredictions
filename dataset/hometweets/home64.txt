Congratulations @kylekuzma 🔥🔥🔥 https://t.co/DhANPxSFIq@DylanHudson5 @celtics We acting like this is isn't a completely new team with new coaching. I also understand the wizards are like that as well but we have to balance egos and it's alot harder to balance the talent we have. We have more talent than Washington but offensive rebounds killed us#WashingtonWizards now 3-1. Good so far, favorite new Wizard Montrezl Harrell. Worried about Gafford injury and others but just wait until Brad gets it going… he’s an All Star and guarantee will bounce back. When we get Thomas Bryant and Rui back that’s a ton of talent.Think about it tho: the Washington Wizards are 3-1 and they’ve only had one home game so farGood game @DonnieWahlberg! Your Celtics fought hard, and played hard.  Love, a Washington Wizards fan ❤️💙STOP SLEEPING ON THE WASHINGTON WIZARDS https://t.co/Uof9DAqwPP📈 Only 7% of analysts called the @WashWizards victory

The Hornets got 50 from there on Monday. In both games, the Celtics struggled to stop drives from the perimeter from getting deep into the paint, which usually results in points and FT’s (28 for Charlotte, 29 for Washington).@asian_bogan @tanfongkee @realsteelmuslim LOL, Enes Kanter. He got another Did Not Play tonight and the Celtics lost to the Washington Wizards 116-107 😆🏀Montrezl Harrell - Washington Wizards

Washington improves to 3-1, and looks like it's going to be a real factor in a crowded East playoff picture.

Not a Wizards guy, but I love seeing a small franchise do better and I also fucking hate the Celtics.It’s hard to believe Dinwiddie was a 2nd round pick. #WashingtonWizardsWashington Wizards @ Boston Celtics (7:30 PM ET)
Selection: Boston Celtics -4.5lakers game is over but can the washington wizards please close this outThe biggest thing Coach Unseld will have to work with Bradley Beal on. Playing winning basketball. We all know Beal is talented but Beal commits a lot of turnovers and pouts too much for me. Play winning basketball!
