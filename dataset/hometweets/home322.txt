Miami Heat -3

No Bam or Butler, but classic "NBA injured player theory" at work here. Miami is the far deeper team, look for a big game out of Herro &amp; Robinson and for them to win with defense. Cavs only avg 103 ppg

#HeatCULTURE 

https://t.co/KvLyHzX0EN@FP_NBA I went with Giannis over Jokic because of pace. Hornets probably more prone to high scoring games then the Magic. 
Might have overkilled the heat players but there's no way Miami stands a chance without Tyler and Kyle scoring from the perimeter ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èWelp, the Cavs are gonna win for the first time in Miami in a long time.

Miami comes off a blowout loss to Denver. Butler is questionable to miss his 2nd straight game. Cleveland enters with a 2-game W streak@BradDaugherty43 @cavs @MiamiHEAT Go Cavs-so much fun to watch this season!i dont know shit about basketball but to beat the heat and have the serbian anthem playin in the club in miami?? i love nikola jokic üòÇüòÇüòÇThe Cavaliers last win in Miami was on January 25, 2010, they've lost 20 consecutive road games there.

There are two remaining active players who played in that game, LeBron and Haslem (who is still on the Heat) and one who didn't play, Danny Green.

https://t.co/flS7Mjeu5UGood morning Cleveland sports fans it's that time again, Tonight our Cleveland Cavaliers face off against the Miami heat in what's sure to be a tough match up so its time to #LetEmKnow who ya got!Kyle Lowry has been a perfect fit so far with the @MiamiHEAT.

"His brain speed and IQ for the game is at such a high level that it really has a multiplying effect on everybody else on the roster," coach Erik Spoelstra told USA TODAY Sports. https://t.co/c7sDqsZTpVThe Cavs have lost 20 straight in Miami. 

I‚Äôm very interested to see how tonight plays out. This is a good Heat team! If you want to establish yourself as a good team, you gotta win games like this. 

Time to flip the switch if we win tonight @KenCarman @SportsBoyTony #LetEmKnow@premium_sd @nbatopshot They did incredible with the camera on this one. Not enough people appreciate those Miami Heat days!#miami heat lead the league in corner threes üßê someone tell @evanmobley @MarkkanenLauri and @kevinlove to stop helping and to stay with their man
