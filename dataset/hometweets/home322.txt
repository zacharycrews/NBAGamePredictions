Miami Heat -3

No Bam or Butler, but classic "NBA injured player theory" at work here. Miami is the far deeper team, look for a big game out of Herro &amp; Robinson and for them to win with defense. Cavs only avg 103 ppg

#HeatCULTURE 

https://t.co/KvLyHzX0EN@FP_NBA I went with Giannis over Jokic because of pace. Hornets probably more prone to high scoring games then the Magic. 
Might have overkilled the heat players but there's no way Miami stands a chance without Tyler and Kyle scoring from the perimeter 🤷‍♂️Welp, the Cavs are gonna win for the first time in Miami in a long time. Glad we survived that road trip for every HEAT player to get hurt at home.@ChompChompxx @MiamiHEAT W troll@MiamiHEAT I disagree too, it should be a first round pick...#MIAvsCLE

The Bucks didn't get Bogdanovic and they got the same exact punishment. Miami and Chicago both got what they wanted and paid the same price. If you ask me, the Heat and Bulls got off way too easy.@MiamiHEAT We moooooove@MiamiHEAT The nba are full of clowns apparently Miami being good is suspicious@dirtysprit305 @JimmysBurner5 @MiamiHEAT I probably hate this team as much as you do at this point lmao@MiamiHEAT How are we losing?Chicago Bulls, Miami Heat forced to forfeit draft picks from Lonzo Ball, Kyle Lowry tampering ruling https://t.co/vzLWNeWqof #NBA #ChicagoBulls #MiamiHeat@JrueBurnerAcct @MiamiHEAT Another day, another shit tweet from JrueBurner@MiamiHEAT We really gotta pop off now bc of this… hopefully 😅Who was hurt by the tampering? Maybe the other teams that wanted Kyle and never got to make a genuine pitch? But Kyle clearly wanted Miami. Raptors seemed OK with it. The Heat lose a 2nd rounder. Oh well.

There are two remaining active players who played in that game, LeBron and Haslem (who is still on the Heat) and one who didn't play, Danny Green.

https://t.co/flS7Mjeu5UGood morning Cleveland sports fans it's that time again, Tonight our Cleveland Cavaliers face off against the Miami heat in what's sure to be a tough match up so its time to #LetEmKnow who ya got!Kyle Lowry has been a perfect fit so far with the @MiamiHEAT.

"His brain speed and IQ for the game is at such a high level that it really has a multiplying effect on everybody else on the roster," coach Erik Spoelstra told USA TODAY Sports. https://t.co/c7sDqsZTpVThe Cavs have lost 20 straight in Miami. 

I’m very interested to see how tonight plays out. This is a good Heat team! If you want to establish yourself as a good team, you gotta win games like this. 

Time to flip the switch if we win tonight @KenCarman @SportsBoyTony #LetEmKnow@premium_sd @nbatopshot They did incredible with the camera on this one.

How many rounds?@metal_splinter @JMurrayWrld @59Jhe @dannyirish91 @PackersSuck69__ @heatsource3 @WadexFlash @MiamiHEAT And you say "charge at a person's back" like he waited for him to turn away or like that "person" didn't just spear him in the ribs in a blowout.@metal_splinter @JMurrayWrld @59Jhe @dannyirish91 @PackersSuck69__ @heatsource3 @WadexFlash @MiamiHEAT So queef wasn't wrong for throwing a cheap shot to jokers ribs and immediately turning around to walk away (bitch move)..? In a 17 point game nonetheless? That's the MVP, and a classic case of, fuck around, find out, if I ever saw one.Jokics brothers told Morris twins to pull up. 
Came courtside to watch Nuggets trash Heat. 
THEN they went to the club in Miami and burnt that bitch down 😭🤣🤣
