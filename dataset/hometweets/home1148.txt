I remember tweeting last April that the Chicago Bulls were two years away from being two years away. So if they win the 2025 NBA title I would be right onCheck out GRN034 1995-96 Finest #229 Michael Jordan #ChicagoBulls https://t.co/TSgBo6qDXv via @eBayYeah... I'm not sure Zach's a lock to stay with the @chicagobulls. Coach Donovan wants ball movement. One-on-one sh*t doesn't fly with Coach Donovan. I've witnessed some of the things Zach's been doing lately.
I understand he's probably just re-asserting himself but gotta pass https://t.co/w9URqKjYvs@chicagobulls_12 @Allen_Payne15 @NBA Nothin but snow and flatlands.  It was January, so we can't even pretend there was corn or soybeans.Some matchup rankings headed into Clippers at Chicago for Thursday night.

Should be a fun duel between Paul George and DeMar DeRozan. But big X-Factor tonight will be the role of Alex Caruso, who helped harass George into 7/25 FGs in LA while leading Bulls in rebounds/assists. https://t.co/RmJ269J9IuCongratulations to JackedEwing and zek (@NFTZek) who moved up to take #17 and #24 on the Chicago Bulls team leaderboard.

https://t.co/WEF4PhF0Rq@LALeBron23 @KCJHoop @Stacey21King @chicagobulls @BullsSource @NBCSBulls Give Zach the 34 million he believes he deserves and trade for AD who wants out of LA and to come home and playLittle man waiting for daddy to get home to take him to the bulls game. To say I’m extremely excited to take my son to his first bulls gametoo tonight is an understatement.. @chicagobulls https://t.co/xuFC8cedCj@atmos_usa 11.5M #atmosweb

Gotta be the Nike Kobe 4 USC PE. I went to the school so large bias here but seeing Demar hoop in these and mirror Kobe’s game was special. Being from Chicago and him with the Bulls now and being a huge Kobe collector, it’s an easy choice.

9 seasons. 6 championships. The 1989-1998 Chicago Bulls featuring Michael Jordan.

Bet slip link: https://t.co/FZgQjANapB https://t.co/8YjMuxQbvwBut I’m probably a hypocrite by saying this since I am following the Chicago Bulls and I know that they’re not going to win a playoff series. I’ve set a goal for them to go 48–34. That’s a consolation prize also technically.I wanna go to a Pistons and a Bulls game.

#Basketball https://t.co/WNj6L9TGL9The only probable must win might be at Chicago. If the Bulls get hot, you don’t want them stealing home court.

Suddenly reborn Clips play Bulls today in Chicago &amp; are 3.5 dogs.
Will PG13-have a negative rebound from Monster “debut?”
Will TLu rest him more in 2nd game back?
Bulls &amp; Raptors in flat-out tie w/ 6 games left for 5th place. Game prolly depends on their desire 2 win.Whatever u do @chicagobulls plz 🙏 don’t trade for gobert this summer we don’t need a overpaid French deandre jordon on the squad @arturasfanclubChicago Bulls: Recent road struggles loom large for playoffs https://t.co/tKzoKTh6hPWho wins??

1. Toronto Raptors

3. Chicago Bulls (They are my #2 when ZO playing)@JLew1050 Magic number for 6th is now at 5 for the Raps over Cavs.
The Bulls start a 5 game homestand that sees the Georged up Clips, Heat, Bucks , Celts and a desperate Charlotte in Chicago.

Listen on the ESPN Chicago App: https://t.co/wW3aSvpdc4 https://t.co/0cl3PCMpUpI really think the @chicagobulls might end up with Anthony Davis this summerSo the Raptors are back and tied with Chicago for 5th... Bulls have the tie-breaker in that situation and face the Clippers, who just got Paul George back, tomorrow night. 

Cavs now a full 2 games back of the Raptors for 6th after their loss to the Mavs tonight.@RipLegendSeanT The way i wanted my Chicago Bulls to draft him , I was so pissed we took Elton Brand instead . They made it right though when we took D.RoseWith tonight’s victory, the Toronto Raptors (44-32) move into a tie for fifth in the East with the Chicago Bulls (44-32)…

The #Bulls own the tiebreaker, winning the season series 3-1 against the #Raptors.

#6 TOR vs #3 MIL https://t.co/PBSL95vTKl“We had to pick up our energy tonight.

This will do.Raptors on the way to their 10th win in 12 games. Cavs lose for the 13th time in 20 games. Toronto will match Chicago (who won last night) at 44-32, though the Bulls still sit in 5th via the tiebreaker, and take a 2-game lead on Cleveland for 6th. 6 games left.My Brother I love the Chicago Bulls and victory for me, the Chicago Bulls. https://t.co/CQKEHVxJFO@JayRomanii @_cmartinez13 @chicagobulls Come again?KC johnson who reports about the chicago bulls . saying the bulls should go after Gobert, Ayton , AD. to be honest with you i wouldn't mind AD going to bulls because his goal by in 2020. he wants to go back home to chicago.
