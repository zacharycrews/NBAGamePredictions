I got a feeling @CadeCunningham_ to Bagley going to be electric.Detroit’s plan all along was to retain Jerami Grant. #Pistons listened to the substantial interest in Grant, but stuck to their guns with the hope that he can continue developing alongside Cade Cunningham, Isaiah Stewart and Saddiq Bey as part of a winning future core.As a lifelong @DetroitPistons fan I’m really excited about seeing Marvin Bagley in a new situation while still staying flexible@moving forward. Anyone who thinks Troy Weaver took a step back today is short-sighted. Nothing wrong with todays move. #JustSayin@DetroitPistons get Armoni please….
#PistonsJerami Grant Trade Rumors: 'No Deals Made Sense' for Pistons at 2022 Deadline #Detroit #Pistons #NBA https://t.co/LfQy1nJYil#RT @ShamsCharania: Jerami Grant remains with the Detroit Pistons as NBA trade deadline ends. Grant and the Pistons have comfortability with each other moving forward.the portion of the pistons fanbase who want Grant gone like he isnt a great player who WANTS TO BE IN DETROITtrade deadline darkhorse? Pistons IMO. They just paired up Cade, their #1 pick, with Bagley former #2 pick and will inevitably get more for Grant in the off-season. Young team that has a bright future, for sure.

Grade: https://t.co/UG3ImVKGfP@detroit_wyso Because the only one who knows the deals are the pistons front office.  What were they offered?  Ppl were saying we should have got more for Drummond but he’s working on two years of minimum contracts.  WE DO NOT KNOW. Smh.Jerami Grant is still a Detroit Piston 🤟🏼@FanDuel Probably Chauncey Billups. Debatable cause most of that team was acquired via trades but imo Chauncey was the leader. @DetroitPistons #NBATradeDeadlinePistons elect to keep Jerami Grant #Detroit #Pistons #NBA https://t.co/ZHzVg1EfQeSurprised Grant wasn’t traded but I’m okay with that. Also a fan of getting Bagley. Will be a good steal if plays at some potential @DetroitPistons@AnotherSFwriter @TeamBagley @DetroitPistons The most successful point of his basketball career is making it to the NBA. I’m not explaining this over and over. You know exactly what I mean.I am left disappointed after the trade deadline. The one thing that needed to happen for the @DetroitPistons, didn't happen. #NBATradeDeadline #pistons #nbatrade #NBA@AnotherSFwriter @TeamBagley @DetroitPistons You’re confusing pinnacle and prime. 

He’s on the ultimate stage of basketball, in the NBA. The pinnacle of basketball. This is because of the WORK he put in.

You might want to take a look in the mirror. He’s at the pinnacle of his career, where you at?Jerami Grant is still with the Detroit Pistons after the NBA trade deadline. My thoughts.

Now that the NBA trade deadline is over, here's intel &amp; tidbits on the trade(s) DET did and didn't make.

Inside Detroit's deadline:

https://t.co/T42dn61bUW@DetroitPistons why did y’all keep cory joseph 💀💀💀Memphis is an 11-point favorite against Detroit tonight. Teams that are a 10+ point favorite on the road this season are 14-2 overall and 9-6-1 against the spread.

Thanks for the work here in Sac!This tells me the Pistons are going to give Bagley some money this summer. 

Always liked his potential and offensive versatility. He’s come along as a defender this year, but Sac was never a good fit for him. 

Excited to see what he can do with a fresh start in Detroit. https://t.co/x8qRxKwd83I'm definitely going to miss Josh Jackson. That dude was pure Detroit. Certain Pistons role-players over the years just stick with me as guys I'll always have love for.
