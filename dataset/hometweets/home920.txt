Interim Kings coach Alvin Gentry makes surprise change to starting lineup; update on Richaun Holmes (and then another update on Holmes); Josh Giddey, Luguentz Dort among half-dozen players ruled out for Oklahoma City Thunder.

https://t.co/6JE92c0qFt@SeanRadech @TwinsAlmanac Sure, but the franchise and the state are two different entities. The Oklahoma City Thunder have retired the numbers for Lenny Wilkens and Gus Williams and Jack Sikma. It doesn't mean any of them would be in the Oklahoma Sports HOF. They never played an NBA game in the state.Updated Injury Report at Oklahoma City Thunder - 2/28:

Being a fan of the Oklahoma City Thunder I feel for Mr. Westbrook.  I felt "sorry" for him at the end of the game.  I know he could not care what I think, which is, to me, one of the great things about him.  He does not listen to the noise.
