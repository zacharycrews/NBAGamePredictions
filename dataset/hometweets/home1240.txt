Clint Capela's injury will make-or-break Atlanta's chances. The Heat need to manufacture floor spacing or else the Hawks can outscore them. A closer matchup than seeding indicates

Prediction: Heat in 7 https://t.co/tysVXi7VG7Miami scored their most points per-possession against the Hawks this season

Miami averages 1.14 points per possession but against the Atlanta Hawks that number grew to 1.22

Teams that play drop coverage on defense (Hawks and Bulls), the Miami Heat tend to feast on https://t.co/cfLEIgnHAv@Marlins @FinFanForLife @MiamiHEAT @j_chisholm3 @raf_tyler Good luck today, Happy EasterNot sure why everyone thinks Miami Heat will beat Atlanta Hawks easily.

The loss of Capella will hurt Atlanta. I prolly would of stayed away from this game if Capela was in but he is a big part of this team. John Collins is Q, I don’t think he might be 100% healthy.

2u Heat -2 games (-105)

Lack of size and rim protection for the Hawks against Bam. Heat have multiple good defenders and players who can switch on Trae in the pick n roll. I think Miami makes quick work in 5 but push potential if it goes 6.

Previa Miami Heat vs Atlanta Hawks  https://t.co/siiJp5oyD6Miami Heat -6.5

Heat should take care of hawks. Miami won both matchups with no Capela. No Bam in those either, but git him here. Heat top defensive team while ATL is near the bottom.

#CherryPicks🍒Miami Heat 2022 NBA Champions@willis_glen I have seen quite a few people in NBA media I respect picking Heat in 4 and saying maybe Trae can steal a game.  Maybe I'm just too far deep but I don't understand how people think this will be a cakewalk with Miami's lack of offense and Trae Young and the #2 offense in the NBA.ASK IRA: Are Heat, NBA returning to period of COVID uncertainty at start of playoffs? #Miami #Heat #NBA https://t.co/zXkXk29ekcITS A MIAMI HEAT PLAYOFF GAMEDAY WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOGood morning and Happy Easter to those who celebrate.

That's why 'the king' gets heat. Miami had no business losing that series. They had far superior talent but were too busy trying to (cough, cough) clown Dirk.

They are quicker and mentally more tough. I don't know who would win that series but it's no sweep! Nets are both underrated and over rated.

W bracket@MrBenDohver @Lakitu886 @michaelh223 @MiamiHEAT @FTXArena 16 followers since 2016 there’s no reason imma listen to anything u say lol cause nobody else does obviouslyIon think Trae Young wanna be hated in Miami if anything he will earn respect but Heat not going out like that again@Will7253 @MiamiHEAT yea lmao@williams_enooo Haha! They are in the picture for sure! But the Suns… oh the Suns! And my Dubs are always going to be in the conversation, although injuries have been tough this year! And there’s the Celtics and Miami Heat! When you guys survive the East, let me know 😂😂Let’s Go Heat! 🔥🔥🔥 #WhiteHot @MiamiHEAT https://t.co/HRauHUgTAT@MiamiHEAT Oladipo is back too, but obviously not a Spo teacher's pet. He has the experience that Heat need in a play off series- something some of the teacher's pets can only wish for, but arrogance will be the reason if this team fails, not player capability.We are a Miami Heat loving press but our distributor is in Minneapolis so we will root for @Timberwolves in the West, but we will not tolerate any Jimmy Butler negativity. https://t.co/VGrYBLiRZS@JayTisdale5 @ShadyDane @ThePettiestLA Facts in hands of people who lack nuance in applying them are painful. But, this has been helpful in hammering that point. But, I understand your point. 42&gt;29 so if Nash had gone to Miami the Heat would’ve won 73 games bc that’s the exact application of the number Suns improved.@MiamiHEAT We wanted white hot jerseys this is not white hot@MiamiHEAT Oladipo not worthy enough to be considered "team member" ?@therealsjc_ Maybe I'm mistaken, but aren't the matchups based on seeding? For instance: If the Heat #1 seed beat the Hawks#8 seed, then Miami's would be matched up against the lowest seed in Brooklyn #7 seed..@MiamiHeat opens quest for 4th @NBA title Sunday against Trae Young, Hawks https://t.co/byvoial3EaIt’s criminal for the NBA to schedule a Miami Heat playoff game at 1 pm on a Sunday when everyone is gonna be hungoveri’m lebron in miami, i provide for the heat.@MiamiHEAT @DracoBuckets7 ESPN, NBA TV, and TNT rn https://t.co/P8qMVOf07x@MiamiHEAT they brought seven nation army back… yeah heat in 5 against anybody@MiamiHEAT Where is Dipo?Dave Hyde: Age-old question for Miami #Heat as playoffs open with good team, great chance  #NBA #Hawks https://t.co/BOBXJUww1X https://t.co/rG5zrFql6DDid everyone get their Miami Heat Bets at +1200 in?

Where you see that at? I'm saying Nash turn a 29gm win team to a 60 win team. He made the Suns a big deal he deserve that MVP. Shaq got consideration.

@MiamiHEAT vs. @Suns in a battle of the last two losing finals teams.

In his preview of the series, @william_lou looks at how Miami's ability to defend Trae Young will be the key matchup to watch. 

https://t.co/HXjNMy71cC@MiamiHEAT Where’s @VicOladipo@bucsnationx21 i have nothing against the Suns, just a huge Nuggets fan 😂 I became a Nuggets fan in sixth grade which was almost about 18 years ago, and we’ve come close a few times 

also want the heat to win and make it to the finals so I can maybe go to a Nuggets NBA finals game in Miami 😂@miamiheat or the @atlhawks https://t.co/Q5mYs4unt3@MiamiHEAT @dpoybam_ Duncan with a headband? 😅 where’s Dipo??“Nobody feared LeBron” niggas must ain’t ever see him in that black Miami Heat uniform@13d_riera Yeah, it’s south Florida. If it’s not a big time event it’s tough to pull a crowd for anything. Heat are #1 in the East and they haven’t sold a game out in months. It is what is, but Hard Rock should be full so long as Miami is playing well and winning.
