Yes or No?@nyknicks @monicamcnutt That's the wrong Monica McNutt account.@nypost The Knicks need to fire their fans.

They have a reputation as being great fans but they are actually terrible.

The pressure from the NY fans and Media is an obstacle that other teams don't have to overcome.

That's why Kyrie Irving is not playing in New York. NBA should move the Nets back to New Jersey. https://t.co/HW0832UY0Z@nyknicks @J30_RANDLE Trade him@nyknicks trade him https://t.co/nTZbivSPEDhe is lazy he plays on the New York  knicks@nyknicks @J30_RANDLE His game at Sacramento was his best this year. Looked great live!booty Kardashians like dark meat! The only thing he got in common with her husband is the bipolar thing, She’ll be at a @nyknicks game in a few months looking👀 for husband #3 or #4 or whatever 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣@nyknicks @J30_RANDLE Nobody cares ! We want RJ!Knicks fans can learn from this.  At some point put out your egos and understand greatness happening in your own city. @nyknicks https://t.co/VhoZ6lr8ID@rads619 Well who is not a @nyknicks fan?? Just wish they sell the team!RJ Barrett eyeing 20 points-per-game mark amid Knicks’ lost season #NewYork #Knicks #NBA https://t.co/wx5KjGzGRKDead or alive we still top five @nyknicks  😤😂 https://t.co/mDYD60rrc7The NYC Mayor knows what's up with what Team to be a fanatic of, and of course it should be The Big Brother New York Knicks. #NewYorkForever https://t.co/7PBi2RsdhV@Bad_Azz662 @Bknicks @nyknicks @J30_RANDLE Randle leads the team in Pts, Reb, and assist and is only one of 4 players in the NBA that avg 20 pts and 10 RB and dude blame Randle for the team losing.  What about the other 14 players and the coach?  Randle is out producing most of the NBA stars.  What more you want from him?Please @nyknicks make a trade with @Pacers and bring @C_Duarte5 to the big apple!@Bad_Azz662 @Bknicks @Leo54866627 @nyknicks @J30_RANDLE LMAO.. clown logic.  He says Randle stats are meaningless because the team is headed for the lotto and not going anywhere but RJ stats are great even though he plays for the same team.  LMAO. These fake Knicks fans are funny.@johnnyjohnjon83 @Bad_Azz662 @NBA_NewYork I don't come for your fandom because you disagree. I come for it b/c you care more about RJ than the team. You want to take a really good player off the team because you think your guy will shine more even though the KNICKS would lose their leading PTs, REB and assist man.@johnnyjohnjon83 @Bad_Azz662 @NBA_NewYork You know Fournier is a shooter right?  A better 3pt shooter than Barret. You worried about Barret not getting the ball but not the other 2 knicks on the court. So it about Randle not wanting RJ to get the ball but not the other 2 guys? LOL He okay with Fournier but not RJ? LOL@rads619 🤣😂🤣😂🤣! No one ☝️ is conspiring to help the @nyknicks ….not even their front office! 🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂😂😂@Marc_DLT There’s only one NewYork team I’ll be disappointed by year after year bro and that’s the Knicks hahah I can’t afford moreNew York’s mayor has to be a biased Knicks fan, because ain’t no way that you can have a mandate as bad as this one and keep it, especially when Kyrie is balling out on a nightly basis@yardman33 @johnnyjohnjon83 @NBA_NewYork This is a product of fans now root for specific players success not for team success anymore. As a Knick fan I cheer for the NY Knicks not for the NY Randles or NY RJs. The facts are that RJ and Randle takes pressure off each other get them a PG and let's go win some games.New York Knicks: Where Tom Thibodeau's thoughts are regarding his Knicks future https://t.co/j54vuTYDSs@yardman33 @Bad_Azz662 @NBA_NewYork The audacity and arrogance you have.. lol you’re a “real” Knicks fan and I’m an RJ fan.. FOH with that when RJ plays bad I call him out too.. you’re a Randle Stan that maybe watches the games but doesn’t pay attention to the nuances. RJ will be open and Ju will look him off@yardman33 @johnnyjohnjon83 @NBA_NewYork Bro this first team in my existence of being a Knick fan where we are sucking as a team and these so call "real" Knicks fans are protecting someone from that team because of why? Eddy Curry was hated and loathed by Knick fans but they didn't make excuses for Marbury or Crawford@johnnyjohnjon83 @Bad_Azz662 @NBA_NewYork You notice you crap on Randle and I don't crap on RJ?  I am a real Knicks fan while you are an RJ fan. You don't have to trash Randle to show your love for RJ.  Trust me, like every good NBA player, both RJ and Randle want good players around them to take pressure off and to win@Bknicks @Leo54866627 @nyknicks @J30_RANDLE 🤣🤣🤣 RJ is on this same team that you mad over that's a lottery team htf is this a good thing. Everyone on this team this year has struggled and made mistakes wtf cares how long you are in the league you will still make mistakes on the floor.Tom Thibodeau’s focus on Knicks’ day-to-day progress, not his future #NewYork #Knicks #NBA https://t.co/srtQgq2eAo@TracyMorgan @ohsnapjbsmoove @nyknicks @MSGNetworks Cuz you crazyTrail Blazers Game Notes: Portland Trail Blazers (26-41) vs. New York Knicks (28-40) – NBA News https://t.co/NSrQnGLc7u@tmilom99 @diazjorge1 @PettyAirJordan @nyknicks many are saying it's not a real Championship,  and I agree... it was all in one place, when the NBA stopped for a certain amount of time... it gave AD a chance to heal up and be able to play again... thats not how it should be, when teams stop games you lose..  momentumKnicks could lose Kenny Payne to Louisville | New York Knicks https://t.co/29IHZRkO2l via @YouTubeTrail Blazers Game Notes: Portland Trail Blazers (26-41) vs. New York Knicks (28-40) https://t.co/skIu91LBCH https://t.co/OOvFeVy7CtCongratulations to mbl267 (@mbl267_NFT) who moved up 5 spots to take #2 on the New York Knicks team leaderboard.

https://t.co/KTWpkR4EiB@StringBeanDean @nyknicks My dude that was a yr ago! what has he done other than destroy the team’s confidence by play weak ass burks and Fournier and not playing our rookies. what’s going to happen is all the young guns we have will sign with another team and become Knick killers@quietknicksfan @J30_RANDLE @RjBarrett6 @obitoppin1 @IQ_GodSon @nyknicks Sad… we’re not on “anybody’s” timeline. Are we ready to “win”? No. Are we “rebuilding” no, not necessarily when you have the likes of Randal, kemba, Fournier…..
So what are but a “middle of the pack team” in a very competitive division. No…no one is attracted to the @nyknicks https://t.co/mVXeTtERzh@Bad_Azz662 @Leo54866627 @nyknicks @J30_RANDLE Implied how ? Weird how u dismiss the fact that Randle is in his 8th year making rookie mistakes and just decided to show up in March ...lottery team going nowhere with a front runner player and a stubborn coach. Rj is the only good thing this franchise has.. go back in your hole@ClintNeck @J30_RANDLE @RjBarrett6 @obitoppin1 @IQ_GodSon @nyknicks I think it was Rolando Blackman. 

But you're right.@BCM_Ching Never ever has “playing young talent” been @nyknicks management style. See Patrick Ewing, you last marquee “young talent” you wouldn’t even know the plethora of talent discovered at the end of the bench due to injury. You’d here “they’re getting better in practice”@Leo54866627 @Bknicks @nyknicks @J30_RANDLE Nope but it's was definitely implied. I bet money that if RJ was posting these stats yall cats would be creaming your jeans.@quietknicksfan @J30_RANDLE @RjBarrett6 @obitoppin1 @IQ_GodSon Been watching this team ownership for a while. The last time the @nyknicks went out to “get that last piece” was Aquisition of the X-man remember? Tell me when was the last time the @nyknicks were in a position to “pull the trigger” on that last piece?#KNICKS#TAKIN#NO#SHORTS#AGAINST@PORTLAND#NEW#YORK#KNICKS#VS#PORTLAND#TRA... https://t.co/E8hVJhsY2e via @YouTube
