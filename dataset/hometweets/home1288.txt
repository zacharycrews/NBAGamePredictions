For @MavericksSI, I took a closer look at the Suns' picking apart the Mavericks' defense: https://t.co/p1GSOyJ3Z2Dallas Mavericks really need to up their game, anything other than that will be elimination from the playoff series.The Sun's are a different team when compares to the Jazz.@dallasmavs (@ReggieBullock35 )

In fact, the Mavs could use Pinson right about now.  Very cerebral lengthy defender and playmaker who scored relentlessly in the G League. An X factor that the Suns won’t plan for.

https://t.co/WfJLIwQ7MK@FTFonFS1 @Chris_Broussard So Dallas Mavericks competition is themselves..kAs a @dallasmavs I agree, and it’s tough to admit and submit to this. It’s true, I’m sick of coming up short constantly. Management has to be hard at work this off season. https://t.co/w18tHk0WdiPlace to be for #Sports this weekend are #KentuckyDerby and #Dallas #DFW #VictoryPark 
@dallasmavs @DallasStars@dallasmavs @ESPNNBA @theeagledallas Start Dinwiddie in place of Brunson and see if he can get in the paint early. Maybe that will light a fire under Brunson. DFS needs to step it up too, I don’t think he’s gotten one offensive board, or put back dunk.@dallasmavs @ESPNNBA @theeagledallas Protect home court and someone please help out Luka. He is on a island all by himself with no water or food naked and afraid.Mavericks’ moment of truth: After Chris Paul’s Suns picked up on Luka Doncic, what can Dallas do in Game 3? https://t.co/bDxe4kzsVY@SportsCenter Get the broom sticks for the @dallasmavs"The Mavericks will leave Dallas down 3-1.

Bet slip link: https://t.co/ORkKZUnSFU https://t.co/SJrDS4bHTIThe Phoenix Suns' defense has made things challenging for the Dallas Mavericks in ways they did not encounter in their first-round matchup against the Utah Jazz. 

For @MavericksSI, I wrote about some key differences the Suns' defense presents:
https://t.co/sdhtqpNcVE@dallasmavs @ESPNNBA @theeagledallas Let's Go Mavs! #MFFLPhoenix Suns vs. Dallas Mavericks Game 3 Picks and Predictions https://t.co/EuLRHqSBYS via @YouTube@dallasmavs @ESPNNBA @theeagledallas Mavs fans have so much negativity and are so toxic, that instead of embracing their team when they are down they do the opposite. I imagine one of their players looking at twitter and finding all this crap, I'd make up an injury.
Nothing like Real Madrid eh
 @luka7doncic? 
#MFFLBeen laying low the last few weeks waiting for a hammer and it has finally come 🔨 

🚨BET THE FARM ALL IN BEST BET🚨

This is a MUST win for the Mavs who are much better at home and are the best team in the NBA ATS off of a loss (24-9 ATS)

🔒 DALLAS MAVERICKS +1 🔒Are y’all #MFFL eating a burger today for the @dallasmavs W tonight?! #dALLasIN #NBAPlayoffs https://t.co/f3KL7fQgss@dallasmavs @ESPNNBA @theeagledallas maybe Mavs will win, but 4:1 or 4:0 makes no difference, they need an big man, an second all star..or all star caliber, Luka and 13 role players will never ever win anything@dallasmavs @ESPNNBA @theeagledallas Time to step the F up!@BarlundR @true2atlanta @ESPNNBA @dallasmavs Also your best player shouldn’t even be tied for worst plus minus so my point still stands on that. He’s a flat out liability on defense. Tatum in the other hand is locking up on defense AND leading forwards in PPG and APG this postseason. Levels to thisVIERNES 🤑#NBA🏀

I am not a representative of the Dallas Mavericks organization.@_mcflyboi_ @dallasmavs @Chime Wouldn't count on it. We can't fight over their offensive screens like Bridges doesn't. They find the match they need and have an advantage every possession. They also have Ayton who they can throw the ball to and get an easy bucket. 

We need a big mostly. Bad match up for us.@BarlundR @true2atlanta @ESPNNBA @dallasmavs The suns were seeking out Luka to make him play defense. They would get him switched on book or CP and then let them COOK Luka.

These teams suck.I’m torn as to what the @dallasmavs need to improve this roster. Who would I move and what position needs an upgrade the most?
Do we upgrade (mostly for defense/size) at 2 and let @jalenbrunson1 walk or do a sign-and-trade? Brunson will get even better than he already is.

You've also got to prevent yourselves getting switched on defense also.

The Dallas Mavericks are 12-0 ATS (+12.58 ppg) in conference play and coming off a dog in which they shot 47% or less from the field the last game. 

This would indicate play on the Mavericks (+1) over the Suns

https://t.co/XUjhhyNtxp@_JasonLT @Carsobi Luka Doncic's problem is his teammates. 👎
The opponent can look at the Dallas Mavericks as a 1-Man Show on Offense and ignore Doncic's individual scoring total.@dallasmavs @luka7doncic Luka you should learn to pass the ball to your teammates. Learn ball movement.

Once that worked alot, we decided to get help defense for Luka which left an open man so they just found that guy for the bucket. 

Luka was probably tired.@DFWAlex2289 @Chrishitchens11 @dallasmavs @Chime This is the point. He only took 3 shots the entire 3rd quarter just so other can take the ball. If you ask me, I'd rather he just did his thing because his offense is the only one that worksWhy are the Phoenix Suns, after clobbering the Dallas Mavericks 2 games in a row +1.
