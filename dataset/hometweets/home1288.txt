For @MavericksSI, I took a closer look at the Suns' picking apart the Mavericks' defense: https://t.co/p1GSOyJ3Z2Dallas Mavericks really need to up their game, anything other than that will be elimination from the playoff series.The Sun's are a different team when compares to the Jazz.@dallasmavs (@ReggieBullock35 )

In fact, the Mavs could use Pinson right about now.  Very cerebral lengthy defender and playmaker who scored relentlessly in the G League. An X factor that the Suns won‚Äôt plan for.

@dallasmavs @DallasStars@dallasmavs @ESPNNBA @theeagledallas Start Dinwiddie in place of Brunson and see if he can get in the paint early. Maybe that will light a fire under Brunson.

Bet slip link: https://t.co/ORkKZUnSFU https://t.co/SJrDS4bHTIThe Phoenix Suns' defense has made things challenging for the Dallas Mavericks in ways they did not encounter in their first-round matchup against the Utah Jazz. 

For @MavericksSI, I wrote about some key differences the Suns' defense presents:

The Dallas Mavericks are 12-0 ATS (+12.58 ppg) in conference play and coming off a dog in which they shot 47% or less from the field the last game.

Luka was probably tired.@DFWAlex2289 @Chrishitchens11 @dallasmavs @Chime This is the point. He only took 3 shots the entire 3rd quarter just so other can take the ball.
