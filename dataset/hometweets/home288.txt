Really hard to catch games anymore.@scottycoin Vivint signed a 10 year naming rights contract with the Utah jazz in 2015. Safemoon theoretically has to wait 3-4 years to even be able to place a bid for naming rights. The @spurs are CURRENTLY looking for someone to buy the naming rights to their arena. #SanAntonio #SpursIn the latest "How 'Bout This Jazz" podcast episode, @andyblarsen talks the 2 realistic paths for the Utah Jazz to become NBA champions.

Plus, Andy, @tribjazz &amp; @XoelCardenas talk why the Jazz are still unable to fix their recurring issues.
