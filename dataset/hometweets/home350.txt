🤣😂@MarkNisbet11 @Jawz27 @BarnesFanClub @Raptors I agree. The thing with the first is that the Raptors 1st pick is in the teens, with a good year. You can get a new Turner with that, who’s under control for the new timeline. If it’s a bad year, it’s a lottery pick which can become MUCH better than Turner (for only 1.5 yrs).@Raptors @GiantsOfAfrica "Legend"@MikkeyG59 @Raptors @ScottBarnes561 some fans said they wanted suggs but a fuckup knowing the raps system?@CreeperDude17 @Raptors @ScottBarnes561 serious af@whatajs @Raptors @ScottBarnes561 they did?@tdias_5115 @Raptors @ScottBarnes561 RATIOOOOOOMy gf stays stylin @EduvijezS @Raptors #WeTheNorth https://t.co/20VcXM378r@PancakeByOnwenu @Raptors @ScottBarnes561 lmaooooooooooo@JACEH0WARD @Raptors @hieisrequiem @ScottBarnes561 lmfaooooooWhat word best describes Nelson Mandela and his legacy? @GiantsOfAfrica https://t.co/Lio8xnbabsI'm excited about the Toronto Raptors vs. Washington Wizards - Scotiabank Arena, Toronto, ON - Sun, Dec 5.

https://t.co/JTK1WaktAI@keithTu86260263 @YAnunoby @GooD_Us_S @BarnesFanClub @Raptors Agree, but you got realize this like his first season getting meaningful minutes cause the heat didn't play him much. So he is going make mistakes. if he is this good defensively, his offense will come along it's hard to watch but he will learn.@keithTu86260263 @lucky13e @GooD_Us_S @BarnesFanClub @Raptors Ok now you’re just making personal attacks. If you can’t see that Precious is a really talented defender, that’s a you problem.@YAnunoby @keithTu86260263 @GooD_Us_S @BarnesFanClub @Raptors Lol, Nurse loves him so there must be something about him. You know how much he hated playing Matt. And Nurse shut us all down when he played him 😭😂@YAnunoby @lucky13e @GooD_Us_S @BarnesFanClub @Raptors The only elite thing I’ve seen Precious do if fumble the ball lol. I certainly trust Masai and Nurse. I know he’s young, but it feels like too many Raps are trying to make personal leaps/gains. We need more guys to focus on the dirty work imo.@lucky13e @keithTu86260263 @GooD_Us_S @BarnesFanClub @Raptors He has skills on offense, but he just hasn’t figured out how to use those skills to be a good offensive player. He’s really great athlete, he has a bit of a jump shot and he has a really good handle for his position. Once he figures out how to use those skills he’ll be great.@keithTu86260263 @lucky13e @GooD_Us_S @BarnesFanClub @Raptors He definitely competes which is why he’s more playable than a guy like Matt Thomas and he can get his shot off better than Thomas, but he still needs to hit shots.@keithTu86260263 @lucky13e @GooD_Us_S @BarnesFanClub @Raptors He has good size for his position so he doesn’t get overpowered, but he’s not quick enough to guard good wings. He’s not terrible but he’s the worst defender in the rotation currently. He also can dribble a little, but I don’t think he can create his own shot.@YAnunoby @keithTu86260263 @GooD_Us_S @BarnesFanClub @Raptors Ooh, man if he gets better on offence. I think he is going be special. The defense is the hardest part and he has that. The offence is going to come. It's going to take time. He has the perfect guy to learn from dont do too much lol.@keithTu86260263 @lucky13e @YAnunoby @GooD_Us_S @BarnesFanClub @Raptors Wiggins would be trent jr on this team....only position needed is center. The raps are young and arent looking to trade. Another high draft pick and the reign begins.@YAnunoby @lucky13e @GooD_Us_S @BarnesFanClub @Raptors That’s funny because I’ve actually been impressed with Svi’s  D. Plays hard and really moves his feet? He does get overpowered a bit but he’s feisty. His handle is legit and he can create his own shot as well as finish with both hands. The 3’s gonna start dropping soon I hope.@RAWatt4 @BarnesFanClub @Raptors smh, while you're at it why don't you just offer OG &amp; Barnes for JV straight up...@Spanish_Raptors @BarnesFanClub @Raptors I love JV but i not just OG, Fred, Pasal, Barnes &amp; GTJ cannot be part of a deal to get back JV.  I'd offer Boucher, Dragic and Flynn for JV@keithTu86260263 @lucky13e @GooD_Us_S @BarnesFanClub @Raptors Precious’s elite skill is that he is a good (just outside of elite) rim protector while being able to switch better than any center except Bam. That’s a special combination. Right now he’s just terrible on offense. He just needs to learn to survive on O and he’ll be awesome.@visorman30 @BarnesFanClub @Raptors Powell hasnt done anything his whole time in Dallas...why get a player just cuz he's Canadian. Boucher and Birch are better than Powell.@keithTu86260263 @lucky13e @GooD_Us_S @BarnesFanClub @Raptors The thing with Svi is that because he’s not a good defender he really needs to hit shots. That’s basically his one job. I think he’ll start hitting shots eventually, but when he’s not it hurts a lot.@keithTu86260263 @lucky13e @GooD_Us_S @BarnesFanClub @Raptors Yeah, they’re probably not winning anything this year, but if Scottie is as good as we think he is and with the leap Fred has taken, they’ll be competing for titles sooner rather than later. And when they do they’ll want to have Siakam.@Raptors Never gloat for just a game.@keithTu86260263 @lucky13e @GooD_Us_S @BarnesFanClub @Raptors Wiggins is not almost as good as Siakam. Wiggins is fine in a very defined role next to one of the best offensive players ever. Wiggins with Pascal’s role is Minnesota Wiggins who was a very bad player.@zemonix @Raptors Plus it ain't like I play it all day like a nerd, I play it like once a weekNick Saban = Lebron w the Cavs

The Wizards w/G Bradley Beal win this one:WIZARDS 106-104@keithTu86260263 @YAnunoby @GooD_Us_S @BarnesFanClub @Raptors The raptors are not trading siakam so Scottie can take over the team. Scottie already has a lot of usage and siakam helps Scottie get open shots when he draws the double. You get Wiseman Scottie will get double-teamed and lose games. How does that help Scottie develop@zemonix @Raptors Of course the Bucks aren't making it past a healthy Nets team, no team in the league is, but why did they need Kd, Harden, AND Harden to beat Giannis, Khris, and Jrue? Us not having to face the #1 seed Sixers is the worst argument ever, they got beat by the 5th seed for a reason@Raptors @PreciousAchiuwa @Bell The plastic milk bag 🤣 funny how  new players coming here have to adjust to that  Precious played well last game against the Bucks.

https://t.co/qwxwKtQGr4@lucky13e @GooD_Us_S @BarnesFanClub @Raptors 100% agree. Precious is legitimately good on defense. Wiseman isn’t good on either end at the moment.@YAnunoby @GooD_Us_S @BarnesFanClub @Raptors Precious is better than Wiseman now. Imagine how upset they will be when he comes here and stinks it up because he is still young and learning. Raps should never give up siakam for Wiseman.@superfan_nav is a national treasure 🇨🇦🏀@Raptors https://t.co/ulidfxOeB5@DimeUPROXX @apage20 @Raptors This is such a powerful truth and so necessary in today's modern world.@BarnesFanClub @Raptors get towns fro Siakam Goran D.Open gym with Precious was great especially the shopping for bagged milk and Oreos... @Oreo team in Canada give this man an ad deal @raptorsNav Bhatia, the well-known Toronto Raptors 'Superfan,' is going to have his life story told in a new film that will star actor Kal Penn. https://t.co/KigTnnw5ZO@johnkeeshan65 @R_Kekz @BarnesFanClub @Raptors Yuta, Boucher, Bonga for Bagley works. $800 added to cap so stay under tax. Can replace them with Chanpagnie and Johnson who would come in at minimum. It’s close, not sure what their min salary is, but it must be manageable.@Catboyism THE TORONTO RAPTORS LIVERY ASWEL@KevinDWeitzman @R_Kekz @BarnesFanClub @Raptors Don't guess. Go to a trade machine and make it work. Raps are thin enough, without doing a 4 or 5 for 1 for Bagley. We'd have to replace those players, and go into tax to do it. Raps are NOT paying luxury tax this season.

+ We're not giving up draft picks. Bagley has 0 value rn.@johnkeeshan65 @R_Kekz @BarnesFanClub @Raptors Could do Boucher, 2nd rounder or two and filler (eg Bonga, De Colo) for him@LongthorneJess @superfan_nav @Raptors Agreed. Amazing documentary. Your ability to overcome the early struggles are uplifting and inspirational. Very cool you have artifacts in the Hall of Fame. Thanks @superfan_nav for all that you do!@TwiTati @ESPNNBA @Raptors Because bringing that up changes the fact that you said stopped and dismantled even though it was injuries that did that?

But, as @kngprry writes, the lack of high-quality facilities in the country's biggest city tells a troubling story. https://t.co/7yIwOeZeRF@Raptors @PreciousAchiuwa @Bell So good!! Ma fuzzy snacker …I’d watch@R_Kekz @BarnesFanClub @Raptors I don't think it's that good of an idea. His first quarter here, he'd get injured and be out. 🤷‍♀️@Raptors @PreciousAchiuwa @Bell Can't wait to watch! 😀@steve_kostyk @JedArnett1 MLSE owns the Leafs Raptors, Toronto FC and the Argos. They asked for 4-5 Argo players to go to the game at SB Arena. It’s them that should be questioned not the players .Wonder who'll play @Klow7?
