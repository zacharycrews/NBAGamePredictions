In their last 24 seasons, their only playoff appearances were 8 in a row ('98-'06)

Defeated the most by Kobe, (3 playoffs in a row) in that span.

Lost the most playoff series to the Lakers.

The Sacramento Kings trade was 90% completed. Buddy Hield’s 1st agent = Rob Pelinka.For the 16th year in a row, the Sacramento Kings didn't reach the playoffs. Their title drought is now at 71 years 🤯@GoodmanHoops Great adjustments by Coach Self I am still shocked no NBA team (@SacramentoKings @OrlandoMagic @okcthunder etc) is not blowing up his phone !@seaweed_actual @GiffordsCourage @warriors @SacramentoKings @SteveKerr How about mandatory removal of trigger fingers at birth?@wendizzle__ @LegionHoops Kings better be first bc ain’t no one care about Sacramento when we got 3 far superior teams in cali. Also they been just about everywhere so why would it hurt to move to Seattle? Easy league realignment too@AndoliniNFT @SacramentoKings @LazyLionsNFT @NBA Safe travels 👋Future Sacramento King. 😂 https://t.co/GtaMvy44BU@SacramentoKings come bacc to Kansas City… Simple. @nba https://t.co/E9Sb7DGsZO@GiffordsCourage @warriors @SacramentoKings @SteveKerr NOT INTERESTED@kfippin That's a NO BRAINER for the Sacramento Kings..... unless Vlade was running the team. He'd take a project, or go with someone solely because that draft prospect came in for a workout because agents steer clear of basketball hell@AndoliniNFT @SacramentoKings @LazyLionsNFT @NBA Safe flight King 🦁👑 https://t.co/VEJKDMkbWM@nftkal @SacramentoKings @LazyLionsNFT KING! https://t.co/BxavgGjMjn@EricPincus And the X-Factor, Buddy Hield’s salary drops by 2 million dollars each season with 3 seasons for the Lakers not have to worry about re-negotiations.
Lakers screwed up big time by not doing the Sacramento Kings trade. The DeRozan stuff has no meaning to me.Soy los Sacramento Kings del Amort https://t.co/sb9IyzKTGB@SacramentoKings @hbarnes @Divincenzo Harrison Barnes will be a Congressman someday.Tan Tan Tan Tan Tan Tararan Tantan
