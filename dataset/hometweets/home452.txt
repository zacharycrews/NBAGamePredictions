Nothing.@chicagobulls @goaawol Omg this is awesome!! @rwheeler96Look at me, jumping on the @chicagobulls bandwagon almost a full month ago! Sometimes I predict things accurately. Not often, but still. #Bulls https://t.co/ADZXFuqV1S@chicagobulls Lebron James is a poor loser. Gets bested by Derozan and the Bulls. While the rest of the Lakers are congratulating the Bulls like real professionals, Lebron raises his hand and walks off the court. CLASSLESS!! That's the difference between Lebron and Jordan,Class!!@chicagobulls @SamSmithHoops The Lakers really f#cked up not willing to pay DeRozan. Wanted him to take a mid-level exception. The Spurs were willing to do a sign &amp; trade. All the Spurs wanted was Kuzma &amp; a draft pick. Lakers said no &amp; instead gave up 3 good players &amp; draft picks for Westbrook.

LaVine is not out there trying to sabotage the Bulls 4 the sake of his own narrative@CaliKJ1 @adamodinson @chicagobulls Great, how does this matter what so ever to what I said?  How do the Lakers titles decades ago matter any more than the Bears winning titles decades ago?  They are historic franchises, but your team is old and not winning shit for some time. Old men live in the past.@breze_ee @neilfunkfan100 @chicagobulls Not a posterAlex Caruso (2016 PIT, Texas A&amp;M) contributed 17 points (3-5 3-pt) and 9 rebounds to help the Chicago Bulls achieve a 115-110 win over the Los Angeles Lakers.

@OldTakesExposedWoke up to NBA TV showing Lakers @ Bulls from 12/20/88 at Chicago stadium. MJ 42 points@TheMattXu @neilfunkfan100 @chicagobulls People don't say "dunk on to" or "dunk on towards". It's a "dunk on" whenever a defender makes a serious effort to block a dunk but the dunk goes in. The location of the defender isn't a factor. Lebron got dunk'd on.It’s weird to me how before I was ever a @jj_redick fan I was a @chicagobulls fan. Redick retired and I thought I’d have no reason to watch the @NBA anymore but @DeMar_DeRozan and these boys are doing something special this year.

Bulls 115 LAKERS 110. We have lost two straight and are now 16-15 on the season. A big reason why we lost this one was the 19 turnovers. LeBron James finished with 31 points to lead the way.@The_Official_CK @chicagobulls You don’t even own your division lol@KingJames is such a sore looser he couldn’t even stay on the court to congratulate the @chicagobulls on there win.

@Lakers 
@chicagobulls 

Future Finals Match Up 🤔💯@HardensBetta @ZachLaVine @chicagobulls lmao first of all DeRozan is clutch and second of all DeRozan most of the time never draws fouls(like harden which he can't do anymore) he gets fouled and most of the time makes it a and one play. Also how much is harden even averaging? boi ain't scoring that much no more.@chicagobulls swept the lakers champions!@JAGSSUPERBOWL @NBA @chicagobulls Thankfully literally no one cares at all who your goat is@ZachLaVine @chicagobulls How you feelin my boy?Love that win for Demar, Lonzo and Caruso. You KNOW they wanted that one. @chicagobulls@chicagobulls Big win without Zach.@HardensBetta @ZachLaVine @chicagobulls Demar is averaging 6 more points per game then harden and he isn’t a liability on defense@NBA @chicagobulls All LA had to do was get A FUCKING REBOUND. Bron played amazing defense on DeMar on both shots, blocked one, and DeMar just got the second to go in cause he's a mid range murderer.@welch_laquon @chicagobulls @TedLasso Yes please!The Chicago Bulls pick up where they left off, sweeping the season series against the NBA Stars from Christmas Past!

Nothing but upside for me@thedeepdishking @chicagobulls @SociosHoops you talkin' about Zo double dribble? Or giving Westbrook an offensive foul when Caruso was clearly moving?For the Chicago Bulls, Lonzo Ball with 15 points, DeMar DeRozan has 14 points, and Nikola Vucevic added 13 points and seven rebounds. The Bulls are 11 of 13 from the free throw line for 84.6%. The Lakers have made the free throw line only four times and went 2 of 4.@chicagobulls Lebron is arguing with the ref as we read this@puntereinstien @chicagobulls @SociosHoops shit team without Lemickey and his Chuck E Cheese covid ring@chicagobulls Hope he get better 🙏🏾 (sending prayers)@chicagobulls Give McKinnie another 10 day, I guess.@chicagobulls @SociosHoops Happy Vuc is hitting those shots consistently in this game.

I'm just glad the Bulls are back to being worth watching. It's been a rough stretch for several years of winter sports in Chicago. Lol@mikelord821 @chicagobulls So lucky.

Help us cheer on the @chicagobulls tonight as they work towards another WIN! https://t.co/rtDa94ycclZo leads us with 9 points in 1Q. https://t.co/9mnLEB6FjpLAL, playing several lineups that have never shared the court due to all their health and safety protocol absences plus AD’s injury, had 6 turnovers to just 1 for the Bulls. LAL fell down by 10 late in the 1st Q before getting the final 2 buckets to trail 28-22 in Chicago.@SimonovicBurner @chicagobulls @FirstAlert Because it makes no sense to start him when they already have guys like ball, Derozan, and vuch starting. Green and Caruso and starting because of their defense."The Worm" Basketball
