Would be fun to know what the point total would have been with the 3 point line.@MohantyLink Houston Rockets @goldcoastblazeRevenge Game: Chris Paul plays Houston tonight.  He played 116 games in his career for the Rockets.Your Miami Heat leads the league in charges drawn with 101. The next closest team is the Houston Rockets with 54. Kyle Lowry leads the NBA with 25 total, almost half of what the Rockets has as a team.

If this doesn’t describe #HEATCulture then I Don’t know what does! https://t.co/Mq0Qq6rsoo@IceColdColeman The houston rockets have a worse record.  Also OKC, SAC &amp; POR are all trrrbull.  Imagine CJ McCollum dropped the numbers Kyrie did last night &amp; you’ll understand how your narrative surrounding KAI is clouding your view of this team.  When they’re playing together, who beats them?@Mr_Jephreez The best team in the NBA is in Houston today!
Oh no, not the Rockets - who are pathetic &amp; in last in the Western Conf - but rather the Sun's, who are in town playing the lowly Rockets. So it could be like watching the Harlem Globetrotters.

Then again, Ted Cruz is an extremely poor judge of character.@JimMorrison69x @dannymacjr @thehill @SenTedCruz As a @celtics fan, I would say let that be a hard pass for @HoustonRockets fan base. Yes, he had a MONSTER game tonight, but he creates a toxic locker room.@BrahcketScience @FredTJoseph @tedcruz @KyrieIrving @HoustonRockets During the massive cold spell where the power grid failed and kids froze to death in their own beds.@tedcruz @KyrieIrving @HoustonRockets FU Ted🖕🏻 https://t.co/F3Z72FrO3Z@tedcruz @KyrieIrving @HoustonRockets Texas is flat.@tedcruz @KyrieIrving @HoustonRockets No thanks Ted. Kyrie is a head case@tedcruz @All100Senators Why don't the @HoustonRockets just play John Wall?  Oh yeah because it's a dog shit team and no one wants to be there.@tedcruz @KyrieIrving @HoustonRockets Good idea, in Houston the NBA's worst teammate will become completely invisible, much like America's worst senator.@rolandsmartin @tedcruz @KyrieIrving @TAMU @aggiembk @DukeMBB @HoustonRockets how many games has the #Rockets won this yr, Kyris would show his 2 yr old self after 13 straight loses #RolandMartinUnfiltered@tedcruz @KyrieIrving @HoustonRockets I’m glad you didn’t say San Antonio spurs.@tedcruz @KyrieIrving @HoustonRockets Do you do anything?@tedcruz @All100Senators @KyrieIrving @HoustonRockets Free John Wall@Wades_ETH @nbatopshot @riceboy42069 @HoustonRockets @Cezza888 @spurs I love these stories, congratulations!@tedcruz @KyrieIrving @HoustonRockets When your senator has an inflated sense of his importance, he will poke his nose into everything.@tedcruz @KyrieIrving @HoustonRockets Word is you work better with pictures. https://t.co/zphIDF1pKM@FredTJoseph @tedcruz @KyrieIrving @HoustonRockets Isn’t that just when he went on vacation tho? Lol@ericdemamp @tedcruz @KyrieIrving @HoustonRockets Thank you. I’m so sick of conservative pundits and politicians getting wrapped up in sports ball.@tedcruz @KyrieIrving @HoustonRockets Or he could stop being such a baby and just go get the shot.GOP Senator Ted Cruz:

“Come to Houston, play for the Rockets. We'll let you play. He's a hell of a player. Uncle Drew's being benched by asinine Democratic theater.

 https://t.co/Cae4UJvjFS@stackmack As a Rockets fan, it'd be a shame to see Kyrie with a Houston uniform. Paying John Wall to not to play is much better than this.@tedcruz @KyrieIrving @HoustonRockets Why would he move to Texas if it’s Senator doesn’t even like being there? https://t.co/QAwrTiANJzThe Houston Rockets Clint Capela had two chains.@tedcruz @KyrieIrving @HoustonRockets go to bed old man@rolandsmartin @tedcruz @KyrieIrving @TAMU @aggiembk @DukeMBB @HoustonRockets Is there ever an ambulance he won't chase?@tedcruz @KyrieIrving @HoustonRockets Nice deflection, Ted.@Wades_ETH @nbatopshot @riceboy42069 @HoustonRockets @Cezza888 @spurs The 🐐s!!@tedcruz @KyrieIrving @HoustonRockets He doesn’t wanna play for a 17-51 team unfortunatelyDamn….

If NYC still won’t let @KyrieIrving play at home, he sure would look good in a @HoustonRockets uniform! https://t.co/gCz9QjQRkY12 months or so ago, our little #squanchland family would have struggled to bid &amp; win on a single @nbatopshot 1/1 #NFT...

The dude is a poser bitch. He says he roots for the spurs and mavs too (if they aren’t playing Houston).
