Wizards are pretty trash https://t.co/f9JG5ObOPQWaters was drafted 51st in the 2019 NBA Draft by the Boston Celtics. He played 37 games over two seasons, featuring primarily in the G League for the Maine Red Claws.

..not from Washington@Fish_TBW The ONLY place it’s inverted is LA. @McQuaddie brought up that the NHL team in Washington sells out the same stadium that the wizards can’t. This is some weird anti-New Orleans stuff and it’s gotta die.@RyanWardLA Damn Lebron James, see what you got us Laker fans into ?
Washington Wizards found a sucker to take Russell Westbrook’s remaining 91 million dollar salary. That sucker was you Lebron and this is our reward ? https://t.co/qNxl8nJiyg@Lakerscenters @Somethi76756142 @BenStinar Washington Wizards found a sucker to take Russell Westbrook’s remaining 91 million dollar contract. 😂😂😂
That sucker is the Lakers LEAD RECRUITER = Lebron James. https://t.co/Bl28Lyw0IcWhy THE FUCK are the Washington wizards talking shit ? Y’all can suck our dick@Embiid_prodzz why is Washington Wizards not at Washington Dc???@AnnicolsF16 @CJMendenhall24 @LakersNation Divorces with Lebron James are always ugly. 😭😭😭
This Laker divorce will be too. Lakers foolish for trading Washington Wizards for Westbrook. Lebron &amp; Westbrook both OLD-HEADS = worthless to the Lakers future.Booker five assists shy of setting career high. 

Had career-high 14 Dec. 22, 2018 at Washington in a game that went into triple overtime #Wizards won over #Suns, 149-146.@Rybezius If I need a team to give me never ending pain
(Washington Wizards) https://t.co/TxiQv98Esw@Lakerscenters @Somethi76756142 @BenStinar The narrative "Westbrook is a much better 2nd half of the season point guard" came from the Washington Wizards. 😄😄😄  Beal sitting on the bench almost in tears during the 1st Half of last season, drastic improvement once Westbrook was healthy.@Embiid_prodzz Take the Washington Wizards (DC doesn’t deserve anything) and make them the Chicago Lori Lightfoots (or something more catchy) and get the Bulls a new rivalry.#GeneracionNBA Washington wizards@IdiotHunter12 @cheeseburg_ferg @PettyAirJordan MJ had to play Larry Birds Celtics in the first round of the eastern conference with no help.
