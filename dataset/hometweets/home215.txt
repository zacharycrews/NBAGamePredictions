Harden looks like he’s trying to get back into shape after messing up his hamstring last yearMann y’all need to hang that “Brooklyn Nets” shit up😂 https://t.co/yjif2fTf0HIt’s literally one game and the world is ending for some @BrooklynNets fans in the Twitter world. Slow out the gates at 10-5 for a team that lost one of its stars is pretty damn good. What was planned for has had to change on the fly. Still gonna be champs LFG!! #NetsWorldI can’t wait to watch the @BrooklynNets get thier ass kicked tonight @TMKSonYES they deserve to lose every game without @KyrieIrvingIf I take the vaccine . Can @KyrieIrving play @NBA @BrooklynNets ? Y’all gotta stop this .@Bailey_Donecker That’s the issue. Knicks fans are New Yorkers. People in Brooklyn are Knicks fans. Nets fans are from jersey@Sydslidepark @J_Thomas_24 Come on. I completely get what y’all are saying…valid points, especially on gentrification. But “people who live in BK aren’t from NY”? We exist 👋🏽 &amp; Brooklyn has its own history, identity and culture. Nets don’t need to replicate what the Knicks have, nor should they try imo 🤷🏽‍♀️@DonLagreca you could come up with a hundred different reasons or excuses bottom line is this Kyrie Irving does not want to play basketball just get the hell out of here quit embarrassing the Brooklyn Nets your teammates in the NBA@RealJayWilliams @stephenasmith @FirstTake @nets @KyrieIrving Your fake outrage Jay does not get in the way of the facts that SAS broke down. Kyrie bounced on LBJ wanted his own team. He then bounced on Boston after saying he would stay. Then turns around and bounced on his homie in Brooklyn.@cavs @BrooklynNets @BallySportsCLE @betwayusa Ricky Rubio owns New York!Can we all agree that the @BrooklynNets and @Lakers have the exact same issues of having the names that fill 💺 but not really mesh well on the court when it’s needed the most? @stephenasmith if you have to point out @KyrieIrving for not being there also point at the ones who are@stephenasmith @FirstTake @BrooklynNets @StephenCurry30 Golden state is on another planet right now from the rest of the NBA.@TMKSESPN you could come up with any number of reasons or excuses bottom line is Kyrie Irving does not want to play basketball get the hell out of here quit embarrassing the Brooklyn Nets your teammates and the NBA@RealMichaelKay you could come up with a hundred different reasons excuses Etc bottom line Kyrie Irving does not want to play basketball good riddance get the hell out of here and quit embarrassing the Brooklyn Nets and the league"Pick of the Day" #NBA Cleveland #Cavaliers vs Brooklyn #Nets is where the money's at tonight.

Here’s a list:Being a Brooklyn Nets fan must be bad for your mental health@KyrieIrving I really respect your decision 👏 and I support you too but there is another fact...we need you to win #BrooklynNets@Chris_Broussard Brooklyn is not behind the Nets. Not real Brooklyn. Send them back. This is Knicks town.Brooklyn Really Do Need Kyrie! But Ion Think I'd Go That Far Cuz It's Not Like Dis Whole Thing Was Sumthin We We're All Expecting So I Wouldn't Go That Far to Say Kyrie Betrayed KD, but Kyrie Not Playing It Is Kinda Hurting The Nets,
🤦🏾 https://t.co/PzPZD7jxi9The delusion. 

9 years is NOT new.  

These Brooklyn Nets are IRRELEVANT in Brooklyn.    People go to the Barclays to see the other teams’ stars.    Most of the Nets fans I’ve met are from Jerz or Long Island.  

So yes, Nets “fans” were cheering for the other team / players. https://t.co/qL3plDhUnkBEST OF HOUR 1️⃣:

I hardly ever hear from Dub or Brooklyn fans. It’s corny at this point.@ParlayDre @complicated_leo @RealJayWilliams @stephenasmith @BrooklynNets @FirstTake The media is on the Klutch payroll. There's no reason for them to love Steph other than the sheer basketball greatness that Steph constantly shoves down their throat every year.and i think Kyrie Irving is a brilliant basketball player. i’m a fan. however, he’s eating up a lot of cap space without the Nets getting a return on the investment and only they (Brooklyn) can save themselves from this@EddieCheeba Let him continue being the only dog barking about it on TV for the next 3 years na.

That and they don’t play defense which was always Nash’s weakness.@ChrisCanty99 @mikegolicjr if the #Nets want some respect they got to earn it. Since officially becoming the #BrooklynNets, 04/30/12, they’ve made the playoffs 6x (2x with a losing record), won 0 division championships and 0 EC Finals appearances.Because the topic was about the BROOKLYN NETS and that remains the elephant in the room.

So are ppl just supposed to be frauds and magically become nets fans because some bozos decided to bring the team there? That’s not how money spending fandom works, you need some equity..@KesslerEdwards became the 18th Wave to play in the NBA as he made his debut last night with the @BrooklynNets!

They played that well of a game. Now if they play again tmrw with Kyrie that’s a different story Nets might win or still might lose, GSW is goodThe @Cavs hit the road to face the Brooklyn Nets tonight.

Your franchise is a joke.I enjoy every chance I get to shit on the Nets, but I don’t understand this rant 15 games into a season where they’re 10-5. This is a playoff elimination rant. Also, why should Brooklynites be ashamed? The majority of Brooklyn have a team, it’s just not the Nets. https://t.co/pL2ZHnbbTY@BrooklynNets You guys got spanked last night.

Stephen A. Smith is also underestimating Brooklyn Nets GM Sean Marks.@RealJayWilliams @stephenasmith @BrooklynNets @FirstTake LMAO u still mad huhSo from what I heard from media folks today. Nets not making the playoffs, Kyrie betrayed KD, Nets are done. KD made a mistake by going to Brooklyn. 
To those media folks keep that same energy come playoffs time. #NetsWorldI don't get Ashley's "sky is falling" commentary when the nets are right there near the top of the east and were missing a key starter (joe harris) + smallball big (paul Millsap) last night vs the warriors.

Brooklyn Nets – Cleveland Cavaliers
Under 206@stephenasmith You have got to get off @KyrieIrving
back already. The man is doing what he feels is best for him and his family. The @BrooklynNets gotta now do what's best for them.
But a veteran cast with an inexperienced 2nd year coach, was never going to work in my opinion. https://t.co/qVvKkIMoo9@cmacisback16 @TwoOfum @RealJayWilliams @stephenasmith @BrooklynNets @FirstTake Lmao damn I was working. What did he say 😂KD is not gonna ask for a trade, but yikes😳😳😳😳

Cavs, Celtics &amp; now Brooklyn Nets. https://t.co/lmbleym38C@dwight2583 @bayelrey80 @DirtyHawks @RealJayWilliams @stephenasmith @BrooklynNets @FirstTake That is true but same time there are times for criticism due to horrible consistent bad play.After the @BrooklynNets' 18-point home loss to the Warriors, you couldn't help but wonder: What if Kyrie Irving was on the floor?

It sucks as a @nba fan that we can’t watch the nets at full strength but Kyrie made his decisionStephen A. Smith went in on the Brooklyn nets today 😂😂😂😂😂 I ain’t even mad at him either as a New Yorker myself it’s a disgrace... I got enormous respect for the Knicks fan base. Even when their teams pathetic their loyal. &amp; for all the talk about they could win without KY-@diegolucasz1 @RealJayWilliams @stephenasmith @BrooklynNets @FirstTake KD was coming off of an injury. He needed to get kinks out of his body with time, rest, and playing the game bro. Kyrie took time off not due to injury but because he felt like it. There’s a difference.Congratulations to the winners of the @cavs vs @BrooklynNets VIP ticket giveaway!

He signed in aug -sept which is way before we knew the severity of kyrie’s decision. Plus, the regret was in the decision choosing BK, not now.@RealJayWilliams @stephenasmith @BrooklynNets @FirstTake In my opinion he is a follower instead of a leader he should have got Kyrie to go to New York.Kind of has to be Nets fans to make fun. I havent found any except for maybe a handful. Most of them are transplants who dont belong in Brooklyn in the first place but thats a different conversation. https://t.co/ZbXegAIuay@onlydaniell_ @BrooklynNets @TISSOT It’s embarrassing to know you got fake fan base yelling MVP for curry in you’re own home court!

Your HairLine Has Never Been Sharp Enough and the @nyknicks aint been good enough for you to EVER in your LIFE come for BROOKLYN! @BrooklynNets we're building a culture until those two talented idiots came...@FirstTake @stephenasmith And everybody knows the 175 pound benchpress kid @KDTrey5 can’t do it without an all star team. He complained about OKC… If he was as tits as he claims to be they would’ve had enough.  Poor Benedict Arnold.

📸 Getty https://t.co/WsbVVw1exH@DylanRGutierrez @RealJayWilliams @stephenasmith @BrooklynNets @FirstTake This just shows us how curry’s shooting overshadow his playmaking abilities. Curry averages more assist and rebound than kyrie. Don’t even got to mention accoladesI normally let the results speak for themselves but I cannot this time. 

If the Nets call Miami about Tyler Herro for James Harden, he will be on the next flight to Brooklyn. https://t.co/NpuW9frXoZBrooklyn Nets aren’t a threat without Kyrie Irving. It sounds nice saying they have LaMarcus Aldridge, Blake Griffin, Patty Mills &amp; Joe Harris.. If they moved the ball like Golden State. Who’s their Draymond Green?@RuleRomans @RealJayWilliams @stephenasmith @BrooklynNets @FirstTake The Knicks would've given part ownership in the team on top of the max to get KD... Now you stop.@BrooklynNets fans next time y’all decide to cheer for the opps y’all are ban. That’s Ike someone coming to the crib robbing you and you cheering them on. #whatarewedoinghere #wegottadobetter@RealJayWilliams @stephenasmith @BrooklynNets @FirstTake He’s going to say “you’re full of it bro” 🤣🤣🤣🤣@AaronLester22 @RealJayWilliams @stephenasmith @BrooklynNets @FirstTake Knicks didn’t want to pay him max…Stop@jacks365 @shwinnypooh He chose this life. Robin wasn’t a net fan. He been a Lebron Stan for years , and chose Brooklyn as a NY transplant from Maryland. Nobody crying tears for you boy .Brooklyn nets arena chanted mvp for wardelll 🌚Watching that Amazing Steph Curry in Brooklyn last night and the fans chanting MVP for HIM not KD....Nets need to boot that selfish Kyrie Irving out; sitting on his ass while the Nets suffer.  KD made a huge mistake leaving GSW and I hope they win it all!  And, Clay returns soon.Trade for Ben Simmons @BrooklynNetsKevin Durant made a massive mistake leaving Golden State for the Brooklyn Nets. He left one of the most stable organizations led by one of the best leaders in the world for Brooklyn to bet on Kyrie Irving’s commitment and James Harden’s longevity. That’s going to haunt his legacy@jcmemilt @stephenasmith I don't really believe KD should get a pass, i'm talking about the context in which Stephen A made the statement about the Brooklyn Nets. He made the prediction that they'd be good under the pretense that they'd have a top-5ish player on their team including KD'We have championship DNA,' says Steph Curry after domination of Brooklyn Nets https://t.co/qhYT0vCMuZThe Brooklyn Nets are like the Chargers now. No home court advantage.@JohnGPettus @ESPNNBA @BrooklynNets Need more challengesBarclays cheered harder for steph than they’ve cheered for the Nets the entire season. But Brooklyn runs NY 😂 https://t.co/KUVYeImuMQ@ohhenryTOTFC @RealJayWilliams @stephenasmith @BrooklynNets @FirstTake Did he win? Because I remember seeing Giannis holding the trophy at the end of the playoffs... KD was lucky to get the rings he did. He jumped on the GS bandwagon after they spanked him in the WC Finals. He's a follower. It's ok that he is. He got two rings out of it.@RealJayWilliams @stephenasmith @BrooklynNets @FirstTake KD left the Warriors because he felt the fans love Steph more. So, what happened last night? Did you not hear loud “MVP”chants for @StephenCurry30 in BKN? #StephBetterNets fans chanting MVP for Steph while KD sitting on the bench getting blown out by the warriors… in Brooklyn… damn that’s gotta sting@FirstTake @stephenasmith What do you think about KD staying in Brooklyn and the Nets getting rid of Kyrie. Allowing KD to be the man and building his own culture and team for the city of Brooklyn?@BrooklynNets ‘wErE gOnNa wIn tHe cHaMpIoNsHiP tHiS yEaR’ 🤣🤣🤣Brooklyn nets fans were chanting “mvp” for Steph curry last night 😂😂😂 that’s why the nets will never be New York’s team 
Them boys got no fansI getting sick of hearing about ESPN with this KYRIE IRVING story over &amp; over.

What else you gotta say?Curry getting MVP chants IN Brooklyn was DISRESPECTFUL 😂

Feel sorry for Nets &amp; KD. They should be ashamed.@StephenCurry30 so good he had yall stars sitting on the bench for 8 mins they just gave up @BrooklynNets https://t.co/FfZZoNMUP5Right, @stephenasmith.

This is a dumb tweet@RealJayWilliams @stephenasmith @BrooklynNets @FirstTake He was anti KD going to nets because he wanted him a knicks he was harder on KD than anyone when he went to the warriors and he is anti Kyrie because the guy get paid millions and never shows up for work@BrooklynNets Let kyrie play or else@AaronLester22 @RealJayWilliams @stephenasmith @BrooklynNets @FirstTake Have you seen Mr Harden play this year?@BrooklynNets Let Kyrie play@RatiodbyKD @BrooklynNets Common W@cbreezy0013 @_CurryGOAT @BrooklynNets Warriors own rockets soooo?@JHarden13 5 turnovers &amp; @BrooklynNets ball movement in the 2nd Half right along with @KDTrey5 scoring less than 20 points cost us the game.

You haters and doubters are the fuel for us LOL@RealJayWilliams @stephenasmith @BrooklynNets @FirstTake Jay you looking REAL suspect right now for this lolLike most decent crowds New York (Knicks fans in particular) always show love to a good performance, but wat that Brooklyn crowd was doing for Steph last night was disgusting LOL i would've hated that as a Nets playerArjee smith join the Brooklyn nets roster team eastern conference game at Barclays center Brooklyn in the house 🏠 Arjee’s Brooklyn playground 🏀 court. https://t.co/v95nBsYxcLYurrr @KDTrey5 @JHarden13 @BrooklynNets the crowd gonna only get better last night definitely was looking real treacherous 🥴

Sb: Give them some time to become die hard fans cause chanting MVP to the opponent definitely ain’t “Brooklyn” like@HAC_Foot @NBA @nyknicks @warriors @BrooklynNets Michael Ray Richardson@BrooklynNets Trade kyrieI'll bring it up again... maybe just maybe Steve Nash isn't the right coach for the Brooklyn Nets. #NBATwitter@stephenasmith is wrong. @KyrieIrving didn’t betray @KDTrey5 . @KDTrey5 and the @BrooklynNets betrayed @KyrieIrving   #standtogether #hisrighttochoose@RealJayWilliams @stephenasmith @BrooklynNets @FirstTake There’s nothing Jay can say. On national TV they were cheering for the OTHER guy 😂.The Brooklyn Nets have fans? https://t.co/m3EkPfCQae@DirtyHawks @yghass @RealJayWilliams @stephenasmith @BrooklynNets @FirstTake Ngl if KD was gonna leave GS, Knicks should’ve been it.  He would’ve been worshipped in MSG. Bro the MSG home games would have KD every night?!? 😂 🤣@FirstTake @stephenasmith It's facts. I've never seen a more pathetic fanbase than the Brooklyn Nets. It's always dead in the BarclaydEXCUSES. NJ Is Not Far From Brooklyn, And Those Loyal Jersey Residents Traveled To The Barclays On Many Occasions To Watch The Nets. Truth Of The Matter Is In The State Of New York, Its All About The KNICKS Only. #NewYorkForever https://t.co/JBvMJKuLzl@FirstTake @stephenasmith The reason why Brooklyn borough not standing up for the Nets is cuz we are all Knick fans! Check us out at the Garden!@FirstTake @stephenasmith 😂😂 fact is all the Brooklyn Basketball fans are Knicks fans. Anybody that lives in Brooklyn that roots for the Nets are just temporary residents. F the Nets and F Kyrie Irvin. Boo the Crap out of those players next time they step on the court.I’m still pissed at yesterdays @BrooklynNets game smh 🤦🏾‍♂️@Ntilikina11Fan That just shows you the Brooklyn Nets are second fiddle to the New York Knicks!!!!

As a Knicks fan I do remember the garden chanting Kobe Bryant‘s name and some MVP chance when he dropped 61@FirstTake @stephenasmith And the whole Kevin Durant didn't have any help narrative is bullshit the whole team is a super team with or without Kyrie Irving what I'm pissed off at is those fucking fans in Brooklyn cheering for Stephen Curry! Net fans aren't really New York fans. These are Super Team fans https://t.co/HALWAi0j1N@stephenasmith went off on the @BrooklynNets 😂 that team stinks@RealJayWilliams @stephenasmith @BrooklynNets @FirstTake Can somebody explain???

Sad #NetsWorld@FirstTake @stephenasmith Why is he mad at the people of Brooklyn? Most of them are Knicks fans and rooted for the Knicks before the Nets moved to Brooklyn. Why would they switch teams? Nets should have moved to Seattle or another city that needed a basketball team.@robinlundberg The Nets have been in Brooklyn for nearly a decade, dawg@logi_berra @mdotfree @DylanRGutierrez @RealJayWilliams @stephenasmith @BrooklynNets @FirstTake If that’s his reason for leaving Steph off… he better take Dame and Kyrie off the graphic too. 
Steph has more APG over his career than either guy. And more RPG too.

Soooooo… yah. LolKlay Thompson reacts to Warriors blowout win over Brooklyn Nets, 117-99 https://t.co/P64QOEJ3TE@itsjkav @blakegriffin23 @BrooklynNets First of all, that's a dope illustration.  Secondly, it's cool that you put his 3-point % on the shirt.@TheWrestleClan Oh absolutely. The Barclays is not the epicenter of NY. It will always be MSG. But that's due to where it was built, the time it was built, who it's for, and etc. Brooklyn Nets &amp; Barclays didn't arrive when Brooklyn was  *BROOKLYN*.@FirstTake Stephen A just make the point about KD, Kyrie and Harden. They each can’t carry a team. Kobe did it, MJ did it, Steph did it with great supporting cast. So Kobe is better than KD, Kyrie, Harden, Steph is better than KD, Kyrie and Harden. @Lakers @BrooklynNets @warriorsBrooklyn Nets need to trade James Harden / Kyrie Irving for basketball players who can help Kevin Durant win a NBA championship. https://t.co/1c1aQsGABD@DirtyHawks @yghass @RealJayWilliams @stephenasmith @BrooklynNets @FirstTake Knicks aren’t good lol@MeelzTV Its extremely early but hes not lying about the Nets not having any semblance of fan culture or KD not having help

you are letting your brothers from the @BrooklynNets get beat, excuse me i was being modest, get ANNIHILATED by a team who still doesn’t have the second best 3pt shooter in the league.@DylanRGutierrez @RealJayWilliams @stephenasmith @BrooklynNets @FirstTake Obviously Jeff Teague&gt;Curry@notorioustei @BrooklynNets @ericadamsfornyc Aw man he used to be so good back in the day@mdotfree @DylanRGutierrez @RealJayWilliams @stephenasmith @BrooklynNets @FirstTake Then he shouldn't be on television talking about basketball@BrooklynNets have to get Kyrie back or cut him.. they need a PG asap.. @KDTrey5 can’t do it all. But once @JHarden13 get it together they should be just fine he got to adjust to that rule change.. I’m still taking them out the east.The joy of the Knicks being the story in NY after the Nets got all those free agents is amazing. It’s not surprising to real Knick fans. That rat box in Brooklyn was chanting MVP for CURRY in their building while the warriors were killing them! That would NEVER happens at MSG!I told y’all , Brooklyn Nets and PSG are both terrible teams https://t.co/XWZUsfWhe0@RealJayWilliams @stephenasmith @BrooklynNets @FirstTake Still caping for Kyrie, huh?

The three ball looked nice, especially the second one which saw a quick and relatively release despite the close out. https://t.co/tpos32CbJA@ESPNNBA @BrooklynNets Too bad he missed the free throw😂😂😂😂@FirstTake @stephenasmith Brooklyn Nets have only loss 5 games 🙄 some of the stuff you're saying may be right but saying KD has no help is bullshitStephen A. Smith Wants Kyrie Irving to Get Cut, Is Sickened By Disgraceful Brooklyn Nets https://t.co/IJx0SVH4ypHe's right. Truthfully, those "fans" aren't from Brooklyn. If you know what's going on. Still a trash fanbase, and I'm a Nets fan. https://t.co/maGpBMo9hG@mdotfree @DylanRGutierrez @RealJayWilliams @stephenasmith @BrooklynNets @FirstTake Then, Draymond  should've been there as the PG.I can only disagree with 1 point. He didn’t make the wrong choice in joining the #BrooklynNets, he made the wrong choice trusting Kyrie https://t.co/VidhjGJTOr@stephenasmith The nba is money and accolades! Not emotions. Whatever emotionally sent KD packing. You gotta work through that! And i know the @BrooklynNets feel some type of way about how @KyrieIrving handling things. “WHY YOU BEING WIERD TO THEM”@stephenasmith Stephen please calm down. How could you say that KD does not have help? So the Golden states that played Brooklyn Nets yesterday had more help. Please save that nonsense.🗣️ Stephen A. Smith made a bold statement that Durant made a wrong decision by going to the Nets! That Kyrie Irving betrayed him! 👀

Thoughts? 🤔

No. So they already had a base. Yes it's growing, but it's growing as much cause they're a playoff team.

We see you flip flop Jay!@DylanRGutierrez @RealJayWilliams @stephenasmith @BrooklynNets @FirstTake Lmao no StephThis goes without saying but... if the Nets don't win a championship this year, Harden and KD will both be leaving Brooklyn.@ExCossack @stephenasmith @FirstTake @BrooklynNets @StephenCurry30 It was that people wrote bad things about him that made him leave they just hated his move but it was his right to go to GSW he was a free agentThis Game Got Outta Hand In The 2nd Half. #KevinDurant #KD #StephenCurry #ChefCurry #BrooklynNets #GoldenStateWarriors #NBAOnTNT #NBA75 #NBA2K22 #NBATwitter #NBATwitterLive #NBABasketball #NBA https://t.co/tdVAzxiF61@RealJayWilliams @stephenasmith @BrooklynNets @FirstTake Jay Will gone get fired lmaoooo@yghass @RealJayWilliams @stephenasmith @BrooklynNets @FirstTake Everyone knows he left the Warriors because he was tired of sharing the limelight with Steph &amp; not getting his “credit” for winning 2 rings @KDTrey5 may have the softest ego of any superstar athlete.@RealJayWilliams @stephenasmith @BrooklynNets @FirstTake Hey JayWill since your god LeGONE and his lakers are in trouble you are making stories so not to be critisized with your LeGONE...What justification you have now for Kyrie...
You are marked to be an opponent of those putting MJ ahead of your god LeGONE..@RealJayWilliams @stephenasmith @BrooklynNets @FirstTake This made any opinion you might have null and void my guy. 😂 https://t.co/nY6Ntf5DiQ@vngSen @5starman11 @yghass @RealJayWilliams @stephenasmith @BrooklynNets @FirstTake Facts highest paid dude at ESPN he pulls a lot of strings there of all the things he is the puppet master@Meyers4Six @stephenasmith @FirstTake @BrooklynNets @StephenCurry30 On a normal night yeah but KD couldn’t get anything to go down in the second half. Idk what it was they said he has a shoulder injury that he’s been playing through so maybe that was it. Also with the way Curry played pretty much making every 3 he took it woulda been very toughI wake up and I see this

Finally this needed to be said to YOU NETS "FANS"

The MVP Steph Curry chants was just outrageous the "Klays"

Did James Harden get traded last night before the game? And as far as Kyrie betraying KD, does this mean KD is a follower not a leader? He's a grown man he could've went to the Knicks on his own.@masoncarswell12 @David_Imondi @robinlundberg Lol you’re not from ny so you dont understand and are solely looking at distance. I live in brooklyn. We have no connection to jersey and never thought about rooting for the nets. It’s a diff market as far as we’re concerned15 games in, Brooklyn is 3rd seed, 10-5 and the Nets are apparently a horrible team, with no good players, and KD made a mistake... 

I hate the NBA mediaWhole Brooklyn Nets team gotta line up to fade Screamin A Smith after this. https://t.co/KP3qlVpalE@BrooklynNets I still love you even tho Curry was just sinking 3s all night. 🖤🤍🖤🤍@ThisJustInD @David_Imondi @robinlundberg It absolutely is a new fanbase.

#AllFly@robinlundberg It’s because the fanbase doesn’t match the real authentic overall culture of hoops in Brooklyn. It’s only going to get worse and easy for away teams to come and play at because nets game are a “to do” thing compared to actually rooting for them.@robinlundberg I dunno, it doesn’t seem either new or essentially new.

He gone. The Warriors are now playing how they played before KD got there. Full of Joy and sharing the ball. Having a good time. Even though Steph THE one, he doesn't care who gets the shine as long as they win. KD wanted ALL the shine while there. Hurry back Klay!😙@stephenasmith @FirstTake @BrooklynNets @StephenCurry30 He’s not a Coach@Jk7Ny @stephenasmith @FirstTake @BrooklynNets @StephenCurry30 💯.  I’d be so pissed if I were KD.  KD came to BK to play with him and he’s just choosing to not play.  Wiggins didn’t want the shot but he manned up.  Kyrie is dumb and selfish….dude thinks the earth is flatWatching the @warriors at @BrooklynNets game last night sounded like the Warriors were at home... if ya don't believe @StephenCurry30 is the wave this year, then... 🤷🏽‍♂️@BrooklynNets AND MORE 2 COME,ALL HAIL,KD!LION+G.O.A.T.=KD,Followed by haters,hate on... y'all the 🐍 s,like I said before,WHY DO U FOLLOW HIM(KD)If he so fake.yall fake.. dummies.James Harden goes 3-4 in the 3rd qtr, but because Durant goes 0-8. Nash sits them BOTH down the 4th qtr? @BrooklynNets Harden has proved he can beat the warriors by himself, even with Eric Gordon and Capella against a fully healthy KD steph and klayBut now he can't show up KD?The Brooklyn nets i don't know what to say about them. Maybe they need to make a trade some of their bench players. Kevin Durant may want to think about going to another team like your boys the new york knicks or even la and play with anthony davis when lebron retires.@David_Imondi @robinlundberg Very few adults who live in Brooklyn were simply going to just become Nets fans.  So the base they are growing are young kids who hopefully grow up and stay Nets fans.  Add that to the small NJ fan base and thats the current fan base.@BrooklynNets Ya'll got this, fellas!

Nash sat KD down to light a fire because KD knows he F’D up and the only way he can correct his mistake is to put Brooklyn on his shoulders. I’m watching!@evan_williams_ @Potbellypiglet @Dancoviss @StevenStuntin @BrooklynNets The very next year KD went down in game 4 in the 1st half while Houston was up, the Warriors won that game and the next 2 without him. Houston was fully healthy. Kill that noiseKYRIE IRVING - THE LEADER OF THE BROOKLYN NETS. Kyrie told them get KD and Harden. Kyrie is the one who said they don’t need a coach. Kyrie decided Harden will play the 1. Kyrie decides when he wants to practice or play. Kyrie is the Brooklyn Nets. I tried to tell you all.I think Donavan Mitchell should go to the @BrooklynNets. That’s only if Kyrie don’t come backI don't see the Brooklyn Nets winning the championship without Kyrie.We held the Brooklyn Nets to under 100 points.. Herh do you know what that means?

Facts@stephenasmith @FirstTake @BrooklynNets @StephenCurry30 Shut up what’s he gonna say tomorrow the warriors won’t lose another game for 5 yearsCouple that with the fact that we’re playing the Nets in Brooklyn tomorrow night combined with the Nets getting spanked by Golden State tonight, Cavs are probably headed for a skid. Hopefully they don’t fall off a cliff defensively speaking. It’s been such a fun start.@dawudm32 @chefcurry30_szn @FinalsKyrie @BrooklynNets Tell the guy I replied to be humble.

It's one game. Their same swarming defense lost to the Charlotte Hornets 2 days ago. They were ready for Brooklyn tonight &amp; Brooklyn didn't match them. We'll see if they can do it again in Cali.Thoughts for @KDTrey5’s @BrooklynNets: 2 individuals want the ball in crunch time and often, easier to defend, need more team passing, movement, find the wide open shots. Double team means open teammate. Forget stats, need a TEAM leader to win it all. 😉@silmaj9 @stephenasmith @FirstTake @BrooklynNets @StephenCurry30 Especially when they have KD who was debatably 1a/1b with Steph in the mvp race before this game.@TheUnderKing1 @warriors @BrooklynNets Great under 💚💵 nets didnt show up@sp_3521 @FinalsKyrie @BrooklynNets man you warrior fans been quiet for 3 years , keep it that way don’t get all loud now@JohnLay80223220 @LeGoatKittle @stephenasmith @FirstTake @BrooklynNets @StephenCurry30 Lebron can’t either@BrooklynNets I think KD is the #BPITW but until BKN learns how to PLAY HARD &amp; COMPETE on the defensive end they won't even beat good teams... don't even talk about a championship....Nash: Nets Not Elite Yet: Brooklyn HC doesn't think his team is 'in that category' with Warriors, Heat, Bulls, Bucks: 'We got a lot of work to do'@stephenasmith @FirstTake @BrooklynNets @StephenCurry30 In my Stephen A voice 🗣KD left the Golden State Warriors because Kyrrrrrrie told him let’s play together……and he actually listened to him 🤪🤪😂💀@justkoiii @stephenasmith @FirstTake @BrooklynNets @StephenCurry30 @AtLastLenny It’s about to get spooky in the west@stephenasmith @FirstTake @BrooklynNets @StephenCurry30 I MEAN DAMN@Rimuruismydaddy @jamiemurt64 @silmaj9 @stephenasmith @FirstTake @BrooklynNets @StephenCurry30 I think first quarter.

Steph Curry: nine 3s, Warriors thump Nets, best record in NBA

Kyrie Irving: posted this on IG: https://t.co/m7Pwowq9HgWould need a re-watch, but sense is that missed shots at the rim from the Brooklyn Nets led to a ton of transition opportunities for the Golden State Warriors.

Missed layups can be death when teams are hitting ahead, and pushing with numbers advantage.For what it's worth for Brooklyn fans: Last year, the Nets were losing by double digits at home to the Thunder, Mavs, and Hawks.

Why you giving up brooklyn?This @warriors @BrooklynNets game though. 😳 I hope this is the Warriors championship team I’ve missed. Klay need to come on back and seal the deal.😌Love seeing @StephenCurry30 put it on @KDTrey5 and the @BrooklynNets!!! 😉😂👏🏾@BrooklynNets Steve Nash taken to school by Kerr of coaching damnNets letting Curry cook them by himself . Brooklyn gives 2005 Oklahoma City thunder vibes@ESPNNBA @BrooklynNets Wasn’t really a foul, but nice play!The Dubs are whooping the Nets. In Brooklyn.

Does that count as a “statement win”?

Because apparently that’s what this team needed to do to be taken seriously.@ESPNNBA @BrooklynNets Only this 4 pts play was legit. Other points were all flopping to get to charity stripe.The Brooklyn Nets are still my title pick, and I'd pick the Milwaukee Bucks over any team in the West as of now, but in terms of box-checking and meeting criteria, the Golden State Warriors have met every standard we look for in a contender

Had them a notch below that -&gt; Too LowJust a reminder that it is only game 15 for the Brooklyn Nets and they get back to work tomorrow night

Especially in matchups like this where the opposing team has weapons. same thing happened with the bulls a week or so ago@BrooklynNets When y’all sacking Steve Nash ?

He isn’t worth what the @BrooklynNets gave up .@KDTreeey5 @BrooklynNets kyrie aint gon do shit lmaoo it'll just worsen yo defenseI like how Nash waits until the game is out of hand to play LMA and Cam Thomas….Nash is still in way over his head #BrooklynNets@quintin7811 @BrooklynNets This is how I felt last night with the Rams@MetsDelusional @BrooklynNets Uhm to get to the playoffs?Love that timeout from Steve Kerr.

Call it at 18, instead of 12-14.

If the Golden State Warriors can put a 4-0 or 6-0 spurt following the T.O., I think the Brooklyn Nets throw in the towel on this one.@jonnygamblejg @BrooklynNets Nah just restating this@BrooklynNets Iguodala just hit a buzzer beater we lostAll #nba teams should play through their adversity #Nets not go sit on the bench to sulk or grumble and nitpick.

The only thing I would have been interested in here was Nets -3 and even that was dubious because Curry can ruin any close game by simply going supernova. However, you can say the same about both Durant and Harden if you liked the GSW side.Final del primer cuarto. Brooklyn Nets 34-31 Golden State Warriors

#DubNationEnd of the first Quarter @BrooklynNets lead the @warriors 34-31. Still plenty of basketball left so this game’s really up in the air.

The Nets lead the Warriors 34-31 at the end of the first quarter.

Brooklyn shot 10-of-11 (90.9%) from the FT line in the opening period, the team's most FTM/FTA in a first quarter this season.End of the first quarter: Nets lead the Warriors 34-31. This has been a ball. Curry and Durant each have 12 and the game is pretty even. Golden State has seven bench points to the Nets zero. Brooklyn can only go nine deep with no Millsap, Harris or Claxton.The #NBA superstars have come to play tonight. Stephen Curry and Kevin Durant were the top scorers in the first quarter with 12, while James Harden had 8 in #Brooklyn Nets up 34-31 #NBA75  #DubNation  #NBATwitter https://t.co/DysL7bEYMR#Brooklyn Nets - Golden State Warriors ★ #1er cuarto terminado: 34 - 31 by: #SofaScoreEnd of 1st QTR: Nets 34, Warriors 31
