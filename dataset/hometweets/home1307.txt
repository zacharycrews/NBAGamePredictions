Max Strus went through two colleges, two teams, and a torn ACL on his way to becoming a starter for the Miami Heat, helping the team take off.

Sorry it’s so late, but I’m now in for 5u on the UNDER 207 in Heat and Celtics game. I really don’t see either team cracking 100 this game, and if Boston wins it’s not like they crack 105+ in Miami. Give me the under.Simple 4-teamer for today.. just slight…

Miami is at home tonight and is already up 1-0 on Celtics.

Do that many people still think the Heat are not legit?1u - Miami Heat -1.5 #HEATCulture 

I’m on the Heat to win this game at home. It’s going to be closer than last match but I still think the Heat pull it off. I feel like the home team continues to win games.

https://t.co/RMqmViZdcL5/7... secret here that the Miami Heat are 7-0 at home in this year's playoffs. There has already begun talk from pundits and fans of the NBA of Jimmy Butler and the Heat returning to the NBA finals again this year and that the Heat are far superior after a convincing game...3/7  ...lock on Jimmy Butler &amp; limit him a bit here.

Last round, the Boston Celtics faced an above average defense in Milwaukee, no doubt, but let's not forget this Miami Heat team had a higher defensive rating in the regular season than that of the Bucks. Their team defense...MAVERICKS and HEAT will win GAME 2!!!  @MiamiHEAT @dallasmavs@dickspit69 Heat??? You have bay blood lol! But fuck yeahhh if you really end up in Miami ever tho hit me upTonights picks !!

#LEGENDoftheMiamiHEAT #NBA75@Jplatt15 @PrioritySports @MiamiHEAT Don’t forget about the politics involved too. Sometimes it’s who you know on these coaching staffs and in these front offices. Cam Payne of the Phoenix Suns is a prime example. If it weren’t for having a relationship with Monty Williams, dude would still be overseas.I just want Celtics fans to know I accept cashapp, Zelle, PayPal, green dot, check or cash because y’all are NOT beating Miami in a 7 game series. The Heat “team” defense is way too good.@fq32t235t25 @Nicholas493 @MiamiHEAT That’s very nice of them honestly@Magnusson32 @AlfredSpellman @MiamiHEAT I would say if they refused to wear their body armor because of their terrible political views that shouldn't count either.

Public servants who put their politics before their own, their colleagues and the public's safety aren't public servants.C'mon @celtics

Also if you think assist totals equate to complete playmaking ability then John Stockton is the best player maker of all time to you. Playmaking is so much more than assist numbers dawg watch hoopsAy @MiamiHEAT he need to be on the list https://t.co/LU8wWnDUoxDoes the Heat go up 2-0, or does Boston make the series even? 🤑 Who is your money on? https://t.co/DdXBljadMk #nbatwitter #miamiheat #bostoncelticsCoach Spol is very underrated when it comes to motivating his players. People forget that he bumped shoulders on purpose with LeBron in year two in Miami when the Heat were not playing well. He’s a very underrated and under appreciated coach. https://t.co/VeryvdRvMNWed Sports recap: 1-2=-0.95units

#MiamiHeat⚡️Zeus' Tips - May 20th🏀

Celtics🍀 @ Heat🔥

Miami showed up in Game 1 and Boston was not ready for the energy or athleticism the Heat brought.
Even though it didn't pay off last time I still like the Under 207.5 here but I'll go ATS.
But my pick:

Miami -3.5As i've been checking the #ECF &amp; #WCF of the #NBAPlayoffs , i noticed just now that there is no off day. With that fact, i am taking @MiamiHEAT and @warriors to reach the #NBAFinals2022 by sole reason of exhaustionJimmy Butler won't have 40 pts next game. Horford &amp; Smart will be back. @celtics will out tough &amp; outscore the @MiamiHEAT Jimmy don't have Ruff Riders with him. Strus, Vincent, and Herro? GTFOH 😂 😂 😂 Celtics in 6.

Jimmy Butler outscored Boston by himself, 17-to-14, in the quarter.

No matter the politics ain't this something that most would let slide?@IMGNBerrios @NBA @MiamiHEAT @JimmyButler Blazers in 😂😂@MiamiHEAT @JimmyButler I pass by this pair of shoes and my dawgs ashes before each playoff game

Dawg mentality https://t.co/KpTboWuo57@LeBatardShow want “us” to care about the @MiamiHEAT?!…Have someone interview Jimmy Butler,&amp; Rachel Nichols together….&amp; ask them about the “exclusive” interview feature,&amp; the reported-“bumps up n the night” coming from his “bubble hotel room,&amp; her whereabouts that night?!-🤷🏿‍♂️😏@NBAonTNT THE REAL DPOY PLAYS FOR THE MIAMI HEAT @Bam1of1📣 New Podcast!

#DuncanRobinson #MiamiHeat #NBA #NBAPlayoffsI love this Miami Heat team almost more than the Big 3 Heat team.. https://t.co/8kMB2FsfZe@RandiGeff @MChonger @celtics @MiamiHEAT Any team with Boban gets my support!Y’all hate on my team so I won’t be watching your team in the playoffs only the Miami Heat, because y’all disrespect them just as much as the Suns@99JAMZ 
@DJLuckyC 
@shejhercules 
It's been a minute. I miss y'all. I'm on with y'all tonight. Need something for my teams. 
@MiamiHEAT stay on track.
@FlaPanthers 
@StLouisBlues dance it off. Get back on track.
#Let'$GetIt!!!No one thought Dirk and the Mavs were beating that Miami Heat team either.. Remember that.Love watching aggressive, physical, and proactive defenses like the Miami Heat. https://t.co/OcdadCmj4lMy squad took game 1 @MiamiHEAT  in 6If the #MiamiHeat aren't going to play #DuncanRobinson, let him do his #Podcast, The Long Shot. You don't bench a player after they win an NBA Playoff game with 27 points. I'm guessing The Heat pressured Duncan Robinson to not appear on his Podcast during the Playoffs@just_cena_ok @NBA @MiamiHEAT @JimmyButler Bucks in 8! 😂😂@MelissasProduce @celtics @MiamiHEAT @warriors @dallasmavs @NBA Heat and mavs! @lVlelissa33 @JeffreyCope20@brockluh @NBA @MiamiHEAT Horford and Smart will return.  It’s also unlikely the celts will have another 3rd quarter like that - tatum pretty much just handing the ball over and then walking back on D.@GiselleSports @MiamiHEAT The best in the business! Their content is unmatched!!! Thank you for sharing :)@SethR94 @MiamiHEAT @celtics Miami one is awesome. Celtics is nice too, but it’s just hard to improve on their existing uniforms! LolTucker’s tenacity, player-led adjustments empower Butler, Miami Heat https://t.co/QcV71n1asD@Lang250 @NBAonTNT He wasn't playing because he was with the Miami Heat@SchaeferIan03 @mcuban @MiamiHEAT Lmao lmao

Only team that gets no pass for injuries is Miami. Lowrys been out most of the playoffsPayton Pritchard plays his second playoff game against the Miami Heat in 24 hours.@BleacherReport If I were the Celtics I be telling these fake credits to shut up &amp; stop giving a talented Heat team more motivation. Miami lives for this moments when credits are trying to downplay thier achievements. Jimmy now is going to score 50 points on the Celtics tomorrow to shut u all@GiselleSports @MiamiHEAT They do great work! Thanks for sharing and recognizing them! #HEATCulture1st time we see Miami using Butler as a screener to attack Pritchard—a huge theme for the Heat down the stretch. Jimmy's such a versatile star, man.

@MG_Schindler touched briefly on screener-Jimmy in his piece, and I believe we'll have additional words on @basketbllnews tomorrow https://t.co/KgpirPtzFm@MChonger I’d like them both to lose if that’s not too much to ask. Let’s just have @celtics vs @MiamiHEAT finalsMiami Heat game tomorrow I’m so excited to be in that arena for the first time https://t.co/FGn9SVDuGD@JuliusCesar25 @JimmyButler What does he have against the Heat? Other than we spanked his Sixers and Shaq &amp; DWade both got rings in Miami.Fire on @NBAonTNT w @JimmyButler convo. Can anyone stop a GREAT player? @SHAQ vs. Charles AGAIN. @TheJetOnTNT &amp; @DwayneWade24x7 chillin' on the sidelines eatin' popcorn. #respect #NBAPlayoffs @NBA @MiamiHEAT https://t.co/d9Tcw1Bu5ZBoston Celtics: Boston #Celtics fall to Miami #Heat 118-107 in Game 1, blowing lead in disastrous third quarter https://t.co/6urYeVQBqnBest ESPN's video! 
I remember this moment!
#MiamiHeat @MiamiHEAT 🔥#305#4evr

#TikTok https://t.co/rXrhc2tXXb@NBAonTNT @MiamiHEAT Great game for Butler, and let’s not overreact.  Miami did what they needed to do and that’s to protect home court.  THero to state that Cs was desperate to win on the road? CMON, dude it’s just one game.@NBA I'm all for safety I'm all for vaccines. I'm all for common sense. But talk about straight up missing the mark in the ECF. The leagues COVID policy is antiquated. It should be a working document. Robbing the @celtics  of a starting 5 player vs @MiamiHEAT the fix is in Mafia!Celtics players forgotten that the Miami Heat watch Videos too, they know the Celtics players Tendencies. Celtics players got Bad Habits, tendencies. Creating passing Lanes are Awful, driving &amp; or Spinning out of Control, Not moving &amp; worst of all taking Turns in the Offense… https://t.co/pB4Brkjw6SFirst really, really good possession of team defense from Miami. Heat blow up this Chicago (pindown + DHO) action by having Oladipo drop back and tag Theis, as Dedmon steps up to buy Jimmy time while he recovers onto Brown. 

Then just an absurd closeout from Oladipo https://t.co/jxtVyNuGpEJimmy Butler playing at another level in NBA playoffs for Heat

Heat in 5 but we’ll arrive there at 6 🤝One Miami Heat home game and the media starts trippin smh https://t.co/sHe8vZxRqoJimmy Butler DOMINATED last night for the Miami Heat. The Tampa Bay Lightning beat the Florida Panthers in Game 1. And the Orlando Magic took home the #1 overall pick in the 2022 NBA Draft.

@IsaacEdelman, @SaintJMac and @jfrog817 break down everything that happened last night 👇 https://t.co/l7nRDZfUVrThe Miami Heat overcame a slow start and picked their pace up in the second half to draw first blood against the Boston Celtics, 118-107, in Game 1 of the 2022 NBA Eastern Conference Playoffs finals.
