I watched KD destroy this team last year. They made adjustments, they got a Coach Gregg Pop undergrad. We need a Mark Jackson, or Sam Cassell, somebody that’s in it to win.The best we’ve ever seen @KyrieIrving as a player in his whole career, is when he was under the tutelage of @KingJames.

To all the people who blamed Philly fans please enjoy the Tinman..The year is 2027. The Brooklyn Nets are in a must win Game 7 with the expansion Nashville Fiddlers. Ben Simmons is still questionable but says he may play in Game 8.“Brooklyn can win going forward. They weren’t just going to win this year whether it was Ben Simmons or James Harden on the court. It looks bad now but I’m not going to say it’s a mistake.”

Brooklyn Nets ML (-118) 

1.18U

This is my pick of the day.@BrooklynNets Blake Griffin?If any team can come back from 3-0, it’s these Brooklyn Nets. Kyrie already conquered a 3-1 deficit and they have KD, a top 3 player in the NBA.

With that being said, they also have the ability to fold like a chair tonight and lose by 20+. Let the madness begin!@BrooklynNets It’s fucking curtains tonight.@PlayboiLeb Who cares if fans leave that’s means they weren’t really gang @BrooklynNets Steve Nash gets me tight too 💯if Kd wants him he gonna stay@BrooklynNets Just don’t get sweptI just want to see the Brooklyn Nets lose tonight just because how Durant &amp; Kyrie tried to diss 👑 when they first team up@BrooklynNets lets go!!!! comeback time@BrooklynNets @KDTrey5 @AndreDrummond do not quit, do not surrender@BrooklynNets 4-0 incomingIt wont feel right if the Nets get swept #NBAPlayoffs #BKNvsBOS #BrooklynNets it just wont https://t.co/NrJ2I2aXfN@BrooklynNets Call it a season already.

He never learnsIf Blake Griffin wants to do this, he could get off the bench of the Brooklyn Nets and join the Los Angeles Lakers. However, Blake Griffin is doing ok.

Stop with the special effects. It does NOTHING and we are still struggling for a win.

2. Why tf is Drummond starting.

3. Steve Nash needs to be fired regardless if KD is giving him a chance.

Although Brooklyn made it to the playoffs, is a 1st-round sweep a more disappointing outcome than the Lakers missing the playoffs? #superfangames@Loveeeejoy_ On the Brooklyn Nets yes lol🚨NBA PLAYOFFS🚨

Ben Simmons was the last straw. Brooklyn is broken. Boston wants it more in every way. THEY WANT THE SWEEP. I look for the Nets go down by 10 or so and then check out. Give me the defense that’s giving KD fits.

Every great team has a great coach, defense, and leadership. 🤦‍♂️@BrooklynNets @KDTrey5 @AndreDrummond Man I feel for KD. He’s had two team mates who bailed on him this season. And he’s getting all the slander.The Brooklyn Nets are prime example of why regular season matters. Seeding.

This is not a team that deserves to get bounced in the 1st round, but they didn’t take the regular season seriously. As a result, they’re facing a ECF opponent immediately instead of down the line@BrooklynNets @KDTrey5 @AndreDrummond last chance guys, goodluck!Are the Brooklyn Nets' players trying to get Steve Nash fired?

Good luck if you’re tailing folks! ☘️💰 https://t.co/dpePeeuECK@BrooklynNets @KDTrey5 @AndreDrummond I still got faith in you guysBen Simmons wears #10 for the Brooklyn Nets for all those wondering… 🤣🤣🤣The Brooklyn Nets now emphasize that they are looking to the future with Ben Simmons. Of course, that is easy to say, with the team about to be swept out of the playoffs. But it also reflects the teams suspicion that they received a flawed player in a very expensive deal.So Ben Simmons is now blaming the Brooklyn Nets organization that he needs more help mentally and physically to return to basketball…you’re kidding https://t.co/0Ni8RfJGIB@NBAonTNT @TaylorRooks @QRich @ReneeMontgomery @celtics @BrooklynNets @NBA I truly Believe that the Best Finals for 2022 would be @warriors and @celtics!!!

He had two herniated disc vs Simmons one but either way, it's crazy to be playing with the injury.Ppl ask how I’m from Brooklyn n not a NETS fan 😭😭😭 bro when they had DLO  I was fucking with dem then they brought 2 of da most mentally weak players I’ve ever seen too da teamI’m just throwing this out there. If you want to support science in every form, you want to cheer on the @celtics tonight. Since @KyrieIrving thinks the earth is flat and vaccines are bad you should cheer for the elimination of the @BrooklynNets tonight. #BleedGreen #NBAPlayoffs@NetsDaily we need to send the brooklyn nets to ukraine so they can figure this outWhenever a team is down 3-0 in a playoff series - @BrooklynNets in this case - it’s a good reminder of @R_Carpiniello quoting former Rangers coach Ted Sator when his Rangers trailed Montreal 3-0 in 1986 conference final: "One way or another, we'll be history."Brooklyn Nets just one win at least don't get swept out@CTolbertORP @ComfortStyled @stephenasmith @BrooklynNets @KDTrey5 @FirstTake No one said he can't ball. He just ain't the same John Wall anymore. The fact is, he wouldn't have produce much more wins. Period!Throw in that simp Benji and the Nets have a real mess on their hands with Kyrie Irving and Kevin Durant. James Harden is no  damn saint but even he had to get the fuck up out of Brooklyn. That should tell you all that you want to know. Harden playing with Joel Embiid is a dream.Brooklyn Nets Still Goin Win The Series And Im Takin All Bets@wojespn Looks like the @BrooklynNets got taken.

Nah, we straight. KD and Kyrie too NICE to be down 0-3 to any team &amp; THAT is the true kicker. Especially after a few years together &amp; not getting past the 2nd rd in the “east.”

Kyrie idk jus come on we ain’t gon like dat🤦🏽‍♂️They showing ‘uncle drew’ on VH1 right now I like Brooklyn nets tonight 🤞🏾😂You can't even say that LeBron James has even been this bad in the Playoffs ever.. Tatum, Brown and Smart all made Durant to look ordinary in both game 1,2 in Boston, and also game 3 in Brooklyn... 

And I don't see a way out for the Nets tonight... 

It's OverSteve nash needs to look back at the film and analyze what worked for Brooklyn. They made a huge comeback in game 1. They had a 17 point lead in game 2. There’s been times that the nets have had answers. Just go see what worked.@GoffVanGeoff I’m from Brooklyn but I don’t say I’m from Brooklyn anymore because I don’t like the Nets. 🤣😆😆@celtics @BrooklynNets @NBCSBoston @NBAonTNT @985TheSportsHub Lets go boys!!! https://t.co/hlfnGrv5H1Coach Steve Nash says he's focused on the Brooklyn Nets' reality, not where they'd be had Kyrie Irving gotten vaccinated - ESPN https://t.co/tUk8s1y5pw@SwedishNet @BrooklynNets Lmao@ParionsSport Brooklyn nets gagne de 12pts #LePlusBeauPanier https://t.co/6DryRYj0q4@TheCrossover @SIChrisMannix @HowardBeck @Herring_NBA @RohanNadkarni @robinlundberg He is not even a factor.

BK is a better team and if they were coached by Mark Jackson, Pop or Kerr, they woulda won. Nash isn’t going with what works. We were up 17 but that wasn’t good enough so he had KD playing iso ball. Then he refused to play Blake, Aldridge or Cam.Brooklyn Nets fight to stay alive vs. the Boston Celtics tonight 🏀 💥

 #Brooklyn_Nets@celtics @BrooklynNets @NBCSBoston @NBAonTNT @985TheSportsHub Let’s go celtics tototooo☘️!!!!!!!@New_Tape_City From the Nets’ fan perspective, it’s definitely not unprovoked. For years, Knicks fans have chanted the “no fans, Brooklyn will never be important, Knicks run NY” mantra. It’s culty and gate-keepy and very annoying. Look inward@BrooklynNets fly me out and I’ll take Ben’s spot!

Give me a 8 million, 3 year deal! Watch me show up for all 82 games ready to play!

I’ll average 8 points, 3 rebounds, 9 assists.

I’ll guard Lebron! I’ll guard Steph!! I’ll guard the fans storming the court! 

#NBATwitter@jreamhoops @nolimitelliot @notorioustei @BrooklynNets @HSpecialSurgery It’s not the Nets. Simmons had no intention on every playing basketball again. He was the worst trade the Nets coulda got. They need a refund.Nets’ Great Vince Carter on @BrooklynNets:

“I didn’t think it’s over tonight I think it’s going to be a gentleman’s sweep. I think @KDTrey5 going to give us one special performance. He has to, he needs to... We need that 45 plus KD from the start of the game.” 

#NetsLevel https://t.co/3IpnjB39bU2 ways the NBA media will react to Game 4:

(1) Celtics Win
“The nets just didn’t play enough together this year”

(2) Celtics Lose
“Don’t count Brooklyn out” https://t.co/Hpw12zX4uj@Queenhon23 @NBAonTNT @TurkishAirlines @celtics @BrooklynNets @utahjazz @dallasmavs well i just watched this and it didn't make me feel any better about that 😖

https://t.co/wKBojaBo13Ben Simmons is a BUM and should be cut from the @BrooklynNets.

What kind of athlete sits on the sidelines while his team is fighting to stay alive in the playoffs? @BenSimmons25The Brooklyn nets are a clown show. https://t.co/NLIbu1jbBEAre the Brooklyn Nets ready to give up against the Celtics? @FelgerAndMazz think the series ends tonight!

#NYC #NetsLevel #LGM https://t.co/VFCYJGVdYi@nba could you be any more predictable! Trying for force a game 5. Scott Foster assigned to the @celtics @BrooklynNets game tonight. @CP3 you get it right?!?!#BenSimmons Mental health is BS he got that excuse from a tennis player and gymnast and he used that to get out of #Philly . Back issues it's possible but if he didn't work on his game like his free throw and jump shot , yeah my back hurts too ! #BrooklynNets #NBA@BrooklynNets pls never change 💀 https://t.co/0HM24mgtzm@Striderglider41 @BrooklynNets @sixers @dallasmavs @ThePossessedNFT I’m interested😎@BrooklynNets @HSpecialSurgery Lets be real, there is no point of him playing if KD and Kai do not show up. I am not defending Ben, but even the Nets said that Ben has not practiced with the starters yet.Crystal Palace FC - Leeds United
Brooklyn Nets - Boston Celtics
Philadelphia 76ers - Toronto Raptors

Has he earned the right to be selfish? 🤷‍♂️ 
#Nets #Skittles https://t.co/f4F5eUo6uDNBA picks for today, the @BrooklynNets won't be swept, @sixers close out their series and the @dallasmavs take a 3-2 series lead.

Nothing new. Reported it when the KD trade went down. Jason Kidd’s @BrooklynNets we’re better than @KDTrey5 &amp; @KyrieIrving’s . 2023 be no different either, or less hilarious 😂😂 https://t.co/Dg0ehR4i6pGreat to see the NBA sending Scott Foster to Brooklyn tonight to make sure the Nets get another game. BeautifulSteve Nash got thrown into a pressure cooker in Brooklyn. If the Nets were starting from scratch, I’d say sure, keep him and see if he can grow with a young team. 

If they’re running it back with KD and Kyrie, I’m not sure I see the fit.@dusssepapii Heaa it ihhh

Make it 4-3 Nets!@fntilikinastan @Pathto18 @SeanDeveney @Lakers @BrooklynNets @nyknicks @MiamiHEAT @celtics @HeavySan High volume? He’s 54th in the league in 3s attempted bro. You understand that all these stats are readily available?Being a Barcelona fan and a Brooklyn Nets fan hasn’t been easy for the past 3yrs now 💔@TsukihimeDemake I don’t agree that this is us. I will gladly take Ben Simmons place on the Brooklyn Nets without complaint.@BrooklynNets PLEASE WIN TONIGHT@North2North Mike, I’ve lost 3x now betting on Brooklyn. Should I switch to Boston tonight or try one more time with the Nets?The @BrooklynNets experiment is failing (again)…and I’m loving it! #GoKnicks https://t.co/dPjhOXExFPTwo months after arriving in Brooklyn and with the Nets on the brink of elimination, Ben Simmons won't suit up for Game 4.

The Nets, with their massive payroll likely heading towards a first-round exit, owe Simmons $114 million through 2025.

@APOOCH gives his thoughts ⤵️Been praying on the Brooklyn Nets downfall, we just gotta wait for them to get swept tonight 🙏🏿Look Stephen A. Have sm problems with Kyrie long time ago 4 the vaccine, &amp; i believe even longer than that, but anyone trying to blame Kyrie on the @BrooklynNets failures is not smart enough, or is Just wanting to sell views for some gup, but let's not forget this is a team sport@celtics @BrooklynNets @NBCSBoston @NBAonTNT @985TheSportsHub Let’s go ahead and clean up! ☘️@BrooklynNets come on just win one gameBen Simmons of the @BrooklynNets is arguably the most pathetic, nauseating athlete, more accurately public figure at this point, that I have seen in my 20 years on earth. Absolutely disgusting how this ‘man’ has carried himself. Props to @stephenasmith for calling it as it is.@marcussmart_fc @Pathto18 @SeanDeveney @Lakers @BrooklynNets @nyknicks @MiamiHEAT @celtics @HeavySan He’s got 38% from 3 on high volume bro, a lot of pull ups too. Thay may not be elite but it is really goodY’all ready the Brooklyn Nets funeral tonightque fase vive o brooklyn nets… https://t.co/4EpDN6S8EN@MadDogRadio @MadDogUnleashed - can we start the Jay Wright - To - Brooklyn for the 22-23 season rumors now ???  He would be a perfect fit . #maddogradio #brooklynnetsThat the Brooklyn Nets got Ben Simmons out of Philly and gave him a fresh start and yet he still hasn't played a game this year is why no one should feel sorry for himReporters covering the Brooklyn Nets say that nobody on the team expected Simmons to play. So the optimistic prediction must have come from his agents. They're like (shady) used car salesmen: "The car is fine. Just don't try to start it if the temperature is under 60 or over 70."@ParionsSport Brooklyn Nets +8 points #LePlusBeauPanier https://t.co/knoPQ47o0h@girlikesgreen Brooklyn Nets get swept today@stephenasmith @BrooklynNets @KDTrey5 @FirstTake Thank you for speaking the truth and not being soft in order to make friends@NYPost_Lewis  is my only source for news on my hometown team.  

I grew up 25 miles from Brooklyn and have family there. Go #Nets! https://t.co/vT5GYN6bBK@stephenasmith @BrooklynNets @KDTrey5 @FirstTake You said almost nothing about KD gave him excuses and reasons and blamed everyone else except him. Nash's fault, Kylie fault, Ben Simmons fault. I thought u said pregame sat KD was gonna show the world who he is.Per: Woj
Kevin Durant (Brooklyn Nets) has filed for a restraining order against Celtics superstar Jayson Tatum for putting his balls on his forehead.@stephenasmith @BrooklynNets @KDTrey5 @FirstTake MJ played in an era that shooting guards didn’t really shoot very well no shooting guards are in the top 10 from MJ eraNever knew twitter watched NBA until the Brooklyn Nets started catching hands 😂😂#Sources — Steve Nash will return as head coach of the Brooklyn Nets next season regardless of outcome this year. #NBA@SteelSIoth That’s the Brooklyn Nets playoff hopes in the back@TherealHassanO @celtics @BrooklynNets @NBCSBoston @NBAonTNT @985TheSportsHub They'll lock his ass up too@stephenasmith @BrooklynNets @KDTrey5 @FirstTake Tell the truthBrooklyn #Nets Steve Nash is unlikely to be fired, per @TheSteinLineBrooklyn Nets remain as the only team in playoffs who haven't won a single game! 👀💀

They face Celtics tonight who are up 3-0 in a win-or-go-home game! Can the Nets steal their first win?

Stay tuned if we lose I’ll tell y’all the truth. But Sean marks absolutely has say in the Brooklyn nets contrary to popular beliefIf @BrooklynNets are swept today, then stop the narrative that @KDTrey5 is better than @KingJames and it was @KyrieIrving who saved bron in game 7. And stop putting the fasting factor for ky. It isn't first time someone is doing that in NBA PLAYOFFS. 
#NBAPlayoffs2022 #NBA #NBA75$1,000,000 INSURANCE GAME OF THE YEAR TONIGHT. @CELTICS @BROOKLYNNETS DOUBLE YOUR BANKROLL. https://t.co/ImZFmz2ta9@ScottyAngelBoy @mohamedmazhar_ @stephenasmith @BrooklynNets @KDTrey5 @FirstTake It’s literally facts@PaUlPoZ5 @BenSimmons25 @BrooklynNets And the problem is just as he said, he gets coddled too much! That's the problem. People keep making excuses for him. Hes making 35M a year and still has to be coddled? I'm/We're good over here. He's playing the Nets and Nash looks like a fool everytime he has to backtrack. SmhOnly those that believe Frank Vogel is responsible for the disaster that is the LA Lakers, think that Steve Nash is responsible for the drama-ridden Brooklyn Nets. https://t.co/nvtKqyeVl1@stephenasmith @BrooklynNets @KDTrey5 @FirstTake I do know that the NBA commissioner needs to fire Simmons off the league completely. Can't believe he's been benched a year a still getting paid! Waste of money atp!@sixers won the #harden #simmons trade hands down, he hasn't played a game yet, was supposed to suit up today... honestly my thinking @BrooklynNets could have gone another routeAs a lifelong Brooklyn Nets fan, I couldn’t agree more with this decision, I’m happy Steve is gonna be back! https://t.co/uh3jdeQZP5@PaUlPoZ5 @BenSimmons25 @BrooklynNets Sounds good, but he was traded in Feb. and hadnt played since June of '21. If his back was that bad, Nets should've shut him down b4 the playoffs instead of saying hes ramping up and making progress. It just sounds odd that every scheduled date keeps getting pushed.@BrooklynNets @KDTrey5 Kevin you’re gonna have to move  without the ball  you’ll have to make those extra passes.Just pass the ball around soon as it touch your hand past 2 someone else and pass back to you past to someone else back to you cut to the basket look 4 pass Mix it up.With all the shots #BenSimmons has taken from Saturday to now.

Who is doing his #PR to protect first him and second his image? (Real question, who is his PR team? bc they are slacking right now)

#sports #NBAPlayoffs2022 #NBA #BrooklynNets@GothamCityVig With Scott Foster being brought in to ref that game 4 in Brooklyn you know that Nets ML is the play.

(I’m trolling Nets fans lol)Can Brooklyn Nets win four games?🧐The #BrooklynNets are a hot mess. Not going to lie, they were my pick out of the East, and they have been so disappointing especially Durant. And Ben Simmons sitting out Game 4 now? He has been downright pathetic with his antics. #NBAPlayoffs #CelticsIn4@stephenasmith @BrooklynNets @KDTrey5 @FirstTake I’m nervous for them no lie don’t wanna see them go out like that@damilaredally Brooklyn Nets?Scott Foster in Brooklyn tonight = BET THE NETS https://t.co/8sBKH1KsnVHi Haters 👋🏿 Let’s Talk About Ben Simmons!

#BleedGreen@FDSportsbook @BrooklynNets lord have mercy on my@celtics @BrooklynNets @NBCSBoston @NBAonTNT @985TheSportsHub Bring that broom out 🧹🧹🧹What I don't understand is how the Brooklyn nets got rid of James Johnson and he was their best defender, he woulda been the 1 guarding Tatum. Benched Griffin 3 straight games, and remember nets ain't makin these moves unless KD Nd Kyrie approve.... Gas ruined em smhDont make no difference. NBA insider: The Brooklyn Nets are already sick of Ben Simmons
https://t.co/QKkMXilre5I hope the @celtics are ready for tonight. Brooklyn is going to come extra hard tonight.  We need to close this out and not let the Nets get momentum #BleedGreen@BrooklynNets you guys have to stop playing the Celtics game.KD is allow them to get into his https://t.co/m09PuDMqu6 your game and stop trying to attack the rim.Find the spots.2 pointers. Live with that and the team will win tonightI 100% wanna see the Nets get swept 😂 but Dawg it’s noooo way KD allow that right? Put my money on Brooklyn tonight??One of the high points for @BrooklynNets this year was picking up @Goran_Dragic.  A savvy vet that leaves it all on the court when his number gets called.

Let’s keep him in the roster.@Ruzster13 Ah yes I love the Brooklyn Nets, my favorite team, go Nets!@BrooklynNets @KDTrey5 @KyrieIrving @undisputed @FirstTake  my 9yr old son has a baseball game tonight … when I return home it better be 3-1 headed back to @celtics  i need 2 see more ✊🏾💯@ComfortStyled @MattMoranCA @stephenasmith @BrooklynNets @KDTrey5 @FirstTake You definitely see what's going on Crystal. I don't have a problem with him working for the owners. It's why he gets paid so much. That money comes from players' contracts. 

The only problem is that he misrepresents himself.

Then have the nerve to call Kyrie a sellout lolBrooklyn Nets ‘exasperated’ by the ongoing Ben Simmons drama https://t.co/NOjUuaSr14@TheEdyfied @NBAonTNT @TurkishAirlines @celtics @BrooklynNets @utahjazz @dallasmavs Easy bro🤣🤣🤣NBA Hall of Famer Reggie Miller didn’t hold back when he learned Ben Simmons would not play in Game 4 of the Brooklyn Nets’ first-round NBA playoffs series.

Watch the "Inside the NBA" crew discuss.
https://t.co/F6t5p3PHHR@BrooklynNets They’ve gotten to the point where Seth Curry is the one on the promo lol@ComfortStyled @stephenasmith @BrooklynNets @KDTrey5 @FirstTake That was the team deciding to sit him - not the player refusing to play@English_AS @ReggieMillerTNT @BenSimmons25 @BrooklynNets @sixers better than being stuck with Harden who clash wit Kyrie on the court.  In today's NBA with the "Scoring Pg" you have to match them with a guy like @Money23Green.  Ben Simmons fits the Nets and if that meant him chillin this year and playing next year it's worth itKD’s legacy is on the line today.

Its always been clear.  Everything happening right now is foreseeable. Has nothing to do with celtics being too good.   Nets easily should be matching the celtics if the their is a proper basketball coaching in that team.The @BrooklynNets have two historically great basketball talents on their roster in Simmons and Irving. They also have 2 historic head cases in Simmons and Irving. #NBA@AndyBurroughs @celtics @BrooklynNets @NBCSBoston @NBAonTNT @985TheSportsHub Understandable, lol that's why I wanted to make it clear, I'm not up to that.

I think he was rooting for “Brooklyn”.@BenSimmons25 really dude?????  #BrooklynNets #BenSimmons@OfficialNBARefs @celtics @BrooklynNets @NBAonTNT THE FIX IS INBen Simmons is out for Game 4 tonight in Brooklyn, adding more question marks to the long standing question of: "Will Ben Simmons ever play a game with the Nets?" https://t.co/0FMhUEWCsu@TravelMan4th @ENISUOYOR @BrooklynNets I feel your pain.Are you an NBA player? 

Do you hate your job? 

Join the Brooklyn Nets! #ad https://t.co/BuhIeYIUGq@ENISUOYOR @BrooklynNets Harden was no doubt a problem though. I'm glad the NETS are rid of him. It's just sad that Simmons is proving not to be a solution either.

I would not let him off the hook for the entire game... if he shows up at all.If the argument is that NBA refs are conspiring to help the Pelicans and extend this series (which is hilarious to say out loud). Then my question would be why are the media darling Brooklyn Nets about to get swept?It ain’t over till it’s OVER🤷🏽‍♀️ #NETSLEVEL @BrooklynNets@madler9000 @celtics @BrooklynNets @NBA Are they ringing them up when they get off the bus?@Bluvny @stephenasmith @BrooklynNets @KDTrey5 @FirstTake @espn @maxkellerman Max looks like more of those jersey guys on tv than a black guy.@sheridialc @stephenasmith @BrooklynNets @KDTrey5 @FirstTake I think that the fact that it was even brought up itself. I knew myself that if he didn't play before the playoff, he wasn't going to play at all.

For example: Paul George came back with about a week or so left to "get ready" for the playoffs. Ben is trying to jump into Game 4Ben Simmons would've been playing with house money. If the @BrooklynNets lose tonight and he played, it probably wouldn't fall on him. He just made it worse. EVERY NBA PLAYER IS SORE IN THE PLAYOFFS! WELCOME TO PRO SPORTS! Life is full of challenges, face them, don't run.Will the Nets avoid the sweep? 🧹

I think the Celtics will sweep the Nets. The Nets gave me no reason to pick them. Brooklyn has failed to cover the number in 28 of it’s last 34 games at home. Final score prediction, Celtics win 115-111. #marchmadness #sportsbetting #sportsbettingadvice https://t.co/7rw7pS9qacBefore series started would it have been Nets -1 at home? I'm betting on Brooklyn ml @1.88 tonight. There's overwhelming negativity surrounding the Nets now. I think that public perception makes for a better price to bet. All the fans blaming Steve Nash, KD, and Kyrie.Some people just hate their job..

The Brooklyn Nets are the prime example of why strictly analytics don’t work. Kyrie blew up every team he’s been on, Ben Simmons hates basketball. Numbers on a sheet don’t tell u that people ain’t good fits4/25/22

Final chance Nets. Let’s see if Durant shows up tonight or if he continues to be Tatums bitch. 

🔒POTD: Brooklyn Nets (-115)

Good Luck!

Simmons play basketball then Ben Simmons!@TeezLitmore He fly as hell, no doubt. But I’m not tuning in to see this niggas outfits. Only outfit I wanna see him in his Brooklyn Nets Uniform cuz he get paid to hoop.

He’s also a great vet presence. But yea, if he would be ok playing ~20 mins a game I don’t see an issue@BrooklynNets @HSpecialSurgery I think they should kick Ben Simmons out of the NBA because they are a lot of players who are getting paid for free and this just needs to stop@BrooklynNets need to get this dub today or I switch to @memgrizz@jreamhoops @alex93899882 @BrooklynNets @HSpecialSurgery Nothing to lose then@stephenasmith says on national TV that Ben Simmons is the “weakest most pathetic excuse for a professional athlete we have ever seen”.

No reason you should care that much unless you bet on a game or you are a fan of the Nets.Some @BrooklynNets fans:

*Simmons is an asset and we could possibly trade him*

A) Not an asset until he can play, be effective and stay healthy
B) He's currently the definition of damaged goods, you are not getting any kind of value for Simmons in a deal
#NetsWorld #NetsLevelThe Brooklyn Nets are the best example of what your basketball culture can turn to if you let the players make the decisions and let them dictate your franchise and organization.

He shouldn't be paid a fu#king cent. #BenSimmons #Pathetic #NBA @BrooklynNets @NBA @NBAonTNT #KevinDurant@umhowboutnot @BrooklynNets How did Philly lose?I am loving this Brooklyn Nets talk by both Skip and Stephen A 🤣🤣@BrooklynNets Step up or go home.And not one damn tear been shed for the Celtics riiiiiight?

Bet-ID: B9RJ349501526Y2-3061493@JClarkNBCS After the sixers game when he didn’t return i felt like he was never going to play a game with the nets and they’d trade him in the offseason. I believe he doesn’t want to be in Brooklyn either and wants to be in California or west coast.Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving are struggling against Boston, and Ben Simmons won’t be available to help them Monday with the Brooklyn Nets’ season on the brink. His former teammate, Joel Embiid, plans to play on through injury.  https://t.co/FyJ1AjyXRnIf you know Basketball then you know there are no quick fixes! Ask Klay Thompson. Jayson Tatum is making his mark and has a supporting cast.

We all know that coming back to help tie it at 2-2 is way different than showing up already down 0-3.

LBJ is a better athlete than MJ, but MJ was a better Player/leader/finisher. Brady was not even close to the best athlete on the field but he is a killer/winner. @BrooklynNets have a team of gifted athletes but did not measure their ❤️

It’s not so much of Nets issues as it is that Nets are playing against a well coached Celtics team who are playing lights out basketball. Nets have done a good job considering their issues/injuries@BrooklynNets @HSpecialSurgery Ben SimmonsHere’s the reality with the @BrooklynNets Kyrie didn’t play most the season so his body lacks full conditioning for playoff-level performance. KD is still injured. So it makes sense that they are inconsistent. #NBAPlayoffsAfter a disappointing start to the 2022 postseason. The Brooklyn Nets have lost 3 straight games. 

The most skilled duo (Kevin Durant- Kyrie Irving) of All-Time are on the verge of getting swept. #BKNvsBOS https://t.co/oQnsnGmQS4@stephenasmith @BrooklynNets @KDTrey5 @FirstTake @RealMikeWilbon picked the Celtics to win.

Julius Randle is also the best forward in New York sadly. 💯I’m averaging the same amount of points, rebounds, and assist as Ben Simmons.

Still bizarre that completely moribund @BrooklynNets are seen as a better bet to win their series than the Raptors.

Stop baiting.The @celtics are showing the @BrooklynNets and the rest of the NBA that you can't cheat the process. Regular season games matter. Missing so many games and thinking talent alone will be good enough to beat actually team basketball is just not happening. #NBA #NBAPlayoffs2022@stephenasmith @BrooklynNets @KDTrey5 @FirstTake Can't not wait🗣️ Reggie Miller blasted Ben Simmons for his lack of competitiveness after getting ruled out for Nets' win-or-go-home Game 4. 👀

What are you up to Ben? 🙄

#bensimmons #reggiemiller #brooklynnets https://t.co/cjtTgcmybq@balldontstop @BrooklynNets @KDTrey5 It's just a very bad time for KD to suddenly have an uncharacteristic time on the court. I think we can all agree on that. He's not doing it on purpose obviously. Nash should just switch it up now and go for broke, Leave Brown and Griffin on the floor most of the game.Yo @BrooklynNets I’ll take Ben Simmons roster spot off your hands 👀@stephenasmith @BrooklynNets @KDTrey5 @FirstTake Ben Simmons is the WORST teammate in sports history.

Kd injury and Harden trade doom the nets.@balldontstop It's not disrespect. @BrooklynNets fans are shocked to see him shut down by the Celtics, and when he has shot opportunities he's not sinking baskets that he has made with ease throughout the season. He's not choking.

Brooklyn Nets rule Ben Simmons out for Game 4; All-Star forward reported back soreness, sources say - via @ESPN App https://t.co/LOWSbhqDA7@Louie17mx @BrooklynNets @CanonUSA Kyrie does not care right now. And really why should he?Bruh KD and Kyrie are nowhere compared to Bron and Wade

We cannot let KD failing Slide, coz if it was LeBron, he would have got killed by media.

Not everyone can be a leader, they both should have stayed with Bron and Curry.

For months, our @NickFriedell has been in pressers asking the Nets and their superstars tough, uncomfortable questions.

The more excuses Ben makes to not play the more reluctant teams will be to give him money to continue his career in the NBA.@GPHatesThisApp @Aneerinyourear Ok and I'm from Brooklyn and you would think it would a sea of Nets fans out here but nope it's still definitely a Knick townI can only imagine what Brooklyn Nets fans going thru right now.@ReggieMillerTNT If you're a nets fan, do you even want him to play? We all know he's a liability in the playoffs and Boston owns him. Brooklyn is having a tough enough time now, how do you think they'll make out when it's 5 vs 4 the whole game?@stephenasmith @BrooklynNets yall need to fire @SteveNash . Y’all fired the former coach, coincidentally he’s black, before y’all even gave him a chance to work with the superstars y’all got to join the team. Now be fair and get rid of Nash. Not commanding enough for the ego’s.Is Kyrie Irving the one to blame for the @BrooklynNets disappointing season? @MitchMossRadio and @paulyhoward think so. Who would you point the finger at? Weigh in below! #FollowTheMoney https://t.co/EQoGhVeQTMI thought the Brooklyn Nets were gonna play above the rim and just alley oop every play with that roster. But nope, they choking and need help.@BrooklynNets @KDTrey5 you guys have been hosed by a bum. It's said that @BenSimmons25 has just quit on the game of basketball and that's a shame. He's very talented but he is a fraud. It's prob coming from @KingJames @RichPaul4 @KlutchSports. I call bullsh*t on his this.@BrooklynNets Don't give up on KD and Kyrie but that Ben Simmons he is too soft you messed up trading for him. Tell him to go work a 9 to 5 job and see how your back feels. Pisses me off I have bad back and neck and I still have to go to work! Like I said soft.Good morning

They knew he was a drama queen and still decided to trade for him. He isn’t a team player and never will be. #NBA #Brooklyn #NetsLevelShould NBA suspend/ban Ben Simmons for his actions in the past year

@sixers @BrooklynNets@wojespn @BrooklynNets thought they traded for a guy who wanted to play, but #BenSimmons doesn’t want to ball anymoreI’m super curious to see how Brooklyn nets fans are feeling about Ben Simmons now that he’s sitting out game 4. Still think you got the best of that trade ? Enjoy watching the playoffs after this week ☺️@WorldWideWob Hes in Brooklyn reffing the Nets gameThe thing on here right now is to clown Ben Simmons for not playing. Look, we can’t mess around with mental health awareness. Bottom line is he ain’t ready to play. And this is more on the Brooklyn #Nets for their lack of awareness. 

#NetsLevel #NBAPlayoffsI challenge YOU, Brooklyn Nets, to not get swept in the first round https://t.co/vq295RUxH6Earlier this season I was a guest on @TheDimeNBA with @Josh_Rodriguez_ (shoot him a follow and check out the pod!) and I compared the Brooklyn Nets to a Coney Island Hot Dog.

What a shite series... the Celtics have been beastly.. much improved on last year... Brooklyn took a huge step in the wrong direction.

#Netsworld Ben Simmons for Zion Williamson, &amp; Jose Alvarado!READY TO GET SWEPT @BrooklynNets ?@MUSICANDBUILDS That's true, Brooklyn Nets have 2 guys that create their own shots and they're up are 3-0 against the good Celtics D.

Kyrie and KD are just having their way against the Celtics D. Brooklyn is going sweep the Celtics in the next game.Ben Simmons is now targeting game 7 or 8 for his season debut for the @BrooklynNets@BrooklynNets I’ll play! Fuck Ben SimmonsBen Simmons won’t play because the Brooklyn Nets have given upNBA PLAYOFFS (RECORD: 12-13)

10* BOSTON CELTICS (+1) over Brooklyn Nets

9* PHILADELPHIA 76ERS (-7.5) over Toronto Raptors

8* DALLAS MAVERICKS (-3) over Utah JazzWhat’s Ben Simmons Twitter account? I couldn’t get ahold on this clown.
Man! This guy doesn’t wanna be a part of the embarrassment KD Kyrie and the @BrooklynNets are facing.
Reggie Miller, Charles Barkley and Shaq are right on the money..just try to help your team Ben Simmons!🖕The Brooklyn Nets play today. https://t.co/8Dp2nrzlNT@RealJayWilliams The Brooklyn Nets have 0 leadership, KD doesn't want to lead, he just wants to hoop. Kyrie is incapable of leading, the Celtics situation showed that. Steve Nash doesn't know what a leader is from the head coach position, probably because he doesn't know how to be a headcoach yetBen Simmons of the @NBA was a 1st overall pick? He’s missed two complete seasons and played in parts of two more. He’s never averaged more than 16.9 pts a game. I’d say he is an absolute draft bust. The @BrooklynNets won’t even be able to trade him. Still owed $112 million too https://t.co/zY2SU01jDb@NBA @celtics @BrooklynNets, please win the next game. 🙏@MarkGre84321817 @BrooklynNets Boston has an actual COACH!!Y’all can’t win ONE game bro? @BrooklynNets@bingopoptwo @yourmaineguy1 @xx_mtok @BrooklynNets The issue is the Nets don’t have a COACH!!

Ben Simmons ruled out for a must win game for the Nets. 

The Celtics are currently up 3-0 in the series and with big expectations on B.Simmons making a return for the Nets it could be a early exit for the Nets.

#baskettips #basketprediction #basketballbets #nba #usabasketIn order for the Brooklyn Nets not to get swept Kevin Durant Need at least 60 points &amp; Kyrie Irving Need at least 40 &amp; they need to put Blake Griffin in the starting line up I don’t see that happening though so Boston Celtics in 4.The Brooklyn Nets then completed a 17-point comeback against the Milwaukee Bucks in Game 5 behind a herculean performance from Kevin Durant.Basketball playoffs are going off!!! If @BrooklynNets get swept life will be sad in New York #Playoffs #basketball #nets #CelticsThe @BrooklynNets had good culture, before KD and Kyrie arrived. The team was a happy team composed of up and coming players and a ton of trade assets.𝐇𝐎𝐉𝐄 𝐓𝐄𝐌 𝐂𝐄𝐋𝐓𝐈𝐂𝐒 ☘️

It looks like they're steadily hiding something.@warriorsworld He’s mad, Kyrie found that loop hole 🕳 and exposed the @NBA and @BrooklynNets for that 💰 bag ( hater award 🥇 goes to Stephen A Smith for dick riding Kyrie Irving ) Skip Bayless 🥈for dick riding LeBron James

#wasteoftimeThis is basketball? Crazy how the @Suns and the @BrooklynNets have to play against the players and the referees.

So what that the Nets who u picked will be swept, is ok that Ben can’t try &amp; contribute, but u would ratherImma need y’all to at least win Game 4. Is that too much to ask my brothers? @BrooklynNets@ItsNotAdamAtAll Nets have affordable tickets because there are no actual nets fans in New York. Brooklyn is a super expensive area, and if the nets had fans, best believe tickets would be expensive. Look how many Celtics fans were at the last gameIs Brooklyn Nets get swept, I’m gonna have to make some major changes in my life #BrooklynnetsVsBontonCelticsBrooklyn Nets in 7 💯💯‼️The @BrooklynNets holding back Ben Simmons to not play that could be Nets last post season game. This is very intriguing and mysterious on why oh why Ben Simmons can’t really play. It’s probably not the back issue, it’s more of a mental grind that Ben just couldn’t tough it up.@BrooklynNets pls win tmr. I like the lakers, but make it a series.@Kaloorup_pikie @BrooklynNets FlogAre ppl still saying the @BrooklynNets won that Ben Simmons James Harden trade?This is the moment I knew this guy was a fraud!

Joke.@Dana_TFSJ @MikeSielski @BrooklynNets He didn’t want to play gm 3 because if they lost, he’d be blamed.

Real talk. #Nets #BrooklynNets@HaroldPerrineau Is that the #BrooklynNets on the bus?Brooklyn Nets star forward Kevin Durant admitted Saturday night that he has been "thinking too much" throughout the first-round series against the Boston Celtics and that it has been a factor in his poor play.

But he also chose to leave three of the smartest, most sensible and dedicated superstars in the League. Most superstars aren't playing in ideal situations.

He chose a bad running mate teaming with Kyrie. Kyrie is selfish and all about Kyrie. He pushed for Harden when they had great role players in Allen and Levert.

And we are about to be sweep !!!! F… Nash !!!@BrooklynNets It seems like Nash doesn't know the players he has on the bench.

I agree with Cookie, Knick fans rooting for Brooklyn cannot be trusted.  What's a Net, a piece of apparatus?  Knick fans die hard, since 1990 .412 winning percentage and all the screwy trades and contracts!
