The @Bucks knew this before adding him to their roster.  Now the question for the #Bucks is do they continue to support this type of dirty player, who clearly didn‚Äôt regret his actions after the flagrant foul.

https://t.co/oWNYTKYjmS https://t.co/04EGKbYeHvMilwaukee will always play second fiddle to Chicago. Thats why Bucks fans are defending Grayson Allen. Pure jealousy of something they‚Äôll never be.@btorr16 @BPortistime @Bucks No he lives in Barcelona@tazman112177 @chicagobulls @Bucks If you look at the replay, you'll see that he pulls down Caruso with his left hand and then helps with his right. That's the issue: if he had just tried to swat the ball, and missed  - no foul, but after missing the ball he pulls Caruso down hence clear flagrant.@psychehalo @jakemah8 @IKE_Bucks @GraysonJAllen @Bucks Also this whole point is mute because the post has more to do with optics than semantics@BullsStampede @DOM_Frederic @Bucks If you‚Äôre referring to the team, sure. But nobody on the planet that hasn‚Äôt attended duke university has ever liked Allen@itsmine49 @Bucks ALL of GB looks like this and WI lol expect Milwaukee lolThe @Bucks are a good organization. They owe it to their fans and the other teams to have Grayson Allen step aside until he is capable of conducting himself in a manner that lives up to their values.

He should be out of league with multiple incidents like this. He showed no remorse and his teammates had his back??? How is that even right!?!?  @NBA should suspend him as long as our guy @ACFresh21 is out!!!@chicagobulls @ACFresh21 back for one game, and now requires surgery because of that piece of shit @GraysonJAllen.

Suspend that disgusting excuse of an @NBA player.

The only thing I‚Äôd say is that Allen has a history of being dirty &amp; history tends to repeat itself.

Just saying.@Pattyca26892879 @statmuse @Bucks @Giannis_An34 @Jrue_Holiday11 @Khris22m How does this have 21 likes? lol

That team was starting Bledsoe, who got traded the following offseason for Jrue Holiday, who literally his first year in Milwaukee, helped lead them to a title.

This is now year 2. Bucks have known nothing but titles with this big 3.@MaxsAllStars @Bucks To be fair‚Ä¶I invited a good friend up from IL to enjoy the rivalry, she rocked Bulls colors but wasn‚Äôt obnoxious about it. And I got to gloat after lol@jacob_rut @statmuse @Bucks @Giannis_An34 @Khris22m @Jrue_Holiday11 No Brook Lopez and Jrue Holiday is on a severe minutes restriction to the point he's not even in the starting lineup.

#Milwaukee #Bucks #Chicago #Bulls #CHIvsMIL https://t.co/6ds3jiIB8ZWhat a surprise!! Turned on @kayosports to watch @WashWizards vs @Raptors. They‚Äôre playing @chicagobulls/@Bucks game instead. #nbaHaven't seen many low-scoring 1st quarters lately. #Bulls trail at Milwaukee 24-20 after one. Bulls are 2-11 from 3-pt range, Bucks are 2-12. Giannis leads all scorers with 10 ptsBulls are 2-11 from 3. Bucks are cold too at 2-12.

But difference is Bucks have 14 points in paint and Bulls have 2. Milwaukee does such a good job of sealing off lane and limiting dribble drives.@Bucks It is important for Bucks.
Let‚Äôs go Bucks!@kwright315 @Bucks Fresh@Bucks Can we start making shots?@bigboy1701_ @Bucks Hope bulls beat them for this bs@Bucks HE HIT ONE!!!there are more Chicago fans than Milwaukee fans I feel #Bucks #FearTheDeer
