@NBA @celtics @adriandhowell better be watching 🙌🏼☘️🍀🏆1️⃣7️⃣#NBA basketball today at 230p: my Dallas Mavericks play against the Boston Celtics. I'm expecting Luka to lead us to another victory, hooray! #mfflNobody scares me more than when the @celtics is playing against KD and Steph in that order. That’s how good they are in my opinion they can literally instill fear all by themselves. I hope Tatum has that effect too for other teams. I think so. #celticstalkFUCK !

#NBA https://t.co/ZUxEUxcCse@NBA_de @celtics TheisI'd also like to point out that YESTERDAY was the 50th anniversary of the Boston Celtics retiring Bill Russell's number. Bill wasn't big on ceremony back then...I remember vividly Kevin Garnett's 1st exhibition game in a Boston Celtics uniform in Italy. The first play, KG went baseline &amp; did an up &amp; under jam. IT WAS ON. KG was like The Admiral mixed w/ DMX. #BleedGreen @Dart_Adams @HonestLarry1 @frostybias @CausewayStreet @CelticsGRD https://t.co/JbaQvEIrdeGreatest What If (Injury Edition) https://t.co/3egre0F9w7 #celticsstrong #nba #bostonceltics@cedricmaxwell81 @James_Posey41 @HonestLarry1 @CelticsCLNS @CLNS_Nick @BGlobeSports @celtics @paulpierce34 @KevinGarnett5KG @NBCSCeltics @985TheSportsHub Wish he was a celtic earlier in his career!!!

One of favorite players. https://t.co/CwNCM7zYrJHad the privilege of seeing KG play in person many times. By far the best defensive player of my lifetime IMO.

I’m telling you the biggest difference is the Heat thing hahaKevin Garnett's 5 will be the 23rd number retired by the Boston Celtics (Jim Loscutoff's #18 was retired for Dave Cowens since he requested his number stay available so his nickname was retired instead). If you were to join the Celtics, you'd have few numbers available as options@StevenGuajardo @Sportsfeeder1 @NBA @celtics Right, I remember him going there after the Celtics, just couldn’t remember if there was more to it then just that.
