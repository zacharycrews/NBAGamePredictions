BRUHHHHH@30from3o @TheHoopCentral @warriors yeah bro a twitter account with 400 followers liking tweets from other accounts with 400 followers is the exact same thing as the entire national media circuit being not only completely silent 9/10 times steph plays poorly but continuing to post what few highlights he has@warriors You lost?@warriors This look photoshopped@nick_muturi_ @warriors He is coming back  

Intact in less than 15 days. 

But even without him, we remain solid. 

I don't know whether the same can be said for you. LOL@TheHoopCentral @warriors Who runs this page???@30from3o @TheHoopCentral @warriors like i actually dont even see how this one is unreasonable, HC has posted more about a 7/28 L than the team that actually won the game. this is exactly the shit i was talking bout when i said everyone ignores his bad games the last time you were on my page. goodnight@xNeThePrince @NBAFan23302408 @TheHoopCentral @warriors he’s injured?@30from3o @TheHoopCentral @warriors then unfollow me@LamesLarden @TheHoopCentral @warriors beal isn’t even in conversation to be an all star rn much less the MVP@TooMightySZN @Freddd2k @TheHoopCentral @warriors That’s because nobody will ever care about the Spurs, even when y’all had Tim Duncan and co.

It just comes with being great@warriors Best believe...@goatedwok @lysergicpsych @TheHoopCentral @warriors The media gotta be the worst thing ever created.

It was so ugly@TheHoopCentral @warriors Spurs won this game you buffoons@goatedwok @lysergicpsych @TheHoopCentral @warriors Those are mainly twitter trolls and ngl i wasn’t on nba Twitter like that until late last season@lysergicpsych @SGAismysavior @TheHoopCentral @warriors Right all I see is “KD helped him” “he can’t carry a team” “0 FMVP” like bro get slandered crazy 🤣🤣@warriors Didn’t he shoot 7/28? 🤣@SGAismysavior @lysergicpsych @TheHoopCentral @warriors Idk about he doesn’t get slandered the like everyone. Every comment section is “curry has 0 FMVP fraud” “he isn’t clutch” and pretty much go slandered like crazy for these last few bad games he’s had. I mean you should’ve seen twitter in the first part of last season. It was ugly@RonBohning He said the same thing when he was with @warriors ………@lysergicpsych @TheHoopCentral @warriors I didn’t say that he isn’t, but notice how these twitter and ig pages love to post when players are having a bad 3 or 5 game stretch, but no one posted the warriors loss to the Spurs or his statline from the last 3 games@TheHoopCentral @warriors He shot 7/28@TheHoopCentral @warriors Scoreboard buddy we lost and he was ass@TheHoopCentral @warriors Only Dejounte who really contested that and GSW lost.@goatedwok @lysergicpsych @TheHoopCentral @warriors I agree with that, but he’s not the only player that dont get calls. Russ and pg dont get calls either. They’re not on stephs level but eventually you gotta play through it. I’m talkin about the media tho.

#sports@warriors Scoreboard?Time to realize what the golden state warriors did the last two years: TANKED, got the number two pick in 2020 and had TWO top fourteen picks in the 2021 draft. Those turned into James Wiseman, Jonathan Kuminga and Moses Moody - all have great potential.
