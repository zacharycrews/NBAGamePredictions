Drummond is a backup who can’t defend pick and rolls. Curry is streaky with no defense. Simmons can allegedly play at a high level but we know his shortcomings.  Don’t be delusionalThe Celtics are the best defense in the league without a doubt. I’m calling it right here, right now. The Boston Celtics are the 2021/2022 NBA Champions. 🤫🤫🤫🤫🤫🤫@mulosoraptor23 @TherealHassanO @sightedmike @NBAonTNT @celtics I don’t care about Joel’s post season with Brett Brown. If you think he’s the same player today that he was then, sadly you don’t know ball@MikoWitYaMoney @TherealHassanO @sightedmike @NBAonTNT @celtics Because harden is a rental and drummond curry and Simmons can all play at a high level...duh@travelguruzz @mulosoraptor23 @TherealHassanO @sightedmike @NBAonTNT @celtics Right… to a team who’s on a 9 game win streak and is *checks notes* looking up at us in the standings for the 2nd year in a row@MikoWitYaMoney @TherealHassanO @sightedmike @NBAonTNT @celtics Joel was on those teams who are 1-8 against Boston in the postseason. Teams who were arguably deeper than this one...lol@mulosoraptor23 @TherealHassanO @sightedmike @NBAonTNT @celtics We got an an all star player (Joel’s most talented teammate in his career) for 2 fake firsts, a backup center and a streaky shooter who you can’t play in the playoffs. How is that a fleecing? Lmao@mulosoraptor23 @TherealHassanO @sightedmike @NBAonTNT @celtics Bro no one is worried about tonight. Joels worst game of the year after dominating Boston the previous 3 times this year.Well that went well 👇🏻🤩😎😂💚 #BleedGreen @celtics https://t.co/TP8tOsJ8hCWhat A performance by @Giannis_An34 50 points from 21 shot attempts, the fourth fewest in NBA history. Also, a blowout win for the @celtics over the @sixers plus the @Suns strengthening their hold atop the west.@MikoWitYaMoney @TherealHassanO @sightedmike @NBAonTNT @celtics Even with harden you still lose tonight buddy.

They’re consistently making the right play and  extra pass more often than not.

#LetsGoCsThis first half proves what I’ve thought all season.

This team is currently one of the hottest in the league.
