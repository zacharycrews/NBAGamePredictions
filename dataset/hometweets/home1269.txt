He shot 49.8% during the regular season, but has hit on just 31% of his shots so far in the series against the Utah Jazz.

Happened Back in 2007 when the 8th Seeded Golden State Warriors beat the heavily favored 1 Seeded Dallas Mavericks. 4 Games to 2. and Whats Even Crazier Is that the mavericks went to the Finals that Last@theallterrain @FrankLikina @dallasmavs Understandable! Game 5. We got this! 💪🏾💪🏾@Crimsix @DallasStars Would you go to a Dallas mavericks game?Hey @garystriewski fuck the talk @dallasmavs https://t.co/IMB2UnAeel@esidery He just said how it is. Suns lost by 15 on a 15 to 40 FTA.

Dallas Mavericks lost by 1 point on a 23 to 42 FTA attempt and a freaking NonCall in the last 33 seconds. Tell us @NBAOfficial that this is not on your Referees. 

😐Reminder: All year long, the Suns have been compared to that 2014 San Antonio Spurs team that lost in the Finals the year before, ripped through the league and then won the title.

That Spurs team got taken to 7 games in the first round by the 8-seeded Dallas Mavericks.@townbrad Dallas Mavericks are a class act. From game commentators to the coaching staff and players.I have the best Dallas Mavericks-inspired basketballs shorts ever.
