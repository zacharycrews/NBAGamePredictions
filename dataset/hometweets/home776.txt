Can you contain Atlanta Hawks Trae Young limit the lob dunks by Atlanta ?Defense takes heart and determination. Lakers previous rosters had those type defenders. Monk, Ellington, &amp; Carmelo a downgrade.Kicking off the road trip in Atlanta

Is that your second start you are comparing him to All NBA/ All Star/ Champion Pascal Siakam. 

And ya’ll paid him 125M 😂@Reese929IndAtl @ATLHawks I totally agree. If we limit their offensive engine, we could finish this game as winners.@ATL_The_MVP @ATLHawks Lol.

He will get annoyed get tech foul and be on needles all game.

He runs the engine. I hope Nate puts Hunter on CP3.  Devin gonna eat anyway... This would be the move to disrupt their O.
