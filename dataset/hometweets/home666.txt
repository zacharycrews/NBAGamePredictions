The Dallas Mavericks have a top-five defense in the NBA, just as we all expect-

Hold on, I am receiving word that we, and I quote, “did not expect this at all.” 

How are they doing this?

When Luka returned he bought into the culture shift &amp; as a result they are a better team.@ItsMeHenning I’ll never forget the day where the Twitter account for my beloved Dallas Mavericks found a way to combine two of my greatest obsessions from the past decade: Talking Heads and Mavs phenom, Luka Doncic (whose jersey number is 77). https://t.co/THIPMyYmHt@NBAHistory @dallasmavs Top 3 PF all timeThe Dallas Mavericks list both Reggie Bullock (right knee soreness) and Maxi Kleber (left knee soreness) as QUESTIONABLE for tonight's game against the Toronto Raptors.I’ll pack Porzingis bags myself @dallasmavs https://t.co/A4bnIfpWsuMavericks play Raptors tonight before facing Suns tomorrow in Dallas.

Tail or Fade LFG❤️ https://t.co/tiwJGS7R8NLooking at my Facebook memories and I saw 7 years ago today I shared a post of the Dallas Mavericks beating the Grizzlies 103 to 95. In the picture is Monta Ellis and behind him is the one and only DWIGHT POWELL. 7 years, man. 7. YEARS. The Mavs really love this dude huhLove this clip of the @dallasmavs defense. Great communication, rotation, and shell principles to force an inefficient shot. Blitz to get ball out of Shai's hands and full rotate out. Love Powell rotating down instead of to Giddey on the weakside. Great activity by Luka as well https://t.co/k3K97ccLhADallas Mavericks: Gameday: Raptors @ Mavericks, Jan. 19 https://t.co/c8S9CqE7MDTORONTO RAPTORS vs
