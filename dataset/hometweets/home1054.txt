But other than a few good games. He’s been a mid scorer while clearly looking slower than he used to be. Get a clue dude😂@DonDavious @30reacts @nbaoficialtrash @sjseric @Suns Na. Draymond balances the shots because he'll take fewer than his replacements (Porter/Kuminga).

Most of the recent championship experience is all on the Warriors. Bucks are still relavant but the Raptors practically broke up. Warriors in 4.3/18/05 – The Phoenix #Suns lost 110-100 to GSW, but at halftime, the late Cotton Fitzsimmons was inducted into the Ring of Honor. Cotton was a 3x Suns Head Coach (341-208), 1988-89 Coach of the Year, and long-time Exec. &amp; broadcaster.

With CP3 out, and The @Suns still want rolling as the #1 team in the league is deserving enough. For him to come out and have to play make, and be a bucket is promising for the franchise. https://t.co/JifJPlzQuV@DonDavious @30reacts @nbaoficialtrash @sjseric @Suns I do watch the games. And the Warriors have the 3rd best defense with hurt players. There's nothing to make up lol. Last I checked (Before the BOS game) Warriors we're 3rd in defensive rating. Healthy Warriors sweeps whatever the Suns have.@wtf_rudy @30reacts @nbaoficialtrash @sjseric @Suns You are such a sheep😂 again, CP3 is just being safe. It’s nothing more than a finger injury.@30reacts @wtf_rudy @nbaoficialtrash @sjseric @Suns Dray can’t guard our 2 other great centers tho🤷‍♂️@wtf_rudy @30reacts @nbaoficialtrash @sjseric @Suns No, those 2 teams just knew how to play through adversity. Don’t twist it. No one is healthy in the playoffs.@wtf_rudy @30reacts @nbaoficialtrash @sjseric @Suns Nobody on the suns is a me first player . Not a single one😭😭 GS has shown nothing to be considered a championship team. Other than they have Steph and Dray.@kirkgoldsberry @celtics @Suns @Timberwolves @memgrizz @utahjazz @nuggets @Lakers @Bucks @MiamiHEAT @BrooklynNets Interesting how the Sixers are so average with the year Embiid is having. Why can’t the Bucks play defense? Love the Heat so much, they just build it the right way. Same with Boston. Defense. And last, all eyes on the Nets every game bc Durant and Kyrie together is holy grail.@Suns @FootprintCNTR @CarMax @chicagobulls @BALLYSPORTSAZ @AZSports @az_mejor Is @BALLYSPORTSAZ going to cause a blackout of the @NBATV broadcast ?!@DonDavious @30reacts @nbaoficialtrash @sjseric @Suns Hand injury; the entire hand. He had it wrapped and the All-star game. #1 is for sure a help, they'll need it. A team of role players led by Booker sounds good out of respect for Booker, but brooms are brooms. That 8-pt loss wasn't enough.@30reacts @DonDavious @nbaoficialtrash @sjseric @Suns Playoffs different than the regular season. Bucks know that too; they've been coasting. They're way better than their record. They're the only team with enough to push a healthy Warriors.@DonDavious @30reacts @nbaoficialtrash @sjseric @Suns Loon. Underrated but he has 2 rings and got alot of playoff minutes. He got hurt vs. TOR too. Warriors can put out a championship 5 out there, not too many teams can say that.'He's not even tired': Suns wing Mikal Bridges leading NBA in total minutes #Phoenix #Suns #NBA https://t.co/0GAjqUgd8zRobert Sarver has a long history of abusive, racist, and misogynistic behavior.
 
It’s time for the @NBA to remove Mr. Sarver from ownership of the Phoenix @Suns.

Comes with the 8 rings@DonDavious @30reacts @nbaoficialtrash @sjseric @Suns '14 SA is wishful thinking. Their core was practically done winning All their individual awards; the young guy won FMVP. No matter what they do a GS will likely sweep them

GS only hole is the role players have no Playoff experience; Wigs included. Suns don't have 2 Bridges and CP will have 1 hand. Tryna warn you.

We are just playing it safe. We basically have the #1 seed locked up anyways.@30reacts @wtf_rudy @nbaoficialtrash @sjseric @Suns Steph, Klay, dray, and iggyz. Who else?@30reacts @wtf_rudy @nbaoficialtrash @sjseric @Suns Lmao, looked at the score and not the game. So hypocritical😭😭@DonDavious @30reacts @nbaoficialtrash @sjseric @Suns I could be wrong but I think it his shooting hand; huge problem for anyone. They'll froze in the Playoffs; especially on the road. PHX just making the WCF would be a successful season - respectfully.@30reacts @wtf_rudy @nbaoficialtrash @sjseric @Suns Keep that production up in the playoffs and we win in 5😂😂@30reacts @wtf_rudy @nbaoficialtrash @sjseric @Suns The warriors are cocky and they fold when they aren’t fully healthy. Guess what, no teams are fully healthy at the end of the season. Learn to play through it like the suns have😂@30reacts @DonDavious @nbaoficialtrash @sjseric @Suns Dallas underrated too. Both might have to play PHX after PHX sees a young MIN or a 40ppg 1st Round LeBron - Clips might sneak it through.@30reacts @wtf_rudy @nbaoficialtrash @sjseric @Suns Sure buddy😂😂@wtf_rudy @30reacts @nbaoficialtrash @sjseric @Suns Suns are built for the playoffs. They got more playoff experience while being even more hungry. Reminds me of the 2014 spurs who lost the previous year and cam back hungrier than before.@30reacts @wtf_rudy @nbaoficialtrash @sjseric @Suns We 30 balled them, and barley lost to them with half our team and the refs were against us. Watch the game you tool😂@DonDavious @30reacts @nbaoficialtrash @sjseric @Suns Don't trust them in playoff ball. Teams are better than the West teams from last year. Draymond has also beating way better bigs than Ayton. Both teams are deep. The Warriors are Top heavy and deep.@kirkgoldsberry @celtics @Suns @Timberwolves @memgrizz @utahjazz @nuggets @Lakers @Bucks @MiamiHEAT @BrooklynNets The fact the Timberwolves are actually good, trynna catch the 2 above us, yet denver and Mavs are also on fire at 12-3🤣🤣@30reacts @wtf_rudy @nbaoficialtrash @sjseric @Suns This man does just a fine job at it🥴 https://t.co/OH5lad6bHb@wtf_rudy @30reacts @nbaoficialtrash @sjseric @Suns It isn’t a play style thing with PHX. Our guys are just stepping up😂😂 a finger injury isn’t gonna affect CP3 when he gets back either.Please don’t make me feel this pain @Suns@humbl3rumbl3 @Suns @NBA not extending his contract early was the best move to extract maximum effort out of DA..  Hes going to EARN max contract now, not just be handed it.@30reacts @nbaoficialtrash @sjseric @Suns Wow, good one😶@30reacts @wtf_rudy @nbaoficialtrash @sjseric @Suns Your team can’t even beat those worst teams in the league🤣🤣😭🤣@Dakodas_Dad @Suns @chicagobulls Dakoda happy Friday@Dakodas_Dad @Suns @chicagobulls Teaching class today, then headed to the game! I got my uniform ready! BAD NEWS BULLS!!!!! https://t.co/s9yEzCXqDZ@DonDavious @30reacts @nbaoficialtrash @sjseric @Suns Right; teams without their All-Star/Olympians would play worse. It's a play style thing with PHX. In reality all healed injuries still leaves CP one handed; PHX can't make up for that. 2017 is an example of a really good team not healthy when they need to be. Steph normal by WCF.@30reacts @wtf_rudy @nbaoficialtrash @sjseric @Suns A 1 point win compared to a 30 point blowout. Yep, totally better😂🤣@brawadis you need to watch #HumanResources I think there’s someone on there that’s more obsessed with the Phoenix Suns than you. https://t.co/l4Vp6GNyrb@30reacts @nbaoficialtrash @sjseric @Suns Keep staying mad, I’ve ran circles around you lil bro. You aren’t scary in the slightest. Still haven’t shown any part of you IRL either😂😂 all talk.@akjakalope @Suns Let’s take what’s ours!!!! The Greek Freak won’t scare us this time. We’re prepared this time!!!!!!@AlexDn09 @Suns @FootprintCNTR @CarMax @chicagobulls @BALLYSPORTSAZ @AZSports @az_mejor Somebody doesn’t watch basketball…@wtf_rudy @30reacts @nbaoficialtrash @sjseric @Suns Suns have literally had a higher assist average since CP3 went down. Are all warriors fans just stupid? We’ve literally won games without Booker AND CP3😂😂😂 also, we blew out the Pelicans recently.@30reacts @wtf_rudy @nbaoficialtrash @sjseric @Suns Not when the team is fully healthy like your team was😂😂 suns had a ton of injuries too. Booker’s broken nose, Booker’s hamstring injury. CP3 blowing up his shoulder, CP3 getting a torn ligament in his shooting hand. Cam Payne’s ankle injury, Cam J getting food poisoning, etc…@DonDavious @30reacts @nbaoficialtrash @sjseric @Suns Every team gets worse you take an All-Star off. PHX benefits from having a good record over an Injured GS and a bunch of ROY led teams. And losing to the Pelicans don't exactly lead to believable team ball; they play chaotic like GS. Suns gotta worry about DAL or MEM first.@30reacts @nbaoficialtrash @sjseric @Suns And I’ve caught a body. It basically murder with what I’m doing to you😂😂@30reacts @nbaoficialtrash @sjseric @Suns You have been owned😂😂 keep crying about it🤣@angelinams112 @ridiculouscage @Suns Let's go! 🧡💜🧡💜@30reacts @wtf_rudy @nbaoficialtrash @sjseric @Suns Okay? Now that you’ve reminded me, try and refute what I said. You can’t😂@30reacts @nbaoficialtrash @sjseric @Suns No, we’ve missed more players and more impactful players. The bubble size is how impactful the missing players are. The suns bubble is bigger than the warriors bubble. Basic knowlege😂😂@30reacts @DonDavious @nbaoficialtrash @sjseric @Suns All PHX got is last year's experience; gotta win a bunch of ways. It's why some still believe in Lbj. Suns got a diet Tatum and a 1-handed CP. Warriors aren't the only West team better PHX.@30reacts @nbaoficialtrash @sjseric @Suns Lmao, nothing to say so you start to attack me personally again. You lose, I win🤪😜@30reacts @wtf_rudy @nbaoficialtrash @sjseric @Suns Don’t dodge it, you know it’s true.@30reacts @nbaoficialtrash @sjseric @Suns This chart has everything you need to know. Read it and you will see that my point is proven. Unless you have a problem with that🥴@30reacts @DonDavious @nbaoficialtrash @sjseric @Suns Duh no one wants GS to win. Their too good and Draymond ugly. MJ had this problem it wasn't always roses; same for Kobe/Duncan. Steph teams known to end games in 3Qs; that's embarrassing. Everyone come healthy, even give Kyrie a pass let everyone play - Warriors in 6 no more.@30reacts @nbaoficialtrash @sjseric @Suns Literally added a top 2 player in his prime. If KD went to the Cavs, they would sweep y’all too😂😂@wtf_rudy @30reacts @nbaoficialtrash @sjseric @Suns Imagine if the suns played the bucks without Middleton and Holiday. That’s similar to what the Warriors played in that finals, didn’t matter if they were young, suns are too.@30reacts @nbaoficialtrash @sjseric @Suns All I need to say😂 Nothing you can say now will debunk this🥱 another point for me https://t.co/upkj09Qy4R@kirkgoldsberry @celtics @Suns @Timberwolves @memgrizz @utahjazz @nuggets @Lakers @Bucks @MiamiHEAT @BrooklynNets Didn't realize the 76ers were so mediocre 😕@DonDavious @30reacts @nbaoficialtrash @sjseric @Suns Warriors we're a young team; Bron got beat by an up and coming young team when his team wasn't stacked. No one saw them winning with Steph and a 1st year GM turned coach.@30reacts @wtf_rudy @nbaoficialtrash @sjseric @Suns Oh yea, I’ve totally seen it this year. With their inability to get a functional offense without Draymond😂😂 while the suns are even better at team ball without CP3 rn. You’ve got it switched around buddy.@Celtlord9 @Suns U definitely should!! Tht was tha Game before they played Indy @ tha end of Feb rite?@30reacts @nbaoficialtrash @sjseric @Suns I love how you call me a hypocrite when that’s all you are😭😭 don’t dodge my statement either.@30reacts @nbaoficialtrash @sjseric @Suns Suns have had worse injury luck. 2 player son your team doesn’t equal 5 on ours😂😂 I’ve said no lie either, nice try thoChris Paul won't play when the Bulls visit Phoenix Friday night

But a matchup with the Suns is an opportunity to reflect on the similarities in leadership impact between him and DeMar DeRozan (via @KCJHoop)

https://t.co/YiTpk2xSUo@DonDavious @nbaoficialtrash @30reacts @sjseric @Suns He lost Game 5 the next year with No KD though. Steph gave CP and James a 2 quarter head start. Rockets weren't a weak team; one of the best in recent history tbh.@kirkgoldsberry @celtics @Suns @Timberwolves @memgrizz @utahjazz @nuggets @Lakers @Bucks @MiamiHEAT @BrooklynNets Wolves back, baby@DonDavious @30reacts @nbaoficialtrash @sjseric @Suns All doubts are fair and all facts are real. Steph still the scariest player in the sport. Let teams stop selling out in traps they might start shooting t-shirts to the crowd when teams take out. All squads have to come healthy; bring the league back. https://t.co/GH2L5cIMFSjust want a @suns win for my birthday@angelinams112 @ridiculouscage @Suns 🧡💜🧡💜🧡💜🧡💜🧡💜🧡💜 would love to win some suns gear :)@kirkgoldsberry @celtics @Suns @Timberwolves @memgrizz @utahjazz @nuggets @Lakers @Bucks @MiamiHEAT @BrooklynNets Celtics really turned everything around!@atrupar @kirkgoldsberry @celtics @Suns @Timberwolves @memgrizz @utahjazz @nuggets @Lakers @Bucks @MiamiHEAT @BrooklynNets Actively tanking@kirkgoldsberry @celtics @Suns @Timberwolves @memgrizz @utahjazz @nuggets @Lakers @Bucks @MiamiHEAT @BrooklynNets Spurs@angelinams112 @ridiculouscage @Suns 🟣🟠D Book goes for 40 tonite!@humbl3rumbl3 @Suns @NBA It’s not possible.@Suns @FootprintCNTR @CarMax @chicagobulls @BALLYSPORTSAZ @AZSports @az_mejor Maybe lower your ticket prices and I’ll go to the game.

#UKBullsFB #BullsNation https://t.co/1EwMoJorwf@30reacts @DonDavious @sjseric @Suns I'm gonna go out on a whim here and say that you rarely watch a lick of basketball outside of the Warriors. Correct?Organisations urge pupils to become Climate Action Heroes – Phoenix Sun https://t.co/XUiwJRoFNr@djtribaltouch @withregram @PhoenixMercury @Suns I have another version coming out soon!@nbaoficialtrash @30reacts @sjseric @Suns And if you think about it. Would CP3 ever let his team miss 27 straight 3’s? No, he would’ve controlled the offense with his middy game and get better looks from 3.@30reacts @DonDavious @sjseric @Suns I'm referring to cp3's game 5 injury (obviously). No, he wasn't playing in game 6 and 7 lol.I might be a suns fan after this year. @Suns@30reacts @DonDavious @sjseric @Suns Correct. You've also seen them get close and fail. Phoenix is more comparable to 2012-13 Warriors. Easy to forget that this was Booker and co.'s first taste of playoff action. Many years to come@30reacts @nbaoficialtrash @sjseric @Suns That’s because the team had KD along with prime Steph and Klay. This team has shown that they cannot handle injuries nearly as good as the suns. Only thing y’all have better than us is Steph potentially going off, which will be pretty damn tough against Bridges🤷‍♂️Phoenix Sun - https://t.co/xIj32wGvZ8 https://t.co/YX6Zws8mZO@30reacts @DonDavious @sjseric @Suns Also, was referring specifically to Draymond. Not the Warriors franchise historically@30reacts @DonDavious @sjseric @Suns The point guard of that team that was one hamstring injury away from finishing the job against y'all? But yee, certainly been a problem for him.@BALLYSPORTSAZ @Dbacks @Suns @ArizonaCoyotes @PHXRisingFC I never get to watch them either.  Then if they are on NBA TV it’s blacked out@30reacts @DonDavious @sjseric @Suns Try to respond to the question challenge@30reacts @DonDavious @sjseric @Suns Who on the Suns is obnoxious enough to say they're winning the chip this year regardless of seeding? Draymond won't have his daddy KD to save him this year.@AaryanS19 Who remember phoenix suns’ last title?@zSneakerHeadz Bring the Cough Drops, Phoenix Suns and Paranorman's back. I'll cop every single pair in the same day if needed.@RkyMtnSunDevil @RasJosh10 @Suns I was unfortunate enough to sit by a Nugget fan and he was obnoxious and rude. It didn’t matter though, nothing could ruin that moment for me. My adrenaline was too loud 😂Hi, to all of my new followers!! It’s been a blast reading all of your amazing @Suns stories, and hearing how you came to love this team. The game of basketball has been my life since I was 7………@ShonaCleary @RkyMtnSunDevil @Suns Energy was all time.@30reacts @DonDavious @sjseric @Suns Congrats. Does literally nothing to disprove my point in this specific circumstance@ShonaCleary @RasJosh10 @Suns I was at 3 &amp; 4 as I had just moved to Denver from NYC and obviously couldn’t pass up the chance. Quickly realized how awful Denver sports fans are.@RkyMtnSunDevil @RasJosh10 @Suns I was at Game 1, so I got some live action in that sweep. It was glorious.@RasJosh10 @ShonaCleary @Suns Hoping I get another series in Denver for another sweep https://t.co/wvWZXTkY5z@vurnt22 I think I was at that show? Like, 50/50. The color footage from Rattle and Hum was shot over 2 nights at Sun Devil Stadium in Phoenix and I was at one of them. Got to Phoenix from Calgary a day or 2 b4 the show, and managed to get tickets. For $5. FiVE. DOLLARS!!@caseyvitelli @Suns @DevinBook @Nike @nikebasketball @Jumpman23 @unimockups @sportsTemplate Nice 👍Phoenix Suns&gt;&lt; free Brittney 🤔 https://t.co/q3ymDY4B1q@DaveKingNBA @BrightSideSun Great article.  People haven't noticed that @Suns players have missed a lot of games this year.  Ayton, Cam and Cam, Book, Paul, Shamet, Crowder, Mcgee.  It's about 100 combined.@ShonaCleary @Suns I felt pain during that missed Kobe missed shot and Ron Artest put back, and the Suns losing in the Finals. And through all the bad seasons and getting to watch Goran leave but Book grow. I have never let go of the love I have for this team. But agreed we're getting closer.I once met @paddyb11 at Scottsdale Fashion Square - froze up and said hello Mr. Burke and he said hi back. He was my favorite @Suns player and now it’s finally come full circle! Hope you can make it back to AZ once @DevinBook and @CP3 win us a championship this year! https://t.co/NbNqbzstuv@ShonaCleary @Suns I moved here in 08 from Utah entering my freshman year not having much love for the game. But entering that magical season and the squad we had during the 09-10 season gave me so much passion. I'm here and excited and I can say we have an opportunity to be in the history books.@30reacts @DonDavious @sjseric @Suns This is all I can think of anytime Draymond says some dumbass shit (which is often) https://t.co/2zdhxMZtf8@caseyvitelli @Suns @DevinBook @Nike @nikebasketball @Jumpman23 @unimockups @sportsTemplate I think a dark grey would be so dope@ctsbulls @chicagobulls @Suns @670TheScore @Audacy @34billy42 @AlyssaBergamini Don't you ever sleep Chuck?@azcentral Sorry grace is out the window. She is a pinhead blowhole. Is there something in the dust that turns out these crazy people in droves in Phoenix? Too much sun? What a sad state of affairs.@brandontraann @Kyl_val Hello Brandon!
