I hope you don’t have any plans tonight, because this Eastern Conference clash between the @chicagobulls and @BrooklynNets is going to be incredible.

Patrick williams will be back. And the series would go 6-7 don't know who would win but it would be funNBA PLAYS TODAY 🏀
Chicago Bulls -1.5 (3u)

Favorite Play of the day tbh, really see the Bulls come out firing and pulling it off in a close one. 

Rockets +6.5 (2u)

The spurs are decent but most definitely not a 6.5 point favorite over a fast and young rockets team. https://t.co/giH7QrGmxJPro Standard NBA Chicago Bulls Stacked Logo Hoodie on sale for $59.98

https://t.co/bCbz4pMalqSo the Bulls hold a 2-0 season series lead over the Nets this season. Both of those games were second games of back-to-backs.

Brooklyn enters Chicago with a league-best road record (14-4) and haven’t lost two road games in the same month yet.

📻 WFAN https://t.co/xhuxeyekTH@NBA @dallasmavs @nyknicks @BrooklynNets @chicagobulls why is a game in chicago starting at 9pm@DeMar_DeRozan on the bulls is the best decision he made @chicagobulls@timjsinclair @NBAAllStar @NBA @chicagobulls Thats awesome! Congratulations! Didnt realise i wasn't following you, that has been rectified. Would love a follow back my man, you'd be in the esteemed company of the @chicagobulls and @Stacey21King 👀🔴@BN_Bulls With how frequent the post-deadline vet signings happen, I wouldn't be surprised if no trades are made unless they find some fantastic deal. Maybe Thad Young and/or Daniel Theis find their way back to Chicago that way without the Bulls having to send a nice piece away.@balldontstop @chicagobulls Elite? That's a fucking joke. Dude has zero defenseCongratulations to MK4040 (@MK4040_) who moved up 1 spot to take #2 on the Chicago Bulls team leaderboard.

#BullsNation https://t.co/pwBxxqlhGJCouldn't be more excited to be the voice of the 2022 @NBAAllStar game in #cleveland next month! Huge thank you to the @NBA and the @chicagobulls for this amazing opportunity! #allstar #nba #chicago https://t.co/aqnfyJgbbhAccording to sources the reason why the @nyknicks are playing before the @chicagobulls tonight, is because the Knicks game is just an appetizer. The Bulls game is the main courseSup @tacobell the @chicagobulls won by 46 last night. 4 + 6 = 10 and that’s what you are. A perfect 10. Regardless if you join the @washedupinc team or not I always want you to remember that. Don’t let anyone tell you otherwise.@elijah_mcintosh I think the bulls defense would be too overwhelming, I’m not saying Chicago is winning. But it’s def a 7 game seriesI'm glad to support two teams who the league had low expectations for this year. @chicagobulls and @memgrizz it would be crazy if they met in the finals. 

Of course then it would be #BullsNation time to shine@icebergsli6 @PyrexPixels @stephenasmith @memgrizz @JaMorant @chicagobulls Yea it has nothing to do with him bein the best all around player on the planet i guess@J1mboSlice_ @chicagobulls Jimbo nice with it @chicagobullsMarcus Morris or Serge Ibaka please @chicagobulls https://t.co/DkbCDtccc9The Chicago Bulls are 1st in the East and 3rd in the whole league.

They can count on Coby for scoring punch off the bench in a way that works with the team’s chemistry right now. They need a big who can help limit a KD or Giannis. Sign a vet for that, or wait for PWill to come back. (All imo, of course.)@mcnees @ztwhite23 @chicagobulls @CobyWhite @AyoDos_11 My singular point is you misrepresented, as fact, that Coby is younger.  It’s simply untrue.
