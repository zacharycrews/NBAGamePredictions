There's supposedly nine teams who made offers. Rumor out of Toronto is the Raptors offered Siakam. Morey is asking for a king's ransom that no team will pay. He deserves a lot of the blame.The @Raptors look to start their season on the right foot by containing Bradley Beal and the new-look @WashWizards.

@WashWizards Game at 7:30pm vs @Raptors!!!!!
My 3 Predictions:
-Bradley Beal will score 35+ points and have 2+ steals
-KCP will make 4 or more 3 pointers
-Montrezl Harrell will have 12+ points and 8+ rebounds
(The Wizards Will Win 126-117)

Screw big corporations, and YES, the Raptors are a corporation.I have a very good feeling about this @Raptors team. They’re young, hungry and drama-free. My only expectations are that they play hard every night and never back down. They’ll win some and probably lose a lot, but I’m here for the journey. #WeTheNorth #RTZ@Raptors pt.1: As a season seat holder for many years, I have to mention a few things: seat holders seem to be paying more of a price than others.

#NBATwitterHamza Ndayisaba, 19, Talon Nadeau, 18 flew from Vancouver to Toronto for Raptors Opening night. The pair have been waiting years for the opportunity to see Canada’s team. https://t.co/3u5JuPj2wh@PlayStationCA @Raptors @Sportsnet It's pretty easy to say my fav moment in Raps history is when Kawhi hit that buzzer beater shot in 2019 playoffs so I'll go with when Vince Carter brought the roof down in 2000, winning the slam dunk contest. 💪 Till then, we were just the little Dinos. #Rapshomeopener #ContestWelcome home @Raptors @the_raptor #WeBack #WeTheNorth@holliepollard_ @Raptors The prices tonight are higher than what I have paid for playoff tickets in the past. Seriously, $300 for a pair of tickets near the roof to see the raps play the horrible Washington Wizards?  Even I, a die hard Raps fan, would never pay that amount for those seats.So heading into Toronto for the raptors game and we deadass got passed by the train we were supposed to catch lol so we just gonna drive to TorontoHey @Raptors,

Of course, winning can't be ignoredHopefully some point soon I'm actually checking out a Raptors game live, but as for right now it's so cool to just be living in Toronto the day of the Raptors home opener.“I think it’s gonna have that type of atmosphere because we Raptors fans are hungry, we’re starved, and we just can not wait to get back in that arena.”

My thoughts on why no game in Toronto.
1. NBA wanted a marquee event in NYC
2. When making up the sked, was there a guarantee the Raptors would be in Toronto?  And, if they were, would fans be allowed in?  May have played a role.
3. Get #yyc a CEBL team!
