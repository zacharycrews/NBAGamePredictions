@DKSportsbook https://t.co/KjkVyg0J80#NetsWorld Something I realized about Claxton is that he's got the offense of a Center, the body of a PF, and the defense of a Guard.

More than enough time to figure out the rotations. No reason Bembry only got 7 minutes of burn vs Bucks

6. Rebounding fundamentals poor(no one boxes out)
7. They don't funnel the ball to the weaker offensive threats to help the defense
8. Too flamboyant to do the dirty work(KD exception)@BrooklynNets Nets Problems:
1. Offensive pace, Harden gets into sets 12 seconds or less
2. No off ball movement on offense
3. D'Antoni offense better than Nash by a mile
4.
