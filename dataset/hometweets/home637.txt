Larry Bird was a member of one of the greatest teams of all time.

Only the 1987 Lakers and 1996 Bulls were on the same level as the 1986 Celtics.

No player or team today would win a playoff series against those Big 3 Boston Celtics. https://t.co/xUgj3dCMQb https://t.co/Td28BxWvXs@NBATradeAlerts I‚Äôm pretty sure J.

#BleedGreen https://t.co/H8xd5oPHT4@therealnedbrady @DanteOnDeck @celtics Barnes is definitely a good scorer.

Hope the @tdgarden crowd helps boost the @Celtics vs Bulls tomorrow. #BOSvsPHIBums @celtics@celtics This Celtics coach gives up on games way too early.. down 17 with 8 minutes left he throws in the towel. This is pro basketball! It‚Äôs not impossible to overcome that deficit and it‚Äôs not the first time he‚Äôs done it.
