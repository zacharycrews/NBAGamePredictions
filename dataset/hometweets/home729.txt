UTA are 0-3 this season w/o Mitchell and Gobert and have 24th DEF RTG over L10 games. MEM are 7-3 in L10 games and at home here, revenge game for MEM after UTA beat them in playoffs last season. Expecting a comfortable MEM win.

He has proven from time to time that he is an all-star.If my @memgrizz were in the eastern conference like we're suppose to be, we'd be the #1 seed..@TrashBoatGoat1 @NBATV @JaMorant @memgrizz Hold your breath. Lol@MikeRos95911018 @NBATV @JaMorant @memgrizz Reserve@ClayJam98847695 @NBATV @JaMorant @memgrizz You are one of a few. Klay certainly isn’t a All Star this year. He’s only played a few games and hasn’t played like an All Star after returning to the court. I know it’s early but I would wager that Ja will be a All Star starter for many years if he can avoid serious injury.GOJA🏀 Lebron James earned his record 18th naming in the All-Star team, and he will be the captain and first lineup member with
