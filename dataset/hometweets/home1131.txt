Spent a great evening with amazing hospitality. https://t.co/jnrGpJoK1Z@Ryleesjustvibin @SoberMiamiFan Brooklyn just lost to the hornets not scared of the netsAs the playoff bracket currently stands :

The Brooklyn Nets would play the Philadelphia 76ers in the first round if they won their play-in game.At this point, for the Nets, it’s a battle to stay 8th with Charlotte &amp; Atlanta both within a game of Brooklyn.

Additionally, Nets fans should root for Toronto to stay above Cleveland.

Best case realistic scenario at this point seems to be Nets @ Cavs in the 7-8 matchup.Brooklyn Nets you better whoop Detroits Ass. https://t.co/JLHHYaVxfZ#NBA Andre Drummond is not staying with Brooklyn Nets (via @ByAryannaPrasad) https://t.co/ok0WWOSOIDFollowing a Charlotte Hornets loss against the Nuggets…

Your Brooklyn Nets are back as the 8 seed in the Eastern Conference (.5 game up)

Which is why the Nets lost while the Hornets were in NY chilling with fresh legs waiting for us to come back to Brooklyn. Now it was their turn.Denver holds on late and beats Charlotte. Brooklyn moves back into 8th place.

Boston and Toronto in a tight one late. Another game with implications for the Nets.@BrooklynNets back at 8th seed 🙏@awaytoworthy Brooklyn NetsAnd a little under 24 hours later, the Brooklyn Nets are back in the eighth seed. They lead Charlotte by one loss.@ThisAintRasheed Exactly. Caught a couple Nets games in Brooklyn so far this season. I would like to watch Kyrie play, and now I get the chance later this week.Denver beats Charlotte 113-109 to tentatively push the Brooklyn Nets back into the 8-seed in the East by 0.5 games. 

The Nuggets are now 2 games up on the Timberwolves for the 6-seed and just 0.5 games behind the Jazz for the 5-seed in the West.@NetsDaily @NetsKingdomAJ @Nelley_J @BrooklynNets @brooklynsbeat @DougNorrie
If Raptors win and Knicks beat the Bulls, Toronto will be tied for #5 seed! That would be great because I want the Raptors as far away from a play-in scenario as possible 😉 https://t.co/gaiyofuHA7Covid really destroyed the Brooklyn NetsNBA Power Rankings, Week 24: Can Kyrie Irving propel the Brooklyn Nets out of the play-in tournam... - via @ESPN App.  #NBA.  https://t.co/ZaHxEj98ItSocioeconomic Privilege @BrooklynNets.
