Donovan won player of the month in Dec. and Gobert is knocking on the door as a top 10 player in the NBA. Two fringe top 15 players plus a great cast (idk if the Jazz have that) could have a punchers chance imo but yeah I don’t love Utah’s odds.@SpencerKeele @MiamiHEAT Miami was never LeBron’s home.@SpencerKeele @MiamiHEAT Kawhi wasn’t close to being a top 5 player when SA won the title.Brandon Rosenthal | NBA Miami Heat Side Pick and Roll Set Play

Bring LeBron James home by giving Bam &amp; Herro to the Lakers and now u got a championship team.
