Think we see plenty of offense in this one. Minnesota holds the leagues highest scoring offense while Houston has the leagues worst scoring defense so I think Minnesota should see no problem scoring a ton.

Over in 13/18 games w/o Pat Bev this season (avg. 9.3 APG), including 7 in 25 min &amp; 10 in 33 min in two games vs. Houston.

Rockets are atrocious defensively, awesome matchup.

https://t.co/hb0korPtlS@g_money_stud @Jibrilinho @LakersLead @KingJames @HoustonRockets He could miss those games because he was more valuable when he did play, because when he did they won so much he could afford to have a break
Not his fault LeBron had to play all 82 for the Cavs to even make it into the 5th seed@adams249142 @Jibrilinho @LakersLead @KingJames @HoustonRockets obviously Lebron was more valuable than Harden

Missing the 10 games is huge

how do u add value to your team if you don't play?

The Rockets had 6 wins &amp; 4 losses in the games Harden missed

LOL

How valuable?
