Mostly Expected. Sucks that I still haven't gotten a better serial than #4, but at least I stay loyal to my soil @SacramentoKings !
#NBATopShotThis #HNY2022 https://t.co/qmfPESUCKD@AdamTaylorNBA I’d look at Sacramento and see if a Brown and Fox trade is doable. Fox is kinda getting pushed out by Hailburton. And the Kings want to win games. Brown and Horford for Fox and Barnes works in my mind.🏀 𝗚𝗔𝗠𝗘𝗗𝗔𝗬 🏀

Landing a wing shooter or Myles Turner via trade and letting Haliburton run "point" puts team 1st.@couchtomato62 @simshine95 @DamonAndRatto @GSWReddit @anthonyVslater The mavs played the kings yesterday that morning they signed IT to a 10 day and flew him from Seattle to Sacramento and he played@SacramentoKings I dogged the Laker fans when they did this to their rookie who had the game winner vs the Mavs . The Lakers won in OT vs no Luka D. Playing . Great win but let’s not forget the Mavs we’re missing 9 players and Luka. Game should have not been that close .  💯🦾#youtube Kristaps Porzingis on Chimezie Metu's BUZZER-BEATER for Sacramento Kings vs Dallas Mavericks https://t.co/y9dBNTWNIi#youtube Chimezie Metu on his BUZZER-BEATER for the Sacramento Kings to BEAT the Dallas Mavericks https://t.co/l74ohDnBat@KS23111 @SacramentoKings Why are you even here trolling on a Kings tweet, did they beat your team or something?

*not a personal endorsement of alcohol* https://t.co/CLUkSxf8OM@BooneFollow187 @swipathefox @SacramentoKings 9 more actually, and no? i literally called him a terrible defender in my original comment 😭 all i was talking ab was that u shouldn’t discredit jalen’s scoring ability just because fox is a shit defender lolLast 2 cards:
Well my collection is looking like a Sacramento Kings team https://t.co/EzimwQEjqj@YeoStyles @swipathefox @SacramentoKings so he is averaging 16 currently and he scored 10 MORE POINTS ON FOX!!! 

AND THAT IS OKAY TO PEOPLE LIKE YOU LOLDear @disney, @wbpictures, @ParamountPics, or @UniversalPics,

Could one of you remake a basketball version of “Major League” with the Sacramento Kings so Kings fans can at least imagine winning the Conference Championship? 

Thanks in advance!@BooneFollow187 @swipathefox @SacramentoKings okay? ☠️ why does his career avg matter when he’s avging 16 currently lol. and i said “been extremely EFFICIENT and a DECENT scorer” nothing u did disproved that. 50-37% are great for an undersized guard and 16 ppg is decent.@PeachJames_ Ever since the Sacramento Kings got robbed you can’t trust a ref@vegandoIan @Jedidieugh @TraeBetta @statmuse @TyHaliburton22 @SacramentoKings Well I didn't mean they can't make the playoffs. And while I recognize that would be significant, they are unlikely to make a run if they do.i’ve never met a sacramento kings fan ever@YeoStyles @swipathefox @SacramentoKings Career = 11 ppg https://t.co/zlg16oz9X5Congratulations to Waltmester (@itsonlywalter), DukeNukem and J_Money_82 (@ScarCit06427004) who moved up to take #8, #9 and #10 on the Sacramento Kings team leaderboard.

https://t.co/WHnq2718B3@sportssapphic What you always want to do is trade players for worse players.

Sacramento fans are lucky to have him on the call so often.@TRaw9225 @LakeShowYo @Lakers Lakers got a Big-3 where all 3 superstar players attack inside the 3-point line doesn’t make sense. Needed a FLOOR SPACER as the 3rd scoring option. Lebron is a better passer than Sacramento Kings guards#ChimezieMetu hits 3 at buzzer, Kings beat #Mavs 95-94

Thomas will miss the next rematch game due to entering covid protocols.
