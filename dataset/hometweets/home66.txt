Houston Rockets + 9 1/2@MessiahCranky @HoustonRockets It’s been 4 fucking games man. LolVery humbled tonight to be part of Filipino Heritage Night here at Toyota Center - especially the opportunity to witness the NBA’s first meeting of players of Filipino descent, Jordan Clarkson &amp; Jalen Green. As always let’s go @HoustonRockets and #LightTheFuse@PrideOfLR @Shareendidit @HoustonRockets LMAO, but is she lying tho?Two players of Filipino descent playing in Thursday’s Houston Rockets game https://t.co/1FZfo5IT3JTwo players of Filipino descent playing in Thursday’s Houston Rockets game https://t.co/Bh8EZeVFJF@Dmac252PGMG3 @Jeff_Shull @HoustonRockets Lol. Not even remotely close to being true. Have you not actually watched them play, or are you just in denial?@BuckieLakers @HoustonRockets you arebnot going tobgetba trade partner for a guy who never played much.  Make him play and earn that trade.@HoustonRockets @MichelobULTRA @JalenGreen @o_tate_ We demand KPJ pics@HoustonRockets @MichelobULTRA @JalenGreen @o_tate_ Drippiest team in the league? ❌
DRIPPIEST TEAM IN THE LEAGUE ✔️🔥🔥@Jeff_Shull @HoustonRockets I mean.... Mobley is still much better, lol. It isnt really debatable. Basically the same amount of PPG on much higher percentage, same APG, plus far more rebounds, blocks, &amp; steals, while also playing elite defense 1 - 5. One hot shooting game doesnt magically change that.Thursday night locks :: Chicago Bulls -1 and ocer215 total points, Detroit Pistons +9.5 and over 212 total points, Green Bay Packers -6 and over 50.5 total points, Houston Rockets +9.5, San Antonio Spurs +6 and Coastal Carolina -17 .@Shareendidit @HoustonRockets I hate you with the heat of 1000 suns!!!!!!!Chicago Bulls - New York Knicks
