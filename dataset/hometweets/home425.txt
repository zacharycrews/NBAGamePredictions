He’s a good rebuilder but he can’t capitalize on it and make a championship teamThe reason Utah Jazz had low OffRtg to start the season was their poor 3pt shooting. Once they reverted to normal, their numbers picked up. I think the Warriors' case will be like that once they start making those open 3s and free throws.“The guys like him are invaluable, and make your team who they are,” Utah Jazz guard Mike Conley said of teammate Royce O'Neale. “We know who he is for us and how much we value him, regardless of what the outside world might think.” https://t.co/CBDzw0GYdG@Regalbeast1 @utahjazz Amen!!!Steve Budin

They won’t play another regularly scheduled game on a Tuesday until March 29, 2022. #takenote@parker_andorasu @utahjazz Happy birthday! 😂@Yg_Trece please be healthy and play tomorrow.

#TakeNote | @WasatchFord@utahjazz Im not gonna complain https://t.co/IrDKxJfExE@JMCCLEARY_10 @utahjazz Ironically, I was 33 last game. I'm now 34.How old were you the last time the @utahjazz played a basketball game? 

#TakeNoteYo did the @utahjazz forfeit the season ??? 😂 damn they haven’t played in like 3 weeks 😅 #takenoteUtah Jazz might overtake Warriors in NetRtg later today. They play the shorthanded Clippers and are on a roll.@RyanStipUTES @utahjazz Mandie and I were just talking about this.Imagine if Michael Jordan had social media he’d have been the most petty mofo on planet earth like imagine Twitter being around after the 1998 finals and MJ quote tweets the Utah Jazz and just says “Ratio.” 😂😂😂@kslsports @utahjazz Alec Burks and Bryan Russel.  Going down in history.  The wrong side of it.@JayCoolBeans @utahjazz @wgu Nuggets are irrelevant to the conversation. We shouldn’t be compared to an inferior franchise. You’re right on the golden state and Houston years. But the year we lost in the bubble people expected more from that rosterToday at Bingham High our very own Mr. Thornley was recognized as the Utah Jazz most valuable teacher.This recognition comes with a $1,000 classroom grant, six (6)  tickets in Instructure's suite to the Dec.15 Jazz game, recognition during the game and a personalized Jazz jersey. https://t.co/rRnA604NEy@botalumePT @MLS @NHL Lol I don't know, New Orleans Pelicans and Utah Jazz are in the conversation.@utahjazz @JordanClarksons @RudyGay @Joeingles7 Bored https://t.co/5onkMNOZTy@van_jensen If you ever get a chance to sit that close for a Utah Jazz game … make sure whatever you do … DON’T TALK ABOUT QUINN SNYDER’S #$@!% WIFE!@C_SaccoIV @utahjazz @wgu Even the Nuggets two years ago we weren’t favored going in. That one just stings cuz we were up 3-1 😬@utahjazz I'll take it! https://t.co/AmMgRB9l9k@C_SaccoIV @utahjazz @wgu Also, I think last year was the only year we fell below playoff expectations. Every year before we either met or exceeded expectations. If you were expecting to beat Houston and Golden State the last several years I think your expectations were a little too high@C_SaccoIV @utahjazz @wgu When you said all their regular season wins mean NOTHING to you that really threw me off. I don’t understand that. I totally agree championship is the goal, but I still have fun cheering for a good team during the season.@JayCoolBeans @utahjazz @wgu Why so cringe at an opinion buddy? Of course that’s all I care about. I have fun watching the Jazz wins. I don’t root for them to lose 🤣 the championship is the goal. And if you don’t win it when you’re a contender, it’s a lost season. But it’s okay, let’s be like the Cubs 😂@utahjazz @UofUHealth He’s health as been amazing the past few years, that’s a big accomplishment for a guy his size. Keep it up Rudy! 💪Random tweet … just noticed that the Jazz only 5️⃣ home games in January 😬

So ya best enjoy these 7️⃣ homes game in December
