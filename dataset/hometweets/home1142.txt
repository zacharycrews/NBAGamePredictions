I think in going to GSW, he just chose the NBA@All_Things_Mavs @KevinOConnorNBA Would you intentionally lose the last game of the year against the spurs if the 3 seed was still on the line but doing so would knock the lakers out and cause San Antonio to lose its pick?  What if the 4 seed was locked up and 3 seed wasn’t available?@money_talks65 @CKeeley1021 @WildIndian5 @Trevor_Lane If you think the Lakers would love Jayson Tatum, why wouldn’t the San Antonio Spurs love Jayson Tatum who is better than Brandon Ingram ? 😂😂

San Antonio will make the play-in game if they win as many games as the Lakers for the rest of the season.

https://t.co/ysQqIsELoZ@money_talks65 @CKeeley1021 @WildIndian5 @Trevor_Lane Jayson Tatum would be playing for the San Antonio Spurs in exchange for Kawhi Leonard BEFORE THE FREE AGENCY PERIOD SIGNING OF LEBRON. 😂😂😂 Kawhi would have had no choice because it’s a trade to the Lakers before Lebron joined.The last 4 all stars the Spurs drafted - Dejounte Murray, Kawhi Leonard, Tony Parker, Manu Ginobili we're all taken with picks outside the lottery. Not saying this will or should happen, but if there is any franchise that should not worry about draft spot it's San Antonio https://t.co/rxPbTK5QyB@money_talks65 @CKeeley1021 @WildIndian5 @Trevor_Lane Magic Johnson tried to complete a trade for San Antonio Spurs Kawhi before the NBA Draft and the NBA Draft was before Lebron James’s free agency, remember that too. 👍😂 what?!? No one wants to come to San Antonio!!!!!

And no. The Spurs have been rebuilding since Kawhi left. This has been a 8-10 seed team since. Don’t get it twisted - Spurs haven’t been a perennial playoff team in 4 years. https://t.co/RKEvGcKjqySan Antonio Spurs: 2003/2005/2007/2013

With a loss, the Lakers will fall behind the 9-seeded Pelicans by one game and will be tied with the Spurs for the 10-seed at 31-44.

New Orleans and San Antonio both own tiebreakers over the Lakers right now.
