Here is mine - 13@hhpthebook @nyknicks A bit undersized but the ball handling is there.

We all figured that it was an outlier but the shooting percentages are a fall from grace.@nyknicks @espn @MSGNetworks @BetMGM Cares@honeylaunderin I'm not bothered by their popularity or media reporting on them.

If you build around Barrett (gemini) and Randle (sag).. surround them with players like Dinwiddie (aries) or Bogdanovic (leo)...not Walker (taurus) or Fournier (scorpio).ZION WILLIAMSON WILL GET HIS WAY AND PLAY WITH THE NEW YORK KNICKS!! https://t.co/kJ31LE2TOu@DickieV @LouisvilleMBB @nyknicks should beg Pitino and jurich back@MrChuckD @deucemcb11 @nyknicks @livelikelefty @CPTheFanchise @JDSportsTalkNY @KnicksFanTv @Traticaster101 Props for not including the jersey ads, I wish a lot of other artists would do the samenew york knicks carmelo anthony https://t.co/719KRRO0CX@TheStrickland @nyknicks If Thibs starts Burks tomorrow over IQ the MSG crowd is going to rightfully go nuts and boo mercilessly.

Knicks blew those games because they stop pushing the ball in the 4th (partially because Randle is gassed) and they run either isos or get into a low effort P&amp;Rs with 10 seconds left on the clock.Yeah man that ain’t a problem unique to New Orleans. Football is bigger than basketball anywhere you go that has both NFL and NBA except Los Angeles and New York (and the Yankees are bigger than the Knicks). https://t.co/yVjocD5IWr@KAscuasiati @BrooklynNets Got that right….right after the @nyknicks

Move the @SacKingsUK to Seattle and make them the Sonics. 

Take the @nyknicks and move them to small market (since they play small market ball) Kansas City Knicks

let’s go @nyknicks@DaddyRandle30 @AntiBizle @bkmadisons @hhpthebook @nyknicks IQ’s been absolute garbage this year. Wasting the shot clock dribbling just to brick or turn it over. He literally makes the worst decision he could make on the floor time and time again. His defense is overrated and he fouls too much. There is no way he should start@mung_t @hhpthebook @nyknicks That’s on management. They thought Rose IQ Kemba were the PG going forward but Thibs like Burks managing the ball because of his size against smaller PG’s. he’s going to play Rose IQ Burks at PG because of experience. Thibs don’t want a rook at PG.@hhpthebook @IQ_GodSon @nyknicks Yeah I Kno, that's why I mentioned those heat checks...on my TL when he misses a few it's on and Poppin, when he hit a few its a party.Write this down, that's right.

#LEGENDoftheMiamiHEAT #NBA75@NYPost_Berman 2 of 2.  Besides a narcissistic Head Coach (#Thibodeau) isn't going to allow any "saviour" to be more important than himself.
