After the last 2 Suns / Mavs games we all know you already know who is going to win. NBA and its officiating is pure trash. You can't make it more obvious.  What does the @NBA have to say about CP3's 6th foul?@gonzalez_xc @The_DocHolliday @JaMorant @warriors 1) The fact that you see MD on Twitter and think their opinion on this is valuable is telling.

2) As stated multiple times - whether or not it caused this injury is irrelevant.  It wasn’t a basketball move and it wasn’t just accidental because he missed the ball.  It was dirty.@warriors @KlayThompson @StephenCurry30 LFGOOOOO

This was a man grabbing and pulling on a knee while pushing on the body.@gonzalez_xc @The_DocHolliday @JaMorant @warriors Think you must have misread because you are hard disagreeing with me lmao.

Whether or not Poole caused the injury, what he did was stupid and it’s tough to argue it wasn’t on purpose.  Changing the trajectory of someone’s leg and body (opposite directions) is all it might take.The Golden State Warriors are 14-4 this season when playing on TNT:

However, the Pikkit community seems to think a +10 is too many points, even with Ja Morant listed as doubtful.

- It doesn’t matter if this actually did cause the injury.
- It doesn’t matter what happened in other games or plays.

What matters is that no matter what, Poole grabbed and yanked his knee while pushing him.Memphis is done, Warriors in 5. #GoldenState@Kgformvp211 @The_DocHolliday @JaMorant @warriors You’re a fucking clown bro.  This image is from a play where Ja plants his feet and then Steph runs through his leg, kicking his leg/ankle as he goes and Ja lifts and pulls his leg away either on or to avoid contact (tough to say which but either way this was all Steph).When will you return NBC Sports Bay Area and California?

They got 3 HOFer, still at or near the top of their game... 2 up-n-coming superstars in Poole and Kuminga, and 2-high-potential stars in Wiseman and Moody.

This has certainly become the most drama-filled series in the NBA right now, even though it looks like Golden State might have found its form in a 30-point home victory on Saturday. https://t.co/jc2oOfmpwV@warriors @NemanjaBjelica 20 pts tonight🤝@YumYum84756390 Yeah that’s why the Golden State Warriors sold out every game in Oakland. The problem isn’t the city, it’s the owner.

Retweet to vote #GaryPaytonII for this season’s #NBACommunityAssist award!What we saw in the last game was a Three-dimensional chess match. @SteveKerr is a chess grand master, as a piece gets removed, Another piece is added to the game that is just as good, and has not been brought out before, confusing the opponents that there is no let off. @warriors@SeeSawRrr @DBGyt_ Super team ??? 4 guys the @warriors drafted and Andre Bogut ??? Lol, ok@warriors GP2 not on the LeBron Juice@MartySullivan10 @Yassine79647512 @GrizzliesPR @memgrizz @warriors Ja is good. On the way to the top. Will surely win rings but please not with this team. He doesnt deserve to mentored by someone like JenkinsHe will play.

Which is good for @warriors because @memgrizz are better without @JaMorant 

  Without 80%  vs With 62.5% https://t.co/txvvuTjgIb@The_DocHolliday @warriors love Ja and he is great but this was not the same as brooks shot at all https://t.co/cWDNUsz1sg@mich5562 @TrentonTyler6 @RoyxL_ @LetsBetADollar @GrizzliesPR @memgrizz @warriors I wanna know how strong JP is to hurt Ja with his fingertips. You'd think Ja would have destroyed his knee doing this...
https://t.co/YmjqtZG8gT@GrizzliesPR @memgrizz @warriors I thought his knees were yanked by the Hulk?@The_DocHolliday @warriors this or when he hyper extended and twisted it on a long stride plant a second before Poole pawed at him.   Was not as intentional as some try and make it.  And did you see him try to trip Steph after he went by (down 101-81) or when he kneed steph knocking him down? no angel here https://t.co/Sse4ZRvkvg@warriors Free GP2 Unlike LeBron He doesn’t owe CCP a buttload of $$$@helllooo1989 @warriors So one player is the whole team? Or is it two players? Bro get your head out of your ass I didn’t know gs was made up up 15 draymonds 💀My mom is sending me &amp; my step-dad to @SFGiants game when I go to the Bay Area to visit.

Some grown-up needs to take @JaMorant aside and explain to him the damage he's doing to his future super star career by cultivating this reputation now. https://t.co/Zm1vB8wsIU@ESPNNBA why is it that @SteveKerr and @warriors always injure the main players, when they’re in danger of losing. Breaking the code Og’s@kingsmommy123 @ESPNNBA @warriors Thats what makes it even worse. They were up and still thought Ja was a problem so they had to injure him. The footage shows it was international to no way you can tell me otherwise@Warriors_Guru Y’all acting like Golden state hasn’t been doing dirty shit. They got the dirtiest player in the league .I’m rooting for #JaMorant to be back for game 4. The @Warriors don’t want to win that way. But these crazy conspiracy claims are a bad look for #TaylorJenkins and @memgrizz. And it’s irresponsibly fanning the flames of a heated situation.

Why do warriors fans have so much hate in them@MeGrizzliesMuse @omar74416608 @warriors That makes no sense and most Warrior fans are not happy with Morants injury. However the Grizzlies elevated the physicality of this series and now they are not happy about the outcome because the Warriors didn’t fold. They are just more talented.@warriors Still no jersey to buy in gsw market 😂 went from Paris to buy one, nothing available..@sportillumin8s @GrizzliesPR @memgrizz @warriors It’s the playoffs, you need a star.

Golden State’s Jordan Poole will not be disciplined for his role in the play on which Morant was hurt.
