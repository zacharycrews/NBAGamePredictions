Another loss and poor coaching by Doc@sixers @NBCSPhilly @975TheFanatic @utahjazz @Ticketmaster Don't be a fool just fire Rivers and don't trade Simmons.

Who is cooking Gobert tonight? Last year Ben dropped 42/9/12 at Utah and JoJo dropped 40 points and 19 boards in WCF.

But, I pretty much have to take the Jazz in Salt Lake-with the Sixers not having Embiid, Thybulle or Danny Green.

Even though there appears to be something wrong with Utah.
