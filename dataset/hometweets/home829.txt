It has given him the opportunity to refine his game with excellent developmental coaches. His shot is smoother, his handles tighter, he is more focused in defense. His game is way better than it was.

Would've been right back in championship contention since last year. @KDTrey5 engineered chemistry is not authentic enough to last long.

Mitchell fills the warriors weakness and if you watched the dubs in the PO , you would know that motion offense doesn’t always work.I'm fine with the fact that the @warriors not trading anyone.@warriors Be here and be tweeting nonsense knowing very well that we need a big. See how Jazz molested us in the paint.@AfolabiISR Against a healthy Milwaukee Bucks team or a healthy Phoenix Suns team or a healthy Golden State Warriors team and it's game over for them because they do t have the pieces to offensively and defensively to match these teams in a seven game series.GOLDEN STATE WARRIORS PLAY BASKETBALL TONIGHT@warriors sign a damn rim protector@__JaredJD @warriors It ain’t that necessary if they believe wiseman is returning soonDO SOMETHING?? @warriors@warriors 3 little contenders just got better through trades , you guys still rolling out Damion lee@warriors @NBCSAuthentic @957thegame @MichelobULTRA Im sorry but no way we gonna beat the bucks without another big they got ibaka now!!💀@warriors Okay but get a big@warriors GET CLAXTON https://t.co/1NpAhKBysj@warriors @NBCSAuthentic @957thegame @MichelobULTRA Please win@JohnBNash1 @warriors Plenty to do.@dubsforever7 @warriors Lol Bob is just fine with JTA, Lee and ChiozzaNo @Lakers trade, No @MiamiHEAT trade,No @warriors trade.

He’s not gonna be the answer to all of our problems. With or without Klay, that won’t make our roster any taller hence why we lost that game. It’s Utah, so I can live with it.I hope Golden State Warriors will trade for Mitch Robinson (maybe Nemanja Bjelica and a first round pick)@WongGabriel1 @GodlLotus @warriors @zaza27 Gary is like 6’2 lmao and JTA would get destroyed in the paint@study70335899 @BayAreaSportsF7 @PabzSantos30 @957thegame Get it done @warriors@warriors @Invisalign Dude.

♦︎ @sixers immediately become a Finals favorite (at least tied with @bucks, @suns &amp; @warriors).
♦︎ @BrooklynNets won't win a title soon: Simmons + Kyrie =  insane drama.  But the Beard's contract is expiring, and maybe they get Seth Curry too. https://t.co/ICX8U5pOVi@warriors @Invisalign Why is he so fucking good@warriors please go get a big man today.

Golden State Warriors are going to be champions this season. #gsw #NBA #nbs2022 #GoldenStateWarriorsHi @warriors
You've lost a hardcore Golden State fan today!! 
Either

Won't watch a single match whenever Stephanie plays!@warriors @NBCSAuthentic @957thegame @betwayusa Curry should STOP passing the ball to the younger players who take 3pt shots but fail to convert.@RogerLodge7 @Lakers @warriors And who’s playing for the Lakers? It’s not all Russ’s fault!! They’re terrible and getting outran by everyone@warriors It is quite evident after last night’s loss in Utah they need a big man.Golden State Warriors

Its how you loose! Against good competition step has struggled to score! That will be a problem! Sometimes we need him to stop the bleeding! And be that guaranteed bucket but he hasn’t come through!

#NBA@MikoPalero @baby_face_goat @warriors Might even add Lakers to that also because despite them being a dysfunctional team, the warriors won't match up well in a playoff series.@TheAppleSundae @warriors Tell that to his coach with these loser lineups, last season Steph was being Steph and balling out at will, now he's fitting into the role Kerr has for him. Kerr should just trade him for Westbrook and I am sure the Lakers would win a championship with Steph without all this bs@NBAIndia @Giannis_An34 to @warriors ... That would be Awesome.

https://t.co/XRf4UzrURqUgly lost @warriors … pathetic effort defensively and undisciplined as evident by the amount of silly turnovers… 18, 16 &amp; 20 point quarters in the NBA will not win many games! Utah didn’t play that great of defense they simply displayed bigger effort they out hustled the DubsNah I don’t give a shit if Lakers lost today, the Golden State Warriors lost to some nobody team, sink that in folks@warriors I can’t believe that Steph even had 16 points. I swear that I only recall hitting one 3, and then a little bankshot from right side@ali_mohamed77 @solomon_tech @warriors Jokic would have a field day with Looney keep thinking Warriors don’t need a center@30formvp @ProphNYK @warriors @Suns No way Warriors hang with a team that's as deep at the 5 as the Suns are for an entire series😂@PierreP724 @warriors Steph is GARBAGE right now.NBA Defensive GOAT?!

IF YOU KEEP PLAYING LIKE YOUR GET IN THE BAG, ??@warriors Dub coaching is great if they have a "ready-made team" they haven't proven themselves otherwise.

Tomorrow it's home court Don't dissapoint. 🙏💛💛@BayAreaSportsF7 @warriors Yeah it’s on Kerr idiot he literally said he’s playing Steph as a playmaker and not gonna get as many shots or be as involved in scoring that’s all on Kerr you think Curry can’t score 30 whenever he wants to it’s better than passing to players who can’t make layups@warriors Poor shooting nyt 4 d Dubs, they have a chance thou to bounce back against the Knicks I just hope Curry gets calls he deserves. He was fouled on his last shot ☹@BayAreaSportsF7 @NotChasingWins @warriors I’ll admit lee is unplayable and jta is ok but he hasn’t had a good game in a long time but we a need a big rn. Looney is good but we can’t have him playing 82 games he needs to rest@sftheletters @warriors Looney is the starting centre for the other minutes, you don’t need another centre, Looney understands the Kerr system and how to play with Steph and Klay, he played that role in the 2019 finals.@KawhitoLeonard @warriors @NBCSAuthentic Lee and Bjelica when the team already winning by 35 https://t.co/mUIQPVzvnR@ProphNYK @warriors Now, faced with facts, you wanna pretend it's all about his defense! 😆 Grow up.

It was a bad loss. They had a bad night. But they have the SECOND BEST RECORD IN THE LEAGUE! After missing the playoffs for two straight seasons. How many of you thought that would be the case before the season started? Not me…@Mathketball1 @warriors U already know we ain’t doing shit no need for false hope 🥲@dayne_876 @warriors The only centre coming is the #2 pick in the draft, it’s he’s job to lessen the load on Looney leading up to the playoffs, next season keep Looney, get better big than Bjelica and develop Wiseman.Encerrado:

Lee. Bro played 27 minutes for 3 points. That's 3 points more than you and myself. Kerr has a passing fetish and Steph CHOOSES not to play on-ball. It's his decision whether to play on or off-ball.

#GoJazz #NBA@Huf4Huf @anthonyVslater @warriors @WarriorsPR It is better to rest a player when playing an Eastern conference opponent instead of a Western conference opponent. In my view it was a mistake. Perhaps the Warriors would not have one but their chances would’ve been much better.@RlpUchiha @warriors "Unserious team" is 41-14@warriors After tonight’s game, definitely not going to give this franchise anymore viewership until they straighten their sh*t up by getting a big man and getting rid of D Lee… this team is so portentous and overrated just like the Bay Area@warriors @NBCSAuthentic Did y'all win?@4bsmooth @NBAHistory @warriors Don't watch the ball watch the floor then you will see basketball differently.@Raven_lusica @warriors I know that but hadn't Lee played so much minutes like a starter we would have turned that around in the 3rd. We are talking about what rotations should be made right especially going into the playoffs. DLee is not going to help us out and you know that's a fact@Dave68452679 @warriors @utahjazz Shooting 35% won’t help you win many games. They snapped their own streak.@warriors Why rest Klay against Utah and play him against knicks🤔 idc if the plan was to play him at home but rest him against a team like Utah really????@solomon_tech @sftheletters @warriors not even that since kerr only gave him 14 minutes@DanielWAnthro @warriors And then what happened today@Reus11SZN @warriors Were winning because klay klay is playing@NadalCurryJaggi @warriors He shot 3 for 21, had the worst shooting slump of his career and got flamed by everyone@warriors We need Steph's numbers up again...there is no one else Dubs can rely on to consistently drop 30+ pts every game 😔😔@Lakers @warriors YOU SOLD 💔 https://t.co/rCkkafHZJ8@missionarymelo @warriors Full time fan at this point@warriors @JonathanKuming6 Kuminga scared the Shit out of Conley.@warriors Curry was pathetic today. I don't care that his efficiency was somewhat decent (though still below average). If your teammates are bricking, and you are the first option, you need to take over and start scoring. 

3 shots in the second half is unacceptable.@BayAreaSportsF7 @NotChasingWins @warriors No, delusional are for those people who could not stand aside their biases for a logical argument. If you think Steve Kerr is a great coach, fine, but those who rant about him as not as great as you see him, you have to respect that as long as its reasonable. #NBA #DubNation@warriors the mitchell effectThis longtime female @nba fan totally enjoyed the all-female broadcast crew on tonight's @ESPNNBA broadcast of the @utahjazz win over the @warriors!  @heydb @bethmowins @saltersl

They'll only get traded for a big time superstar which is unlikely@lancem69 @warriors Steve Kerr cannot manage a team@StorkEighty3 @Exauce96160799 @warriors @JonathanKuming6 What about trading him for a Subway gift card?@BurnerClarkson @warriors All good laugh now but when playoffs come y’all struggle every year 😂😂@warriors Too much passing and in need for a back up big but

Tell Stephen to play and take control of the game. He's the best player and he's playing like a role playerLebron for Clay Thompson and a few minor players,  do you say yes if you are Bob at @warriors ???@warriors thanks for the best winning streak in the league rn@warriors Lee ??????? 0 fuck points https://t.co/pnXv0w2GuP@BurnerClarkson @warriors Ratio then@warriors Man horrible performance by everyone, but 2/3 against the Utah ain’t bad, it is what it is, let’s move on and hopefully we win all/or almost all games before AllStar...Definitely gotta work on some things tho@ItsKasshh @missionarymelo @warriors Nah it’s because kerr is treating him like some spot up shooter.

Goodnight🥱@warriors @OnBallSteph Lee played 20+ minutes…@YC_0015 @warriors It ain't about wins or loses. Is how the team plays. The same mistakes keep on happening. JTA and Lee get worse by the minute yet they continue to play. No bigs, weird steph rotations, steph barely taking any shots, missing open layups and shots, careless TOs...@WisemanFan @warriors overall bad game from everyone@sftheletters @warriors A centre that we won’t play in the playoffs, Warriors will play small ball lineups come playoffs with Draymond at the 5, Looney will have the other minutes.@warriors Embarrassing@BurnerClarkson @warriors 5-3 from field seems pretty good to me@warriors trade damion lee for cash considerations@NBA @warriors @utahjazz I love Doris on play-by-play.

Isn’t he supposed to be a person who can hit 3’s lol he’s bricking everything@warriors Toscano and Kuminga in garbage time 🔥🔥🔥 https://t.co/Q9IP2QjLDs@warriors Dude I'm tired of Steph not handling the ball, this L was coming considering how sloppy and bad we played. But Steph have to take more than 13 shots dude averaged 32 a year ago.@warriors please trade damion lee@PierreP724 @warriors How is this on Kerr? Explain. This game is Stephen Curry lol.

Classic Kerr isn't a good coach because of a regular-season loss to Utah lol.  Y'all are wild. And Kerr is easily a top 15 HC.@missionarymelo @warriors He have more scorers so his scoring won’t always be like that every game. , but I agree we need the fun Steph curry back@warriors I don’t imagine a contender team where Lee, JTA and Bjelicia get minutes in playoff games, they are killing the Warriors rotation and Warriors culture, Lee only play in Warriors cuz Steph want his sister closer to him as simple as that. ALL DUB NATION HATE @Dami0nLee@warriors People (For the real fans) before we start getting blinded by being mad😂let’s not forget we had a 9 win straight run, and also we weren’t gonna win the whole 3 games against Utah, especially not without Klay and playing like this...Hopefully we win the next games before AllStar@currybuu @warriors This.

We need a center.@warriors Warriors need to trade @StephenCurry30 to @Lakers in exchange to @KingJames. Warriors can't take his Slump anymore...The @utahjazz extend their win streak to four, and snapped the @warriors unbeaten streak at 9. 

Donovan Mitchell falls just shy of a triple double with 14 points, 10 rebounds, and 8 assists. 

#TakeNote

But this is not the real Golden State #Warriors

#NBA #GSWvsUTA@warriors LMFAOOOOOOOOOO WARRIORS LOST@warriors It’s all good@warriors Would Damion Lee be taking up a roster spot if he wasn't Steph Curry's brother-in-law? Seems like a big man (a Tristan Thompson veteran type maybe) to add some depth down low would be more useful.@warriors Bounce back time@warriors The way Steph played tonight was awful, not being aggressive and not being a leader out there too

When Lee is bad, he is BAD. Idk why he got starter minutes tonight.@warriors I'll say it. This Stephen Curry is not fun to watch. This is a game where he needed to takeover and he out there playing like Duncan Robinson. Disgusting behavior from someone who just averaged 30ppg a year ago lmao@warriors This is a no brainier. https://t.co/S62cFg0exeback at it tomorrow https://t.co/gOyQqiGrOm@dale_fourtwenty @tianchris7120 @steph_burner @MeisterTuchel @GoIdenState @StephenCurry30 @KlayThompson @Money23Green @warriors @SteveKerr He's averaging 8 on 38% shooting from 3.

Ah well. Home tomorrow against the Knicks. Nice little rebound game.

#GoldenStateWarriorsNo solid center, no chip. That's a straight fact. Dubs can't win thru small-ball all the time. They even lack energy at times.

WAKE UP @SteveKerr @warriors, TRADE IS A MUST.@Moses_moods @nogueirasn1 @Mickeyy_mickk @youkapalot @warriors @JonathanKuming6 Get rid of Wiseman, Looney, Lee for a real C. I just feel like a Wiseman is a dime a dozen in the league. What was his stats 11 &amp; 5, nothing special.ESPN is advertising the shit out of Lakers vs Golden State on Saturday. LeBron vs Steph. 

But the Lakers just lost to the blown up Trailblazers and the Warriors are going to lose by 25 to the Jazz. Lol@warriorsvox Any @warriors color edition preferably with DLee wearing street clothes. 😎Dress like the Knicks get beat like the Knicks @warriors@Carlsimz @warriors No scape goat this time. To a team that traded all its good players😂And just like that, our chance to have a 10-game winning streak is out the window. Bawi na lang tayo bukas, @warriors 💪Don't let it fool you. The Jazz held Golden State Warrior's to under 60 points in 3 Quarters. (Well 1 min left)

That's good defence@warriors @JonathanKuming6 by the 3rd quarter the Jazz get the bonus early. The refs hmmmmbounceback @warriors.@warriors get turner man, he wants out &amp; we need a big lolplease do something tomorrow. @warriors@raiderman94 @warriors @JonathanKuming6 I’m sure you are lakers fanHey @ABCNetwork @ESPNNBA don’t play the @Lakers vs @warriors SATURDAY!!!

In my view: Kerr screwed up big-time and this loss is all on him and his poor decision not to play Thompson @warriors @WarriorsPR he needs to explain this decision and I hope you press him hard on it. It’s your job.One of the worest performance from the @warriors this season.... come on #DubNation we are the #Warriors we can do anything whenever we want.....All you lot had to do was make it competitive @warriors dickheads@famouslos32 @warriors take notice you bumsCall @JeanieBuss , you've still got time!

I just trust in our big three enough for us to mask that weaknessLet's start another winning streak @warriorsI've said this several times, and I will say it again: @warriors will have a problem winning and closing road games in the playoffs. Their young lads do great at home but are ineffective on the road. Well, maybe Steve Kerr will use limited rooster &amp; let the vets do the job.@warriors announce lebron@warriors really want to spoil my morningFuck the @warriors https://t.co/abXMHUNixa@CHRISPL79266739 @warriors @JonathanKuming6 He already said he is not looking at doing it. Stupid. Will cost them in the end. Even with Wiseman.Holy shit @warriors what happened in the 2nd half? it was like watching a NCAA team take on an NBA team. There was zero confidence in any shot creation. If they play zone, all you're gonna do is commit turnovers when you pass it 11 times in 24 seconds. Come on@TIceTice416 @Raptors @warriors Yeah @utahjazz clearly outplaying @warriorsLIKE FUCKING DO SOMETHING @warriors this unacceptable if your not gonna give him the touches he should be getting send him back to the g league this dude can be getting 20 points but instead is just on the floor like they are playing with 4 players 

Updated; not 2-3 5 points https://t.co/jX7dYi4jou@Moses_moods @nogueirasn1 @Mickeyy_mickk @youkapalot @warriors @JonathanKuming6 I still think we need a C…the suns are dominating right now. They’re a different team now then at the beginning of the season. We don’t know what Wiseman we getting back…sorry@WHAAAT_EK @warriors Gonna be tough with him ramping up I know he barely gonna play B2B but shoot we need 10 and 8RB and we good lolThis game is barfaroni 🤢

#LakeShow https://t.co/l7lj4uHQ1xMas e o nosso Golden State Warriors, hein? https://t.co/1K0o3XvZPL@warriors @JonathanKuming6 How many field goals did DAMION LEE made??????Warriors beat the Jazz with Gobert. Size is a concern but they’ve beaten teams with size. The issue is if just one of the big 3 for golden state plays it’s not a game they’ll win. Dray and Steph can win most games. Klay and Steph. It takes at least 2 of them or we’re 2020 again.@Jbhere4ya @nogueirasn1 @Mickeyy_mickk @youkapalot @warriors @JonathanKuming6 Also, it’s an off night bro. WE BEAT THE SUNS TWICE WITHOUT KLAY. We’re 41-13 without the big three, and wiseman will help the problems. It won’t make us perfect, but not all teams are perfect@anthonyVslater @warriors need to trade lee and GTA fo a big man to help Looney. Anyway we have so many guards so trade lee period......😤😤😤Racism won today. Shame on you @warriors@warriors @JonathanKuming6 Bro at some point I want this dude Curry to start Shooting hella more shots fucking ridiculous he should at least take 18-19 today he was playing like a pussysign a big man please @warriors@warriors @JonathanKuming6 Create another Winning streak keep going into the next one.

We ain't gonna do nothing with the likes of Lee, Beli, and JTA come playoffs. Trade these bums for a freaking center! Bob Myers do something please! It's getting annoying AF!@tianchris7120 @steph_burner @MeisterTuchel @GoIdenState @StephenCurry30 @KlayThompson @Money23Green @warriors @SteveKerr DLee Is a very good player and the fact that GS fans hate him for some reason is appalling to me.@Mickeyy_mickk @youkapalot @warriors @JonathanKuming6 Everyone sees what the problem is and GS fails to address it. We are Waiting for Wiseman. He will not be the savior, not this year. Less than 24 hours trade deadline or 2way player. Those are their only options otherwise hard to see them coming out of the West.@warriors He needs to get his act together.. we ain’t watching him because he building muscles… he has to start shooting the ball better!@Jbhere4ya @nogueirasn1 @Mickeyy_mickk @youkapalot @warriors @JonathanKuming6 Nah not you, I meant the guy saying we needed KD@warriors @JonathanKuming6 Still think Lee got be traded away. There are too many moments which drive me crazy.@warriors @JonathanKuming6 Please get rid of D Lee… no one should get special exceptions because they’re the brother-in-law of the teams star player https://t.co/hm9SgxrDGF@riccssss @warriors @JonathanKuming6 Cuz he a quitter@warriors @JonathanKuming6 Meanwhile Warriors losing streaks start now 🙄 This game so disappointed 🥺 https://t.co/koqNf4O4bB@warriors @JonathanKuming6 10th straight win is GONE.. :(@soakssss @Tezysama @dqmayne @Mickeyy_mickk @youkapalot @warriors @JonathanKuming6 hopefully they disable it before u go to prison for sending children dick picsI don’t care if we lose when we just aren’t playing well. But making terrible decisions on offense with no effort on defense is unforgivable. Be better tomorrow @warriors @StephenCurry30 #DubNation https://t.co/qX339IZXZWWelp. @warriors blown out by Jazz. At least Lakers losing.@lakers @warriors y’all just sold a bag frWe need a big guy to back up LoonGod out there, got any ideas? @warriors@tbuss32 Took over #GoldenStateWarriors vs #utahjazz  they go 14-52 and cant hit the oceanreally @utahjazz ? your starting line up still in the court 🤣🤣🤣🤣

But reality check every time dlee comes in, the positive becomes negative you should know that.I swear @warriors fans react every loss like its life and death.

Y'all are CRAZY as FUCK. It's not Kerr's fault Steph sucks every other day lol.@warriors Love the team, but I wish they could find a way to stop the sloppy, sloppy passing &amp; the poor ball handling.  NUMER ONE: take care of the ball.  When the 3's are not falling, it is time to shoot 2's &amp; go hard to the basket.  Hard to watch a great team play poorly.@warriors y’all niggas is rigging the game. @StephenCurry30 the greatest shooter of all time shoots 1 shot in the 3rd quarter.@Mickeyy_mickk @youkapalot @warriors @JonathanKuming6 It’s one fucking game holy shit.

Think the warriors need to make some type of addition if they want that chip #DubNation@Mickeyy_mickk @Moses_moods @youkapalot @warriors @JonathanKuming6 Wth that gotta do with rebounds and no interior defense? Y’all think Wiseman is going to solve that? We don’t even know how he’s going to be after the injury and Looney slow as hell. We need a C and that’s going to be the downside in the playoffs.

You should have rest him vs Okc and play in JAZZ 🤦🤦🤦🤦

team looks 🤡🤡🤡 right now! Jazz cooking them 🤡🤡🤡 @warriors @StephenCurry30 @KlayThompson @anthonyVslater@warriors Now unwatchable. Just chucking up poor shots and running backwards. May not even score 80 tonight.@soakssss @dqmayne @Mickeyy_mickk @youkapalot @warriors @JonathanKuming6 no, because of the fact u want to send little girls pictures of youre microscopic penisThe @utahjazz exploited the "only vulnerable" spot of the @warriors defence (rim protection) and offence (rebs)! Thus indicating the need of @Money23Green and @BigTicket_JW for the playoffs! 

So, the "only" key for @warriors winning the chip seems to be a complete healthy roster@Mickeyy_mickk @Jbhere4ya @youkapalot @warriors @JonathanKuming6 It’s ONE FUCKING GAME. Do u not know in 2016 one of our 9 losses were AGAINST THE LAKERS? These kinds of shit happens during the regular and y’all act so surprised FFS🤦@NBA @warriors @utahjazz This is a gimmick and it’s insulting to the women involved, imo@warriors @JonathanKuming6 When is Draymond back?Awts @warriors@warriors @JonathanKuming6 Were missing quite a few key players not worried.@warriors @NBCSAuthentic were losingStay up till 6am to watch you @warriors guys stink it up, absolute clowns@warriors @JonathanKuming6 hassan is rim rockin us (possible pause)@MrAmazing3 @warriors @JonathanKuming6 It’s every game , dude is careless with the passes , he turns it over the most tryna be flashy all the timeI think the @warriors have waived the white flag hereLet the @warriors  see the @utahjazz  in the playoffs! Warriors in 5 #NakeTote@anthonyVslater @MontePooleNBCS @WarriorsPR @Con_Chron @warriors @NBCSWarriors Course there’s no way to prove that the Warriors would’ve won tonight for sure but the chances would’ve been much better had Klay played. Kerr blew it @SteveKerrIt’s looking like I’m gonna be eating my own words rn… @warriors going out pathetic smh @Suns are clearly the better teamYou guys suck @warriors@warriors @NBCSAuthentic Get a damn big man!! Almost every loss we have is because of being undersized and a lack of presence in the paint…this is a good loss so Bob Myers can trade or sign a big man. Great job @warriorsSo @warriors if you don’t make it to the Finals or WCF it will solely be because of Steve Kerr . This bum makes no adjustments can’t get @StephenCurry30 looks even when he playing off ball . He treats Steph like he’s the 10th man on the bench not a MVP. https://t.co/ag9owsWtnXWarriors 3rd Quarter 57-55 Quin Snyder takes timeout , 67-90...kerr top 15🤡 #GoldenStateWarriors@soakssss @dqmayne @Mickeyy_mickk @youkapalot @warriors @JonathanKuming6 yea, tons of people that should be in prison@morky23 @warriors @JonathanKuming6 Because they want to give the Chase Center patrons a win tomorrow.... you know, the people who are paying for the players salaries. They sold this game.I just needed golden state to lose by 7 and nah can’t even get that. @warriors bum ass bitches . I hope the team bus breaks down@horangyeollie @warriors Absolutely not. And to lose to Utah of all teams. Just embarrassing.Done watching... and that's a first.
@warriors #GSWvsUTAWin please :// @warriors@Jbhere4ya @Moses_moods @youkapalot @warriors @JonathanKuming6 Some of y’all ain’t really fans if you can’t admit when our team isn’t performing, we came out and had them down bad, then we let our defense slip and their offense heat up. Just because we are down two players doesn’t mean we should be getting railed by the Jazz??@kb1883 @youkapalot @Mickeyy_mickk @warriors @JonathanKuming6 1 game &gt; 54 games lmaoAND WHY PUT MOODY IN IF YOUR NOT GONNA GIVE HIM THE DAMN BALL LIKE WTF BRO CAN ACTUALLY HELP BUT NO ONE PASSES TO HIM ITS SO FUCKING ANNOYING DO BETTER @StephenCurry30 @warriors @GSWReddit@warriors @NBCSAuthentic @espn @957thegame @betwayusa Why is Klay not playing? Curry is the one that needs to be out of the game and Klay needs to be playing. WHATEVER!!!We look like a G-league team…. Hope @warriors are looking to upgrade a little before the deadline… also Steph has played well this year… it’s ok to admit it@warriors @JonathanKuming6 i dont wanna see this team lose.Watching the @warriors @utahjazz game and it’s an all female crew calling the game!

#DubNation@DommThomass @warriors warriors = lakers@warriors @NBCSAuthentic We need a center@warriors @NBCSAuthentic Lee and jta don’t deserve to be on this team and they’ll play playoffs mins soon https://t.co/KoWzDHY53J@warriors @NBCSAuthentic the weakest win streak of the season comes to an end. frauds getting exposed against a good team as usual@warriors @NBCSAuthentic SIGN ANOTHER CENTER AND TRADE D LEE ITS THAT SIMPLE@warriors @NBCSAuthentic Damion Lee is so bad pls waive him. 0 defense 0 offense (when team actually needs it)END 3Q: Jazz 79, Warriors 65. 

Golden State scored two baskets and eight total points over the final nine minutes of the third quarter.

#GSWvsUTA #NBA@warriors @NBCSAuthentic sit lee@GoIdenState @warriors Horrible defense, even worse offense with Looney running PG@warriors @NBCSAuthentic Lee sucks man@warriors @NBCSAuthentic get Lee out of the fucking game, wtf is that https://t.co/lANEus6BsGEND OF Q3: Warriors trail the Jazz, 79-65. Golden State really needs to figure things out offensively to have a chance tonight. It has nearly as many turnovers (9) as assists (13).This is an ugly game for the @warriors - close enough to come back and win, but the Jazz have size and toughness that make it seem unlikely GSW is going to find that next gear@warriors @NBCSAuthentic bay sleepyBig quarter from the @utajazz who take a 79-65 lead over the @warriors. 

Trent Forrest has been instrumental in the Jazz success. 

He has 11 points, 3 rebounds, and 3 assists.

Arguably the stablest winning condition in SEA joining an established team that is explosive &amp; creative with an experienced coach. 

Isn't this exactly Kevin Durant + GSW? 😱@warriors do y’all even know how to play basketball@gogobobo711 @warriors go small but theyre rebounnding everything. geniusYou're calling ticky-tac fouls on the @Warriors and NO fouls on the Jazz. Fcking cheaters. @OfficialNBARefs
