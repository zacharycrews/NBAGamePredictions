Brooks was signed to a 10 day contract after DJ Wilson's 10 day expired.  They were taking up the last roster spot.  Brooks re-signing to a 2 year deal doesn't change the roster count.No stylist 🎶 https://t.co/K4YTI7ZbDD@zbond19 @SwipaCam @Raptors @cavs @nuggets That's a defeatist mentality. Even if they have better overall teams right now, that's still no excuse to lose to a team like the @okcthunder at home. I was merely agreeing with you on Jokic, and those losses affect Denver's seeding, and in turn, Jokic's chances at MVP.#NBA,

It's nice to see them all right there when I check in on my Twitter profile 💙

As always, MomentNerd creating great tools for the community. Respect 🤝 https://t.co/UoO2g1gIlW@faithswelcome @Raptors Yes and raps fans are hyping him up as this shooter and he’s shooting 30% from the field and 29% on 3s lmao that’s worse than Svi and Yuta… idk I’m just not a fan of Nurse, he’s not a competent coach in my opinion but still hoping Svi will get waived to get a better opportunityTORONTO -- The Toronto Raptors announced today they've signed Armoni Brooks to a multi-year deal
As per team policy, terms are not available. https://t.co/pIJuOpCopW@jasbloom1998 @Raptors Exactly! I'm like why did Brooks get 2 years deal? He only played for 3 games!  I'm just annoyed. Still on svi and yuta island lmao and I'm still gonna complain@faithswelcome @Raptors Makes me so mad and then he brings Brooks in and gives him a legitimate shot over both when they both played well at the beginning of the season and only struggled forreal when the team was depleted! But again I’m the one of the only people still on Svi island lmaoVery happy to see Armoni Brooks find a new home with the Toronto Raptors. Glad he is helping them. Keep winning, guys! https://t.co/PyXLON76rj@ScarboroBruh @Raptors905 @Raptors @JusChampagnie Im guessing raptors are just developing him in g league since raptors are a play-in/play-off team this season@jasbloom1998 @Raptors It just sucks cause I wanna root for both of them. They play good and he's just not using them and I hate him for it@nbagleague @Raptors905 Makes you wonder why @Raptors don’t give him minutes.@Raptors rookie #ScottieBarnes has no idea where to get braids done in #Toronto https://t.co/2UMtgGje55@faithswelcome @Raptors Nurse is single handily ruining both players!

Thank You@Sportsnet @Raptors Please leave this Brother alone, I know its a valid question but ya'll this one alone. He can win a chip@Sportsnet @Raptors Just talking to talk

I ain't doing this to GT@vridozXBL @Raptors905 @Raptors @JusChampagnie If he got balance like that what is holding him back?  I am just talking about the obvious gift of balance@Armentro1Landon @NBA @IcyScottieV2 @Raptors So it only counts when we're injured and you're not?@RockNRollHoops @CelticsBBall17 @JoeyGBos @StoolGreenie Correct, but Kyrie can’t play in toronto so KD vs the raptors.@Sportsnet @Raptors I feel like this trade hasn’t aged well for Portland…🤫The @trailblazers made a season low 3 3-pointers tonight vs. the @HoustonRockets ...but it's not their worst ever.
The Blazers went 0-20 beyond the arc vs. the @Raptors in 2012...and still won 92-74 #RipCity@Raptors905 @Raptors @JusChampagnie That pic

Work on that, that balance@_NFTClubhouse @nbatopshot Toronto raptors@zbond19 @SwipaCam Exactly. That's why every game matters. Losing to the @okcthunder cannot happen. Collapsing in the fourth quarter to the @Raptors cannot happen. Choking to the @cavs cannot happen. If the @nuggets won those games, Jokic would be firmly in the #1 spot. Winning matters.@TaroFinch @Sportsnet @Raptors Still young, he will learn.@DC_709 @TaroFinch @Sportsnet @Raptors Trent Jr is a bad shot maker.@TiWindisch it looks to me like the Bucks would be better off as the 1 or 3 seed. 2 seed likely faces the Nets in round 1.
Raptors aren't no joke though. 1 game playoff for the Nets at Toronto won't be easy. 
Bucks in a 7 game series with all our bigs will be tough on the Nets tho.Tonight @Pacers vs @Raptors #WeTheNorth@SiakamSpinV2 @Raptors We're gonna take a 6'8 forward who can't shoot from ZambiaCaleb Love projected early 2nd rounded I am here @RaptorsJust found out @zach_edey is Canadian, @Raptors you know what to do@ScarboroBruh @Raptors905 @Raptors @JusChampagnie He got a contract b4, respect on his name@wensparks @Raptors Whos your son?RT: Raptors: RT @Raptors905: THE ROOK WENT OFF TONIGHT 🔥 @JusChampagnie

How do you become an OG hater@Raptors @ScottBarnes561 Year*@IsiahThomas @DetroitPistons I was a fan of the Bad Boys in the 80s, and also appreciate the role you played in bringing the Raptors to Toronto 👏🏽👏🏽Just returning from a University tour, sitting in the back seat of our new MYP. I’m so impressed with this vehicle. Driving to Toronto Raptors game tomorrow and Canada - Jamaica game Sunday at BMO field. Addicted to this car. https://t.co/JC1XpHl1Mg@blogTO @ScottBarnes561 @Raptors Brqzycuts on st.clairHello @Raptors I’m in T.O. to attend the @EasterSealsON @Rogers #ConnSmytheSportsCelebritiesDinnerandAuction on April 6 &amp; staying over. I’d love to go to your game against the @sixers the next day. I can’t find any ♿️ seating. I had a blast at my 1st game last week. Can you help? https://t.co/aauGGUwiAh@DC_709 @TaroFinch @Sportsnet @Raptors Both players have their advantages. The biggest win for the Raptors is that Gary is younger and cheaper so it was a good trade. But head to head the players are well matched.That’s a wrap! 👍

Thank you @UofT, @Raptors, @MLSEFoundation, and #TCHC staff and youth for an amazing #MBL launch event. See you next month when the ’22 season officially begins! https://t.co/RB37wLQRU9@NBA @Raptors @cavs BARNES ROY.@Sportsnet @Raptors A+  I love Norm but the Taps couldn’t keep him. They turned a few months of Jorm for a younger, super talented player. Great trade!!!@blogTO @ScottBarnes561 @Raptors https://t.co/cxlxS0Jg0h is really good and she's located downtown Toronto.  She'll hook him up nicely 👌🏾.@worldmeetjohn @Raptors I’ve said that it seems to me Pascal Siakam is a player that needs to be playing in front of a packed stadium he just needs that energy@MoneyVet @Raptors @CanadaSoccerEN @CanMNTUniverse @FirstNameConor That masked man is none other than Carter!

trust me, I’m a loyal Day 1 @Raptors fan…but have to say this is dope! 🔥💯 https://t.co/H3ur81OuDy@Phoenix7863 @Sportsnet @Raptors I’m a big Norm fan too. I loved him in Toronto and he contributed to our Championship. He’s got a chance to compete for another when/if Kawhi and PG can get and stay healthy.This is awesome  🏀 @Raptors ! https://t.co/KzDVeYjfFF@wensparks @Raptors when i can’t watch the game… I track the game on the Raptors App! tells you play by play@TaroFinch @Sportsnet @Raptors See that but still young and can adjust.@Phoenix7863 @Sportsnet @Raptors I agree that Norm is probably the better defender now. He’s also 6 years older than GTJ and has 4 more years in the league. GTJ has shown significant growth this year on the defensive end. This season GTJ is tied for 5th in steals (1.8) and 4th in deflections per game (3.6).@paxer89 As a Toronto Raptor fan I was wondering if you happen to know what happened with Jalen?@NBA2K 
Jalen Green 13 badges 
Mobley 10 badges
Cunningham 17 badges 

Barnes 4 badges….now y’all tell me what’s wrong with that- do y’all watch any games #NBA2K #raptors #Toronto  @Ronnie2K#TCHC Staff and #MBL alumni speak to youth about the program’s focus on healthy competition, physical literacy, and sportsmanship 💪

@UofT @Raptors @MLSEFoundation https://t.co/hVDUClXcW3@bball_evo I’m a Toronto Raptor fan and have been following Jalen in Italy hoping he might have a chance to make a return to the Raptors. What went wrong for Jalen with Cremona?@yyzsportsmedia Marty York - Raptors, Blue Jays, TSN, Soortset. Adam Seaborn - sports media stuff. Mark Hebsher, sports media, Toronto Sports. Gabe Morency - sports gambling on tv. Steve Kouleas - A person that should be in Ron MacLean’s spot. Andrew Chang - could probably do well hosting sportsHappy happy birthday Kyle @Klow7  🎉🎂🎉 Come home to Toronto @Raptors and this mama will bake you a cake 🎂👍 Stay blessed@HPbasketball *Puts on conspiracy theory hat* NBA doesn't want Raptors in 7th seed as Kyrie won't be able to play in Toronto....
