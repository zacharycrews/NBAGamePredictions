We don't play up hereLet’s see if I can bring the @Raptors some luck. Been off the tweets for a second #wethenorth@bam4dpoy @jadensmithsdad @RustyBUCKETS321 You're right, Steph is averaging 2.53 miles per game this season. 

The league leader is Raptors' Fred VanVleet (2.87).

 Did you know, Toronto has 3 of the top 7 guys in distance travelled per game among qualified players (VanVleet, Barnes, Anunoby)?Pascal Siakam and the @Raptors look to bounce back as they host the @nyknicks at Scotiabank Arena tonight.
