#GamblingTwitterWith Paul George coming back from an injury, the LA Clippers have a chance to get past the play-in. #nba #clippers #laclippers @ Los Angeles, California https://t.co/bjQrQGh1UzThe Utah Jazz head to Los Angeles to face the Clippers on Tuesday, and they could be without Rudy Gobert for the matchup. However, we think should back the Jazz with or without Gobert.
