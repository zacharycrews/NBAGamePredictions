Hopefully they can stay injury-free and keep up the intensity that they had last year.@36thHarrumph @nyknicks I agree! Much cleaner and simpler@NBA_NewYork I like Jalen he just trolls sometimes.  Wilbon’s fine, minus some blowhard takes.  Stephen A is a character.  Didn’t get as pissed at the spike stuff as much as other Knicks fans.  And as long as mark jackson isn’t coaching the Knicks he’s fineThe New York Knicks open up their season tonight against the Boston Celtics looking to build on a playoff appearance from last year!

However...it does give the Knicks a bit of an out on defense. I bet Boston plays small a lot, as New York tends to play two bigs. That forces Randle or another big to pick up Tatum or Brown on the perimeter.@nicoleeejets @nyknicks Lol petty 
I love it 🧡💙“New York we HERE” @J30_RANDLE

Especially former Celtics Kemba Walker. I'm expecting strong defense from the Knicks because that's what Tabs was hired for. #NBA75@hannibalsekt0r @NewsFallon @nyknicks Realistically, a championship is the ceiling.

Realistically, a 2nd round exit is most likely.In the last four seasons that the Knicks made the playoffs, they held a lead at halftime in their opening game. 

Safe to assume if the Knicks have a lead at half tonight they will make the yoffs
