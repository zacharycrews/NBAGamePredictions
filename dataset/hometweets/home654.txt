1️⃣Mavs/Thunder u210.5 (-110)

-The total has gone UNDER in 5 of Dallas's last 5 games at home. 

-Mavericks &amp; Thunder have played each other twice this year and in both games under 200 total points were scored. I’m giving to ride this trend. 

#GamblingTwitter https://t.co/2ISWgZWZS2Weird trend, but the Dallas Mavericks are 1-9 O/U this season in the second game of a home stand. Are you rocking with the Mavs and ThUNDER to go Under again tonight?
