May God comfort your family.I had lunch once with Frank Layden (former Utah Jazz Coach) and he shared this exact quote with me. It had an impact. In your sport or your job are you coachable? Are you flexible? Adaptable?Could you do more than just, “what you are told?” There is power in being proactive. https://t.co/ZaWoTiqCN954° Jogo - Golden State Warriors 89 x 100 Utah Jazz

#TakeNote #NBA https://t.co/LY8Djes5OX@tatatatyler @conradburry @UniWatch yes, I managed to put that together myself.

the big difference is you're comparing the Utah Jazz—when's that HBO show coming out?—&amp; the Los Angeles Lakers. so you've got 12 championships, of their 17 total, won in LA to0⃣.

the Jazz legacy is Malone, Stockton, &amp;... Mormon jazz??@Grrr22 @rudygobert27 @spidadmitchell @utahjazz So sorry for your loss 🙏@YoYo_YoYo_Yoo @conradburry @UniWatch Oh I’m just saying if Utah Jazz doesn’t make sense, neither does LA Lakers.@utahjazz @WasatchFord Come and eat as much as you want eating unhealthy foods that will clog your arteries while you watch some of the fittest athletes in the country compete, the irony of professional sports@Grrr22 @JordanClarksons @spidadmitchell @rudygobert27 @mconley11 @utahjazz @youngwhiteside So sad!
