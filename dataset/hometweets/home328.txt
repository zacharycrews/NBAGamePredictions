You must be new around here... @raptors @olgproline @NBACanada@pyretechic @rodrigue700 @GSWRevengeTour @Raptors His team might have the better record but the talent around Scottie is way higher than the cavs. Three players putting up near all-star numbers, and 5 players averaging 15+, the most in the league. We lose cause of our lack of interior D (no big man), injuries, and our bench.@pyretechic @IcyScottieV2 @GSWRevengeTour @Raptors Scottie is still putting up better stats and there’s only a 3 game difference between the raptand the cavs that can change in a week and the raptors have been playing without their best player, starting shooting guard and best center@IcyScottieV2 @rodrigue700 @GSWRevengeTour @Raptors Ok how does that change that Evan Mobley is putting up near similar stats on a better team.Analyzing Thursday’s Milwaukee Bucks at Toronto Raptors odds and lines, with NBA expert picks, predictions and best bets.  https://t.co/DNvTZmn1Tm@Raptors FACTSMilwaukee Bucks at Toronto Raptors odds, picks and prediction https://t.co/tFUQNSIUyV@Raptors @The888J I care, you're clearly just drawing a paycheck.

🏀: @Bucks vs. @Raptors 
📺: TSN
🕢: 7:30 PM/ET

https://t.co/9hDEMpowX6@DanielMutton3 @itsmygame @Raptors Svi needs more confidence. Malachi needs to be an offensive threat. Siakam needs to get his matchups and stop missing the layup/fade away. And the rest of the bench needs 3-point practice until their elbows give out. That load needs to come off FVV.Making my sports debut in the Toronto Star debut. In my first piece, I talk to  @Raptors @superfan_nav about his new @cbcdocs where he tells me about the struggles he faced coming to Canada and opens up about his marriage for the first time. https://t.co/BVWuRlbEMgToronto Raptors e Milwaukee Bucks se encontram pela NBA nessa noite 🏀🏆 https://t.co/USEEhGm8ob@DanielMutton3 @itsmygame @Raptors I feel like so much is spent on defense that we have bad offense, which results in quick runs against offences with more efficient scoring percentages. Great defense works better when you have certain scorers. Kawhi can score. Ibaka can score.Through his partnership with the Toronto Raptors, Nav has used his love for basketball to create positive change for youth and minorities across the globe. Watching his journey has been inspirational for all Canadians, especially newcomers.@KingGamerBois1 @itsmygame @Raptors I hope you’re right. They came out ablazin in the beginning of the season, almost too hot. Injury management comes from limiting minutes and strengthening your bench. Your bench has to be able to go toe to toe with a starting lineup. Then we talk playoffs.@STR0 The NBA fined the Raptors because Drake tried to recruit KD to Toronto some years ago, during a concert where Durant was in the audience. And Drake don't even play for the team.
What Stro did was tampering, he should know better.@Raptors @TangerineHoops They gave it a good try, but came up short ( saving you time for the headlines later)🤣Arrived this morning 😍😍😍😍😍🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥💯💯💯💯💯💯 @gtrentjr @Raptors #33 #GTJ #WeTheNorth https://t.co/LG3ol7Bj4JNBA Betting Preview: Milwaukee Bucks vs. Toronto Raptors https://t.co/5EjMbvsGYBWe celebrated Nav Bhatia last night with Prime Minister @JustinTrudeau at the Ottawa premiere of his documentary #Superfan.

Pick #1 NBA Toronto Raptors +4.5(-110)
Pick #2 CBB Northern Kentucky +3.5(-110)A powerful part of the film is the connection between Bhatia finding success as a new Canadian and the 25-year journey for the Toronto Raptors to become NBA champions.

#cdnpoli #onpoli #leafs #Toronto @fordnation #Raptors https://t.co/RsCRqiWF7r@yaboyipso @NBACanada @ScottBarnes561 @Raptors The Raps, which seem to be going nowhere this year, should have Scottie taking the 5th most shots? 

OG 17.7
Fred 16.2
Trent 14.7
Siakam 14.4
Scottie 12.9
Achiuwa 8.7

If we arent going anywhere, we should be showcasing the young guys. And giving them more opportunities &amp; minutesThe Toronto Raptors are now 9-13.

Scottie Barnes can shoot threes though, so that's something.

#WeTheNorthSome #NBATwitter thoughts..

• Can someone go free Brandon Ingram?
• Hornets need Myles Turner, but who/what can they trade that the Pacers actually want?
• Drake (Raptors ambassador) was in OKC recruiting his fellow Toronto mans SGA. Masai, I see you!
• Lamelo.@yaboyipso @NBACanada @ScottBarnes561 @Raptors No Scottie doesnt need 30 shots, but when he is shooting almost 49% he should be getting more touches. Not just put back layups. Pascal is at 46%, Fred @ 44% and Trent at 43%. Scottie needs to be a bigger part of the offense, but that wont happen until at least 1 of them are gonePros and Cons of the Toronto Raptors tanking for a star in 2022 – NBA News https://t.co/2LvX4iAWqb@_moon_artist_ @Leon_Riedel98 @eNFTsaid @RyanHodge @JaValeMcGee @Cryptoon_Goonz @Raptors I spent a summer in Rockford, IL while in college, that entire town has a vibe.

https://t.co/AHPLuUhmEa@Raptors No Chemistry.@MMattredfield @Raptors Welcome!!An honour to attend the Ottawa Premiere of @superfan_nav’s documentary at the National Arts Centre.

Through his undying love for the @Raptors, Nav has been a true champion for diversity and inclusion in sport, and represents the best of Canada. https://t.co/ZJp7VNI7AgDefending the Toronto Raptors has never been more simple. On Fred VanVleet getting the 'Steph Curry' treatment and why the Raptors could well see more of it: https://t.co/yt8NNwyJeT@JimKarasBoxing @Tristan21r @mandi_andi @SiakamFan @Raptors That’s a great graphic! 
I don’t see GSW giving up Wiggins though. And I’m still not convinced of trading pascal.@Raptors @TangerineHoops Welcome back,got em@MMattredfield @Raptors Great. Tell them they need a centre, not some guy who is 6'8 pretending to be a center.@criptocotton @rebelreseller @LaLigaOnFlow #TorontoRaptors can still be your squad!  Speaking of, I watch this every few weeks when I need a pick me up. One of my favorite highlight clips when Kawhi put them on their back. Wait until the last shot..... 

https://t.co/ciuNXRsQS4Say hello to the Raptors Superfan Nav Bhatia. He has attended almost every single Toronto Raptors home game since the team's first season in 1995. #superfan #cbcdocumentary #raptors https://t.co/sEELsv7PNt@repoocrelyt @NBACanada @ScottBarnes561 @Raptors Well the cool thing about the raptors team is our leading scorer only averages around 20 ppg so I absolutely believe Scottie could do that. Sure defenses will adjust and make it harder for him, but the leap from roughly 16 to 20 doesn’t feel that insane@MMattredfield @saj1191 @Raptors 😂😂😂 congratulations on your new role𝐅𝐫𝐞𝐝 𝐕𝐚𝐧𝐕𝐥𝐞𝐞𝐭'𝐬 𝐍𝐨𝐯𝐞𝐦𝐛𝐞𝐫 𝐒𝐭𝐚𝐭𝐬:
