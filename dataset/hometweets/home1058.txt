Scoring - Embiid
Shooting Percentage - Jokic
Assists - Jokic
Rebounds - Jokic
Steals - Jokic
Blocks - Embiid
PER - Jokic

So, Jokic has none of the skills required. And, if they shot the same number if FTs per game, Jokic would have him in scoring as well but....@Cavs #Cavs did that guy on the broadcast last night end up eating 117 nuggets??@NkuliNdlovu3 @ESPNStatsInfo @cavs But did they win??@ESPNStatsInfo @cavs But they don't have one of the top young cores.Lauri made his mark in the victory over Denver!

#LetEmKnow | @Cavs https://t.co/tX4XcufU2sThe Cleveland Cavaliers play basketball tonight and are one game behind the fifth seed https://t.co/iolfXiB6Ha@embiidhomie @BogartBrandoMAV @NBA @cavs Jokic did what he always does, which was everything needed to win the game. It's what makes him better at offense. You think offense is all about one player scoring. That's fine for middle school basketball.@embiidhomie @BogartBrandoMAV @NBA @cavs He had a historic stats season last year and is even better this year with a weaker team. You really should watch for something other than that dunk or that block. That era of the NBA is dead.@embiidhomie @BogartBrandoMAV @NBA @cavs We'll see. Lol. Embiid has a small chance at getting the MVP if he stays healthy... Big if.@embiidhomie @BogartBrandoMAV @NBA @cavs Sure, yet...

The stats absolutely say something different, but whatever, keep watching with just your eyes when they name him the MVP again after shooting 58% or whatever insane number he'll end up with this year and having a stat line that hasn't been seen in 35 years.@LamarStevens11 Was hoping to go but I'll have to catch it from my TV:) let's go @cavs !!!!!@embiidhomie @BogartBrandoMAV @NBA @cavs I don't know. Jokic seems to gaurd him pretty well. Lol. Embiid is going to do what he wants down low. As is Jokic/Giannis. Still, you can't take 24 shots as a big in the NBA and only get fouled once (like last night). Sorry, it's just not possible.@RuiterWrongFAN @cavs Of all the pictures of the Cavs championship, why choose a pic with Jim Brown centered as your background? Judging from your article you are the master defender of women.  You wouldn‚Äôt be moving your goal posts would you???@embiidhomie @BogartBrandoMAV @NBA @cavs He's in the paint, and double and triple teamed all night. He suffers from not getting calls because he shoots at a high percentage and never gets that late whistle that a lot of stars get after the ball rims out.@cavs @dariusgarland22 He is such a blast to watch!@embiidhomie @BogartBrandoMAV @NBA @cavs You don't and your commentary makes that pretty obvious.@RuiterWrongFAN @cavs But Jim Brown is okay to be centered in your Twitter background? But you want to crucify Watson for not even being indicted? Brown went to trial cuz there was enough evidence to charge! https://t.co/cT3pG30cHA@embiidhomie @BogartBrandoMAV @NBA @cavs Numbers are context because there is a lot more happening on the court than that crazy slam dunk or block you saw. The Warriors are only a dynasty because someone smart started looking at advanced stats rather than flashy plays.@carlyteller @msshawnt @Browns @cavs can you get your husband to let vita vea through a couple times when they play the buccs?Denver Nuggets vs Cleveland Cavaliers Full Game Replay 2022 Mar 18 NBA Replay HD
https://t.co/PdJnQJeZU4 https://t.co/wUkuuqabuS@BogartBrandoMAV @embiidhomie @NBA @cavs There is no doubt that Embiid is bigger and stronger. He's just simply not better at offense and you're not going to find many NBA analysts outside of "always wrong" Nick Wright who thinks so. It's why he was MVP last year and will be again. It isn't because of his D.@embiidhomie @BogartBrandoMAV @NBA @cavs You might evaluate the actual stats and data before calling anyone "casual".@embiidhomie @BogartBrandoMAV @NBA @cavs Every stat besides FTs and Blocks. 

Embiid averages 5 more points per game purely from FTs, despite taking less shots and shooting 2pt shots at way lower percentage. 12.5% lower! You're crazy if you think Embiid is better at offense. There is no stat on earth to prove that.@ryanspradlin @embiidhomie @NBA @cavs Jokic does not play with anywhere near the same level of mobility or physicality@djstephfloss @cavs @nuggets How many did he end up with? Never showed the final amount at the game.@CavsSirCC @cavs Yes sir! https://t.co/OPEEsAAO3y@BradDaugherty43 @cavs Great photo Brad@Coach_DLOVE @cavs I stopped watching the game in the 3rd I'm salty lol@gadigol @cediosman @cavs Wondering the same thing@embiidhomie @BogartBrandoMAV @NBA @cavs Yawn...

There isn't a non player dictating assists. You do understand the rules right? FTs are awarded while assists are earned. Make sense? Do you think Bassey gets the same whistle as Lebron?

You obviously don't watch Jokic and/or anything outside of the Sixers. It's fine.@cavs @BallySportsCLE @wtam1100 @wmms @Power891 @RocketMortgage @isaacokoro303 @DetroitPistons @RMFieldHouse Need this win badly@djstephfloss @cavs @nuggets I need closure@djstephfloss @cavs @nuggets Did he finish? https://t.co/SajoQwX3AFüèÄ NBA Scoreboard üèÜ

Brooklyn Nets vs @sixers or against the Cleveland Cavaliers.‚Ä¶ https://t.co/0bO9kIjbo4@embiidhomie @BogartBrandoMAV @NBA @cavs But he isn't. The only thing he does better than Jokic, statistically, is get FTs. 

And yeah, I watch the both play. Do you? I like them both and they are both great but if you give Jokic the same whistle, it isn't even a contest. He's better is every other stat except blocks.@BogartBrandoMAV @embiidhomie @NBA @cavs I'm not sure if I'd call it complaining. Just pointing out that Embiid and Giannis both shoot about 6 more FTs per game despite handling the ball less, shooting less, and having lower shooting percentages.
