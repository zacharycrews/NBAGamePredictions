Jordan Nwora remains questionable, will be a game time decision.@BucksOwnYou @Bucks @MotorolaUS @Giannis_An34 Still needs to do a lot more to pass Tim Duncan, but ai believe he will be by the end of Giannis' career.#Brewers fan photos are not complete until you get the @Bucks fan at the @Brewers game. #FearTheDeer #WeAreAllOneTeam https://t.co/T7tBtjqwg7Milwaukee Bucks ML Game 1

$100,000 🔐  I don't mind laying juice in spots I believe the team is so far ahead of the other. This is what real value is not some stupid parlay, or massive plus dog.

I have https://t.co/ybfKwXCuxa and Sirius XM radio, so I see several Blue Jays games every year. Buck is awesome; one of the best. Hope his recovery is prompt and complete.@brianhwaters Hmmmmm. They’re the first seed in the East but the Milwaukee Bucks were the champs last season and they will be hard to beat. I’m going with no.. and even if Miami gets there, the best team in the entire league are the Phoenix Suns.@thegeorgetwo @Bucks This is your finest hourOur Jonah Freelander @JonahFreelander previews the  First Round series between the Milwaukee Bucks and the Chicago Bulls. #NBA #NBA75 #NBAPlayoffs

The one loss being the final game of last season when Giannis and all the starters where benched… Bucks in 4!!🧹🧹 https://t.co/5afaQnbesx@Bucks @betwayusa Will Grayson outscored Alex Caruso?Things you love to see PJ Tucker 4/4 3pts leading the miami Heat Scorers with 16pts against Atalanta hawks.....

(Packer fans will get the reference). No Quarter! 16 wins or bust! 

Go @Bucks!As @Bucks embark on their title defense, remember this @BillSimmons rule

"After your team wins a title, they immediately get a 5-year grace period: You can't complain about anything that happens (trades, draft picks, salary-cap cuts, coaching moves) for 5-years. No exceptions”@Bucks @TheLastKingdom I’m not even a basketball fan, but because of @TheLastKingdom I’ll be cheering for the @Bucks 🙌🏽 #destinyisallCan we count on Khris Middleton tonight? In the first 10 playoff games last season Middleton beat this number in 8 of them.
