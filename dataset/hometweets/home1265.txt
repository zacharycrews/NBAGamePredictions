#LEGENDoftheMiamiHEAT #NBA75The Miami Heat (-1.5) are up against the Atlanta Hawks (+1.5) at 7:00 PM EDT today.

80% of Shark Pick users are taking MIA (-1.5, -111) and 20% are taking ATL (+1.5, -109).

Who do you like?@BleacherReport Atlanta Hawks broke this man.  Hasn’t played in a game since.   They made him question everything about his mental health.  He wants no part of a basketball game.Ben simmons last game was game 7 of eastern conf 2nd round game were he was humiliated by the Atlanta hawks. He hasn't played for almost a year and yall expect Mr "My mental health is at stake here" to play in an elimination game against Boston? Lmao@wojespn Does this mean I, a fan of the Atlanta Hawks, have been more efficient then Ben Simmons has been for them? By not being on the Nets payroll?@ATLHawks @StateFarmArena @RoomsToGo Getting close to game time...Let's get it!!
#BelieveAtlanta@WonderJaye We can’t get swept today @ATLHawks@ATLHawks take care the business tonight  ........Get crunk onna sunday let do it👺 @ATLHawks https://t.co/bev8JEtobPThe baseball and soccer efforts today do not bode well for the @ATLHawksBREAKING: The @Braves &amp; Atlanta United have agreed to a trade with the city of Miami. The Braves &amp; Atlanta United games have been given to Miami in exchange for a @ATLHawks  win tonight against Miami with the score to be named later.@GAPhilterfish @Zouthern_Charm Only because they play later in the day they have an advantage? This is ridiculous. I’ve never uttered a single bad thing out my mouth about the Atlanta hawks matter of fact I called trae young a superstar when everyone else outside Atlanta says he’s not. Don’t disrespect my teamJoin me on @twitch playing NBA 2K22
