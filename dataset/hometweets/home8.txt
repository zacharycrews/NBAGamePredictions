https://t.co/Xhr2MGO1j9 https://t.co/lhNUoegI8uwishing a very happy toronto raptors season opener to all who observe https://t.co/AG9SB0x5ITThis past March, I had the front page in the @torontostar Sports section looking at what it's like to sit beside @Drake at an @NBA game. I spoke with Sam Cosentino, "Drake's new parents," and @Matt__Devlin - check it out before the @raptors home opener https://t.co/CYh2Hc9p9V https://t.co/yrYhnQTwnJAhead of tonight's @Raptors home opener, let's go back to March of this year when I joined @devobrown on @breakfasttv to talk about what it's like to sit beside @Drake at an @NBA game https://t.co/ADaUlvevmn https://t.co/jKqzmjyaSh@SusnSG @Raptors @henrylstephanie @breakfasttv Thanks, Susan!!

He was constantly taking the raptors to the playoffs &amp; He was consistently ‘the guy’ over Lowry. Offence ran through DeMar. Count on him to do the same thing as last year. That’s what deebo does@SmileyYYC @Raptors Yes!! Let's go Raptors!!💪🏼 game day @Raptors https://t.co/5d7qPotw0OPascal Siakam is the Raptors’ best player. He’ll have to be even better if Toronto wants to improve this year.

The all-NBA forward is setting some lofty goals for himself as the team hopes for internal progression from its roster.

Thankfully we have the Raptors and Masai to always look forward to :)I liked it better when the @Raptors beat the @celtics in their home@opener last year…. And they got booed off the floor.The Toronto Raptors still had the best parade and ring celebration of all timeToronto Raptors fan falls for cruel joke and ends up with free tickets https://t.co/7MOyW8HH55@richarddeitsch @FadooBobcat @JShannonhl @Raptors I was pleasantly surprised you stayed in Toronto after the radio gig ended. Would love to see/hear you more on Toronto/Canadian tv, pods and radio.Nothing to do with Jeremy Lin, but if new york knicks win an NBA championship ... it would be fucking amazing.

OVER 45.5 Wins. Scottie Barnes makes a leap, but the Raptors aren't a true contender

Best: Their analytics department helps this team be great. Everyone takes a leap and SB looks like a future Top 10 stud

Worst: The East passed them by &amp; they lose the play-in https://t.co/sb1Ioey71hIt is the home of the Toronto Raptors of the National Basketball Association and the Toronto Maple Leafs of the National Hockey League.The East is going to be too tough for @raptors this season.Don't miss @Raptors general manager Bobby Webster tomorrow morning on @FirstUp1050 ahead of the season opener against the #Cavs at 8:30am! #WeTheNorth

#Hoopspaces #Hottakes https://t.co/fj6EbJAwP7@sixfivelando You gotta remove two Canadian players and add American players to the Raptors. American players are considered international to Toronto. :)That time a Toronto Raptor made the entire world laugh with just a single word https://t.co/hH6HNSXlgl #Toronto #TorontoRaptors #Raptors #WeTheNorth@greatdane92 @Raptors @PreciousAchiuwa @DALANOBANTON @Khem_Birch @ScottBarnes561 @JusChampagnie @pskills43 @gtrentjr @kolokojunior1 Love this!!♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️@EWMarkey @Raptors You should check out this improvised speech by Michael Sheen for his team. Always wanted to do something like this. https://t.co/cdzBoSJB73Toronto Raptors

Toronto might boast the league’s best defense this year. Their length and versatility are apparent. But barring a leap from their younger players, a deep playoff runs is unlikely. https://t.co/5LcNdGinfV@LeoRautins @KateBeirness @KayNurse11 @TSN_Sports @Raptors It's great to see all of you back!!🙌🥰 https://t.co/4hqyA8w8fORT: Raptors: Season 11.
