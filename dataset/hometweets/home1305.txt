Coin flip for me, both teams match up so well..leaning Miami as I think they’re deeper and have better defenders to throw at Tatum..PJ, Jimmy, Oladipo, Bam (on pick and rolls)..Miami just defend so well, also think they have a better 2nd unit, but again coin flip@iamtzamac @MiamiHEAT @ATT Covid doesn’t exist during playoff sports remember@NElGHT_ @celtics @MiamiHEAT You'll get there bro 💪@MelissasProduce @celtics @MiamiHEAT @warriors @dallasmavs @NBA Celtics VS Warriors!!@JordanH28307585 @UncleRuckus06 @MiamiHEAT @CoupNBA Did it ever occur to you that you're about as "lmao" as a dad joke told by an amish man?The disrespect the @MiamiHEAT are receiving right now after earning the #1 seed after a season that saw so many different lineups bc of injury etc. says a lot…it’s all good.

Sorry @DreamShake_R ! Ts: Codester_3 https://t.co/bFAHLuSJQU@MavsStan41 I think playing the Heat all 3 times the Mavs made the finals is an astronomical set of odds, so I want Miami regardless. Mavs Heat x3Figuring out who to cheer for as a Bucks fan is tough. 

I despise Miami and fake Heat culture. Boston winning makes Bucks loss better but so much flopping.

Luka is great but annoys me and Kidd has so much baggage. I am sick of frontrunner Warriors but I guess they're the team.@smart_MS3 Al Horford @KyleLowry will miss the game tonight @MiamiHEAT @celtics@MiamiHEAT @CoupNBA Most Definitely!!

#NBATwitter #NBATwitterLiveThis free bet is probably all I'm doing for this game tonight. Feel like between Smart &amp; Horford being out + a possible Game 7 hangover, combined with the Miami Heat socialism, it's probably best to not go crazy for a Game 1.

#BleedGreen #HEATCulture 
#BOSvsMIA #NBAPlayoffs https://t.co/Lxu5q85UitJalen Rose: “Each series the Miami Heat have dealt with an opponent that had an injury up front.” 

LOL. The Celtics just scraped by Milwaukee with no Middleton AND Miami is missing a better player than both Horford and Smart. 

But let the narratives begin!NBA East Finals Game 1:
Miami Heat - Moneyline
Over  - 200Game 1. ECF. Miami vs. Boston. Let's go Heat! #HEATCulture #HEATNation #HeatTwitterFunnest thing about this game is when the Miami Heat made a documentary and made it seem like “Wade turned back the clock VINTAGE FLASH IS BACK” and at the very end Alonzo is like “oh yea btw LeBron had 40/18/9 one of the greatest playoff games ever lol but that’s ok” https://t.co/3o8Z1Kt2B0Everyone I MEAN EVERYONE IN THE MEDIA AND GAMBLING  is picking @celtics to win the series.

Run run run the ball to hole every play. @MiamiHEAT  second half blow out. #BOSvsMIAThey keep talking about how the Miami Heat opponent is hurt. Sixers were depleted, blah blah blah.
But barely any mention that our starting point guard who we traded for is OUT.  And has been out. Lowry out is a big loss for the Heat. But you will never hear about it.

#HEATCulture@CelticsHiLights @MiamiHEAT Besides what the numbers say just watching their games and what they did vs Brooklyn was next level making Durant struggle like I've never seen. To me they're easily the best defense left@celticsforum I say @celtics 108 @MiamiHEAT 92Can Bam Adebayo, Miami Heat keep up top-flight defense against Boston? – NBA News https://t.co/h6Y2LDmITo@Mxtips1 Yes i think same, Celtics wins only defending giannis, heat have Butler/hero/oladipo. Miami ML@BADGEPLUG @NBA2K @MiamiHEAT @celtics Celtics 4-2@MiamiHeat_Fra @Gylbret @dearbball 24 pts, 8 passes, 3 stealsMiami -2.

Boston traveling after exhausting series, Heat depth and perimeter defense will be tough. Key to this game: Spoelstra. He will show a lot of bodies to Tatum and Brown. Close series, I think Miami rolls in gm 1 though. #NBAPlayoffs2022 #BleedGreen #HEATCulture🏀 NBA Playoffs

The x-factor for a Heat ring is Bam Adebayo being the baddest man on the court. His screen and roll finishing ability is what unlocks the Miami Heat  a lot on offense.I feel like the Celtics have the talent to win this series, but Miami plays better as a team than the Celtics do.

No question Butler has been a bit underappreciated as his career has gone on, and I'll be plenty happy if he gets a ring. 

Now, does that mean I will be happy for the Miami Heat too? Absolutely not. But Jimmy will receive a tip of the hat! https://t.co/WP8s4IFiHu@stevewilldoit @Nshaheen7 is the biggest Heat fan I know. Also the best high school teacher in the Miami area@MiamiHEAT is the 2022 #nba #Champions

Jimmy Butler amassed 32 points. For the upcoming game one, the Heat have no injured players ruled out. Kyle Lowry (Hamstring) is listed as questionable.@Gavan262 @JustWannaLurkYo Exactly. It’s just like Miami. Lowry is a loss for them but they’ve been better without him because he was playing less than 100% I don’t think any logical fan would say Heat are worse with a 100% healthy Lowry@JeanlucSR @dallasmavs @warriors @MiamiHEAT @celtics Well, let me reassure you about one - there is no @MiamiHEAT versus the @celtics.

No coincidence all these NFL game breakers are flocking to join your roster!!Looking at game 1 of the ECF, Miami is the favorite because they are at home and more rested than the Celtics, but in terms of adjusting, the Heat will need to get acclimated to the series more after taking out an injured Embiid and lethargic Harden.The Miami Heat disrespect is crazy…Let’s go baby .

From our data the money is on Miami ml (-130) and under 206.5. The under is our favorite here, however our safe pick is a prop bet. Max Strus 13.5 points + assists (-125) its a no brainier without Lowry, do not overthink this one. #nba #PlayerProps #NBATwitter https://t.co/wb00vAFGDhMiami hasn’t had a celebration in a while.

Which team has the edge in the Eastern Conference Finals? #NBAPlayoffs #Heat #Celtics  https://t.co/cNeYiB65upI'm gonna need you to stunt on these hoes tonight @MiamiHEAT these Celtic fans getting a little to cocky. Need u to humble them https://t.co/TwaAFimSnF@Realrclark25 @MiamiHEAT @JimmyButler @thepivot @VicOladipo Your attitude is holding u back bruh, no gm spots for ur anger@celtics @MiamiHEAT @espn @985TheSportsHub That's get it Boston.The Celtics and Heat will kick off the Eastern Conference finals Tuesday night in Miami. 

Here are four betting trends to know before placing a wager on the series: https://t.co/zWgcPGm2CI@NBA @celtics @MiamiHEAT game time baby 😤🔥One of these teams will win the NBA Championship:
Golden State Warriors (would be their 7th title, first since 2018, first Finals appearance since 2019)
Miami Heat (would be their 4th title, first since 2013, first Finals appearance since 2020)@foles_burner @StJohnnyboy @celtics @MiamiHEAT @espn @985TheSportsHub U work night shifts?@GuardianOutpost They did the mavs the exact same way! They had the biggest win in game 7 history in any sport and the entire day of sports talk was focused on the suns. They didn’t even mention the mavs. No one is picking on Miami, it’s what they do. Good luck to the heat though.I hope you have a great show today, @JoyTaylorTalks! We are looking forward to seeing Miami Heat take Game 1 against the Boston Celtics! And, just like your former colleague @ZaslowShow said: only 8 more wins until it’s party time! #HEATCulture  @TheHerd @FS1 @FoxSportsRadio https://t.co/8MO6Grhnrk@KLV1063 It's a shame Carolina defeated the Bruins though. Could you imagine if the Heat beat the Celtics, the Panthers beat the Bruins, and the Dolphins swept the Pats? I'd start calling it Miami chowder because we'd then own the rights to that too. 😈@City_Xtra @AdriiFdez @sport Come to the 305 city!!! Right in my neck of the woods...come experience this Miami heat and dolphins atmosphere@NBA Lets go @MiamiHEAT@smitefan20 @RealSkipBayless @undisputed KD went to the Warriors because LeBron went to the Heat? That makes no sense. And LeBron did indeed go to Miami to contend with Boston, but none of that was to beat Kobe…Kobe didn’t even make another Finals after that final year when Bron got beat in 6 by Boston and then left…It’s game day!!! Let’s Go Miami Heat!!

#HEATCultureMy prediction:
- Miami wins tonight in a close game 
- then one of the Boston players gets C0V!D while in Miami (there's an outbreak right now)
- player X has to sit out for at least 2 games. Heat go up 3-0. 
- player X comes back, Heat drop a few games.
- Heat close it out in 6Our Kevin Nivek @kevnivek_ previews the Eastern Conference Finals between the Miami Heat and the Boston Celtics. Who does he have going to the NBA Finals? #NBA #NBAPlayoffs #NBA75

Miami can’t start this lineup. One of Strus or PJ are unplayable, and Strus  &amp; Herro will get hunted.

Celtics opened -165, now -185
▪️ 47% of tickets, 81% of handle on Boston

Heat opened +135, now +150
▪️ 53% of tickets, 19% of handle on MiamiThe Heat are a much deeper team than the Bucks, and the big difference is that Miami does not give up easy 3's. I think this series comes down to the Celtics ability to not only slow down their shooters, but create opportunities offensively.

EVERY OTHER SECOND HAS BEEN CELTICS COVERAGE AND ITS INFURIATING@NBA @celtics @MiamiHEAT the two dominants of east!Buckets Podcast! 

ECF Best bets! 

The Celtics took down the champs (without Khris Middleton) and no one seems to have noticed the Heat… like at all. 

I make the case for why I think Miami has value. 

https://t.co/GBIEQTcKJK@NBA @celtics @MiamiHEAT Celtics in 6@DontGiveaSHIB @stylevish1 @HeatvsHaters @MiamiHEAT Completely agreed@easymoneytweet7 @Satire_R_Us @MiamiHEAT Lmao why do you bring up the past like it’s a big deal right now? At least we had a team that time. You guys were late to the party🤡. The only reason you guys were relevant was because of bron coming to La. if it wasn’t for him you guys would be the jazz🤡@NBA @celtics @MiamiHEAT Butler will show Giannis how to playMiami heat -1.5 3 units 💣💣💣💣💣

Very easy pickI’m taking @MiamiHEAT

The Miami Heat are 43-20 (68.2%) ATS in their last 63 playoff games as a favorite. The Celtics and Heat both have solid defenses and play at a slow pace. I see Miami winning in a low scoring game tonight.

Heat rested, Celtics ended a 7 game series, flew to Miami, 1 day of rest. Jimmy is playing well.

I believe Talent on the other side is the reason he loses this series.@T_Prov @corneil46304300 @tatum4mvp2021 @preccise @MiamiHEAT You think the Celtics would have been running Rob Williams?

They can score and play good enough defense to win. With that being said, Miami needs Oladipo and Herro to have massive games while Jimmy continues to drop 30ppgGame 1 of the ECF is tonight! We have to people in our clan who support a team tonight. @SpxrtanOP (Miami Heat) &amp; @vBlakeOP (Boston CeLtics) 
Who do you think will win? #NBAPlayoffs #HEATCulture #BleedGreen@courtsidefracas In the part before where you settled because of 'negativity'. Boston doesn't have DAWGS like Miami.

Jimmy Butler @MiamiHEAT@MiamiHEAT Not to take anything from the heat, but when their opponents to the Celtics' , it's not even close, people know the Celtics have the better defense, Miami is nice too, should be funMiami heat are in Florida the Boston Celtics are in Massachusetts. There is zero reason to start these games at 8:30 pm lol@PanthersVet @NHL I feel the same.  Its def poor planning @Nhl pitting us vs our Heat and 7pm start time.  If you live in South Miami or in Palm Beach its an easy hour either way during peak traffic to make 7pm.  Expect to see seats fill in around 7:30.@ESPNNBA The MIAMI HEAT! #HEATCultureWe are about to bully these Celtics tonight! @MiamiHEATGood morning.
The Boston Celtics owe the Miami Heat one or two.
The last time around in ECF play, Boston had no answer for Bam Adebayo.
This time around our C’s have Al Horford and Robert Williams.
I’m cautiously optimistic.

https://t.co/VI8n1oj9pc@Jumpshot8 @BryanFonsecaNY I said the Heat were regular season frauds all year and thought they drew the lucky side of the bracket. I also said Phoenix-Memphis since December.

Basketball is obviously much bigger than hockey in Miami, and if the NHL was smart then they would have don’t the schedule where the heat and panthers alternate because that would let fans watch both, not have to choose.The Miami Heat play basketball today by the way@Bam1of1 remember this 🚫🔒#miamiheat #BostonCeltics https://t.co/JNWtUmPWzuHeat Alert!

Celtics🍀 @ Heat🔥

Miami is 8-1 ATS in their last 9 home games but hasn't truly been tested. 

Boston is 13-6 ATS in their last 19 vs Miami but will be exhausted after a tight 7 games.

I like the Unders in what should be a rock fight.

0 - 25% - Miami Heat
25 - 50% - Boston Celtics
50 - 75% - Dallas Mavericks
75 - 100% - Golden State Warriors https://t.co/ZdJ0ARC61i@MiamiHEAT Jimmy 🙂👑Gotta factor in the NBA rig tho RT @SLAMnewswire: Spoelstra and the Miami Heat anticipate a "throwback series" against the Boston Celtics.

"If both teams are really on top of their games, this should be a series where neither team is scoring 130 points."

https://t.co/GqFCrMZAtQ@thunderrosa22 @celtics @MiamiHEAT Rosa. I will say Heat in 6.@JimmyButler’s is about to go into full gear tho! @MiamiHEAT #HEATCulture #heat #nba @NBA https://t.co/tkGDR5dl5G@PNyau9 The only thing that keeps me going is the Miami Heat. Everything else is just too painful.The @NBA @NHL @espn are not doing South Florida any favors by showing the @MiamiHEAT &amp; @FlaPanthers playoff games on the same night. Gees. @BallySportsFL @BallyPanthers 
What does Rodney Dangerfield say?@joshuapolk89fit I personally got Miami in 6 vs Boston and Warriors in 5 vs Dallas.

Heat vs Warriors finals with the Warriors winning the 2022 NBA championship 

2022 NBA Champions = 121

Warriors = 121@ESPNNBA Either @celtics or @MiamiHEAT@VBSofficial_ Show me the Miami Heat segment.

They are also the team I wanted to see the Celtics beat in the ECF.

If the Heat don’t win game 1 they are in world of trouble, but I don’t see it happening imoWhich #NBAPlayoffs Finals you would like to see happen? #NBA @NBA #dubnation #dALLasIN  #MFFL #BleedGreen #HEATCulture @MiamiHEAT @GSWSwarriors @celtics @dallasmavs https://t.co/xED5EVth1F@luisakalefty @MiamiHEAT @FTXArena No problem at all 👍🏽@starkmanjones yo @MiamiHEAT get the AEW crew some courtside seats!@KingJames When you coming back to the Miami Heat??@PEAKFlCTION @Manuelzoom2035 @preccise @MiamiHEAT ya bro because lowry winning a ring as the 3rd option means he's better than Embiid ig4 Teams Remaining !

I vaguely remember a time when you could get balanced reporting from the national media@NiklausWeste @MiamiHEAT Man Nets played no defense and Bucks was without there all star Middleton.🏀#NBAPlayoffs2022 
YTD: 13-4

* Miami Heat -1.5 (Game 1)

Schedule play w Boston 48 hours off a G7 win &amp; having to travel 1500 miles. This is Miami’s best chance to steal a game. Looking to follow this up with big Celtics G2 play if down 0-1.
#GamblingTwitter #sportsbets https://t.co/AKZa0G0U6f@NeedRingHouse Pacers-Knicks often had higher stakes (Miami and NY always met in the first or second round), but I don’t think there was anything more intense in that era than those Heat-Knicks battles.All I know is... @Celtics in 6⃣ vs the @MiamiHEAT. #BleedGreen #NBATwitter@tatum4mvp2021 @MiamiHEAT Who’s asking for that?
