@verizon || Plays of the Week https://t.co/7yxN50qL8TAfter a torn anterior cruciate ligament, or ACL, @warriors fans are wondering when @KlayThompson could be ready to hit the court.

Find hope in a recent @Stanford study that links @NBA playing styles and their impact on knee injuries, like ACL tears: https://t.co/6wueDLpI9N@warriors @JonathanKuming6 Hopefully this earns JK some meaningful minutes in games the Warriors are actually trying to winSources - Golden State Warriors' Klay Thompson eyes January home games for return - ESPN https://t.co/iMjrkxhrzg@password9934 @laje0101 @VirgilMcNutt @swishsmith2020 @statmuse @JonathanKuming6 @warriors @WarriorsPR He had a good game last night. He got to play basically due to the fact that the entire starting 5 for GS didn't play. He's avg 6 minn a game and is essentially a non factor in every single game except for last night.ESPN reporting: The Golden State Warriors are waiving Ben Simmons, per sources.Golden State forward Andrew Wiggins was placed in the COVID-19 protocol on Sunday and will miss the Warriors’ Monday home game against the Sacramento Kings. | @Reuters https://t.co/qyKLwEXY90Klay Thompson does too 😳 @BeMore27 @warriors @NBA #NBA #Warriors #Nuggets https://t.co/I72aSUtusg@fhtaaqui @vagnerlxve Venham ser Golden State Warriors 🌉Warriors send Wiseman, Kuminga, and a future first rounder for Sabonis.
