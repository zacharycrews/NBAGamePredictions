I wish he would though…@Pander952 @AZSportsHistory @ValleySports48 @Suns But there’s more context. Marion left on unhappy terms and seems content being remembered as a Mav since he won a title there.

Obviously never got that good at it but man it was a heck of a shot that made this kid practice more!@Suns @RexChapman @SweetJames I was there. The AWA was loud &amp; thumping for a good 5-10 minutes. Unfortunately, the good guys lost.Apologies to my 0 fans - no days off! Going to ride our wins and lock in:

Marion was more athlete than basketball player and that was pretty much gone by 2010. Good defender and rebounder but most of that was due to his athleticism and length.
