Those 3 above all else by a million miles basically. Maybe Mitch.Mathurin's fit with the Sacramento Kings would be perfect. 

He would provide off-ball scoring which is much needed with guys like Sabonis and Fox on the floor, who often hold the ball. 

The Kings are 20th in 3P% in the league, and just gave up two elite shooters in Hield and-What are some other prospects that the Sacramento Kings would want to look to pick in this upcoming NBA Draft?

Throughout this week I'm going to be taking the time to look at some promising prospects, choosing out my favorites, and explaining their fit with this Kings roster.NBA Basketball Game Betting Picks Simulator: 10:00 PM ET - Denver Nuggets vs. Sacramento Kings - YOU CAN RUN THE GAME SIMULATION FOR FREE HERE: https://t.co/hWXIOiM08n #nba #sportsbetting #freepicks #cappertek@Slowboidex @JuicyJeffMafia @swipathefox @espn @SacramentoKings Just looked into this and holy shit@Slowboidex @swipathefox @espn @SacramentoKings Not to mention leather jahcket spent 10k same day it went sale and I minted my self but they don’t care at all, same after sale went we asked what’s happening we heard nothing for 2weeks they had 2 mods who would stay on chat getting annoyed 24/7 from questions/ ama from swipa!!!@Slowboidex @swipathefox @espn @SacramentoKings I got one too @swipathefox @NBA  De Arron fox scammed us all@infinitesana The Sacramento kings have advance to the western conference finals@BaileyCarlin Sacramento KingsHi, @TMZ  @WORLDSTAR

No. Then the super max he is going to want. No. Then the spacing? No. I swear some Kings fans are delusional. 😂NBA Basketball Game Betting Picks Simulator: 2/24/2022 10:00 PM ET - Denver Nuggets vs. Sacramento Kings - YOU CAN RUN THE GAME SIMULATION FOR FREE HERE: https://t.co/hWXIOiM08n #nba #sportsbetting #freepicks #cappertekBen Stinar is genuinely one of my least favorite people on NBA twitter. Sacramento has an incredibly devoted fanbase and is incredibly intertwined with the Kings. This same logic was used for the Wolves as well. Let cities have their teams.

NBA: Sacramento Kings
NFL: Jacksonville Jaguars
NHL: Arizona Coyotes

Of those 4: Sacramento KingsI’m tweeting @SacramentoKings “you are no Sacramento” after every loss &amp; bad front office move @thatl0calguy@BenStinar Lol stupid and selfish. So the people of Sacramento doesnt deserve a team because of team managements fault? They have the fanbase. Kings just have a stupid owner.🇺🇦🏀 @Sviat_10 of @Raptors and @AlexLen of @SacramentoKings are the active @NBA players from Ukraine.
