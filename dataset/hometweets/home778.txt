The best defensive player in the league, that's also not a zero on offense is an all star, didn't think that'd be disputable. The efficiency seems to be a career-high as well.@warriors he say this like he ain’t been an all star 3 times before@DogSurfRoadshow @warriors What’s one position you feel needs to be upgraded, if at all?@ShamsCharania R u fucking kidding me? The @warriors have 3 all stars? How much fucking help does @StephenCurry30 need?@MSU_Basketball @Money23Green @warriors FUTURE HALL OF FAMER@shaderedemption @rs7united @warriors The only thing therefore that Draymond has over AD is defense and playmaking. The gap defensively is not even big as AD is a solid defender himself.  It when comparing their offensive games AD simply demolishes Dray in skill. 7 vs 23 PPG remember. And it is a down year for AD.Sacramento Kings vs Golden State Warriors | NBA Live Stream
