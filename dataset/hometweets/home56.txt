@regalSZN @Royal23153856 @BrooklynNets Yeah he seems to be the target for the rule change. It looks like they’re going out to their way to not call fouls for him due to his history.@collado04 @BrooklynNets Yeah but Joe Harris is a certified 3 point shooter. Need that around scorers like James and Kev. Patty can do it all@pknbatoday @Royal23153856 @BrooklynNets he definitely will, the refs aren’t calling some fouls that they should for him tbh. seems that his confidence is in a low spot too, prob cuz of his injury idk, just seems like he is holding himself for some reason especially scoring wiseWho's ready for some #NBA?! It's a big test for the @MiamiHEAT as they take on the @BrooklynNets. #HeatCulture #NetsWorld #NBATwitter #NBA75 #NBALiveTweet@BrooklynNets @Boness305 All I could have asked for is Joe Harris to be benched for anybody other than that looks solid for what we have@desire_ijay1 @BrooklynNets literally anyone over HarrisMiami Heat @ Brooklyn Nets Gameday Preview https://t.co/9Pvc9yJ4PK@collado04 @BrooklynNets Ok so when our starters are tired you want Joe Harris LA bembry james Johnson and Carter?@collado04 @BrooklynNets Because Mills is the back up point guard.@regalSZN @Royal23153856 @BrooklynNets Yeah I think he’s adjusting to how fouls are being called now.

If the Heat can get a win in Brooklyn tonight and improve to a 3-1 record with one Nets and Bucks game already scratched off then I'll be sitting here most satisfied.@tuIipsdust Aw, you think so? Thank you so much, I like your name too you know. 🤍 Oh I love Bulls, especially since Caruso is in it now. Mine is Brooklyn Nets! I’m so looking forward to interacting more with you. 🤍Looking at the teams on paper, I really like the way Miami matches up with Brooklyn 

The defensive matchups can really give the Nets trouble in some ways, and you’ll see a fully enhanced Bam on that end tonight
