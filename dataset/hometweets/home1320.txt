#nba #NBAFinals #CelticsVsWarriors #bostonceltics https://t.co/Qfz81HlfYp@EliLake @warriors @celtics I don’t know who leaked this info, but it’s quite the scoop.

However, I’m getting word that if it looks like this will happen, the Celtics will attempt to change the rules of the game that allows the home team to play with 6 players.

Just a little tweak in the name of equityAnyone guaranteeing a #celtics win tonight, clearly is an IDIOT. 

Yea. They might win and I hope they do. But to have confidence in a team that has YET to show they are the same team after a win, is crazy person talk.

Well if they do win it it will have to be over 7 games. But I really feel it’s @celtics year. Either way it’s gonna be fun to watch!#NBA

Boston Celtics ML. 1.5u 🔥🔥@_MindOfMando @PJTuckerBetter @gloom342 @NBA @celtics I never said he was playing badly, just that jaylen was the rightful MVP, look through my other tweets i explicitly said his growth as a playmaker is the reason theyre here. Took issue w the tweet suggesting by his 3p % hes having an efficient series which he absolutely is not@warriors can you make anybody from @celtics go left literally they go to their dominate right hand every time!@xraymission @celtics The tweet of all pinned tweetsThe @celtics should start hunting @Money23Green instead of @StephenCurry30 .
Just for the fun and to see how Dre reacts.
And also, he can't guard JB or JT.

#NBATwitterAnybody need Tix for @stavvybaby  tonight ? Can't go due to the fact my @Celtics  will be dominating at the same time! #AllAbout18It’s simple: I am begging the Boston Celtics to go up 3-1 tonight@WilliamHill #YourOdds Golden State Warriors Vs Boston Celtics - Jordan Poole 19.5+ points , Jordan Poole 3.5+ made 3s , Andrew Wiggins 14.5+ points , Andrew Wiggins 5.5+ rebounds.@xraymission @celtics Maybe a few tops or fleer gum sticks may do it 🤔👍🏼@celticsvisualz @jaytatum0 @celtics +8 AST

thats enough to win@grtinho @PJTuckerBetter @3Angeloo @gloom342 @NBA @celtics Career high 13 assists when he’s having a poor shooting night. You sure you know basketball? The game is passable because it’s a win.See you at 4AM Eastern African Time for the Boston Celtics vs Golden State warriors Game 4. What are your predictions?@BucksLead @celtics You are down so bad lmao. We must have free real estate in your brain@grtinho @PJTuckerBetter @3Angeloo @gloom342 @NBA @celtics He has a left wrist &amp; right shoulder injury. No one talks about it. Even Rob &amp; Marcus get praised for playing injured. Tatum came out for 10 minutes because of his injury but he’s playing through it. Tatum is the new punching bag going forward. It’s already started in the media@giannirios23 @warriors @celtics Warriors@aldurham01 @celtics you would be stupid not to pick up Durham. Having two game changer Als on one roster is beyond lethal@RonFromLasVegas @RedSox @celtics @Mets +736! Love the dodgers. Celtics scare me a bit tonight!@NBATV @FCHWPO @celtics I think he and Tatum should split it. Tatum in that last game was a huge highlight of someone controlling the offense - JokeresqueGrant Williams: Celtics fans don't hold back and we love that about them #Rumors #BostonCeltics #TeamCeltics #Celtics #CelticsTalk https://t.co/4710v8owZy@_MindOfMando @PJTuckerBetter @3Angeloo @gloom342 @NBA @celtics Lmao... so if a player plays bad and his team wins it's not a bad game.... got that.👌😂@grtinho @PJTuckerBetter @3Angeloo @gloom342 @NBA @celtics “If Boston didn’t win” thing is they did win 😂 &amp; it’s because he made those passes in the 4th &amp; didn’t force up bad shots when it mattered most. Also, Tatum is my guy. Im a Celtics fan. No one wants to cut him slack for playing injured but everyone else gets praised 🤷🏽‍♂️Flask made

Why talk about what didn’t happen? They won with a mid-bad game from Tatum@ClutchPointsApp @celtics Too big, too strong, just play, they don't whine or fall down on every shot like @warriors Curry trying to draw a phantom foul.@TermanologyST Best of luck to the @celtics 🏀

Then some 9-10  point wins agains a soft Mavs team lol. Wow how impressive.My favorite #NBAPlayoffs moment was the moment that started this magical @celtics #NBAFinals run. Jayson Tatum’s buzzer beater in Game 1 vs. Brooklyn. Kyrie’s reaction made the moment even more priceless.

But im always gonna stan JB@3Angeloo @SlickAssMF @KingPoe617 @NBA @celtics I get where you are coming from but I think Tatum deserves it a lil more. Simply because they are game planning around Tatum more than JB. The double teams and the crashes on Tatum are leaving JB to have bigger games. Also think he plays a little better defense. JB been great tho@skynosk @KingPoe617 @SlickAssMF @NBA @celtics Browns averaging more rebounds than anyone on the roster at 6-7, while also being a better playmaker than he ever has lets not act like hes been stagnant w the rock himself.

There is a line between "play-off basketball" &amp; letting the game get out of hand. The crowd went crazy when refs called an offensive foul on Tatum after that - whistles swallowed@AppStore @celtics @warriors @NBA Well, I saw one Hockey fight last night on the air, but would like to take both the NBA and NHL series finales in seven as well as into overtime too as well, that is guys…Right now I’m hoping that the warriors don’t get exposed to the same things that the Bulls and Bucks did.@celtics keep fouls to a minimum in the first half. Use a few of them at the start of the second half to slow Golden State runs@NBATV @FCHWPO @celtics It's def JB right now. Tatum tho is still averaging 22-6-8 granted on horrible shooting. But he is the focal point of the offense and therefore receives the most attention from the defense. I could still see him going off for 40+ one of these nights and stealing the award.@frostybias @wcvbrhondella @celtics @joanneborzakian @joanneborzakian is a vibe.

Dude out here looking like a role player.@bobsmietana @peedeelou @warriors @celtics No argument here! Evidence shows that’s true, of course. No one wins on their own.

 3 things to watch for in Game 4 of NBA Finals

1. Celtics will test Steph Curry’s creaky foot early and often

2. Is Jaylen Brown the Warriors’ biggest problem?

3. Grant Williams is playing his way back into the mix https://t.co/EaquQN6MItI got @celtics winning the championship it’s their year ‼️ https://t.co/k5IGTcm7OIHow about @ESPNNBA talk about what really happened in game 3 between @warriors and @celtics. Huge FTA and personal foul calls in favor of Celtics. Game officiated by @OfficialNBARefs Scott Foster. Not surprised this guy is a game wrecker pushing NBA’s agenda. #NBAFinals2022 https://t.co/D94mNE7Nsn@TheSportsMuseum @celtics @paytonpritch3 Good comparison on terms of size. I think Pritchard is a much better player &amp; will have a better career. Jerry absolutely couldn't shoot 3's like Payton but Jerry definitely had the midrange game.

I believe they will, but they seem to be more motivated after a loss.  Much will depend on RW-III's level of activity.  I think Steph will play well.  If Kerr keeps Kuminga on the bench, that will help Boston.

#AllAbout18🏆 https://t.co/pvaU2sZ15g! RT @KGsGOAT: The Boston Celtics are such a brilliantly coached defensive team.

Playing Steph in drop coverage feels like a basketball felony but they've taken away his game-bending advantage creation as a result and made certain guys virtually unplayable offensively.@danderson711 @wmBailey96 @celtics Lmao. It’s the finals what do you expect? Sounds like the fans are getting in their heads. If a Celtic made klay’s comment I guarantee you would be calling them mentally weak for it, it’s your go to.@KlayThompson here’s a big 🖕 🖕🖕 for calling @celtics fans rude. @warriors act the same way. It’s called cheering a team on. So I hope C fans rain boos when you hit the floor.

@mitch_the_quick is on vacation, @aaron___carter is back in Chicago, and the Finals are in full swing.

They also talk flawed 2000s Finals Champs https://t.co/yjBngcny2U@stefhamerlinck @creativeanthony @UniWatch @Vistaprint @celtics @BelovedBrands @CharlesdoPrado It all depends on whether you have made the investment in instilling the recognition of the desired brand asset into peoples minds. 

Of course the Macdonald’s M is recognised, as it’s everywhere. But I’d say I know way more business (and brand) names than I do logos.From the slipped through the cracks department: on yesterday’s date in 1978, with the 6th pick in the NBA Draft, the Boston Celtics select Larry Bird out of Indiana State University. https://t.co/CIdYZS7wtKWhere to buy Boston Celtics shirt here in Madrid!? 😐Big game for the @warriors tonight, not a must win imo but they probably would rather not go down 1-3.

Would love to get to game 7 #NBAFinals https://t.co/YHxd31tX5e@celtics Win tonight win a chip. Yes, we can say it out loud. #Celtics go up 3-1 they will close out in 6.
