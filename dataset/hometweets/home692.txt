Terrence Ross (right knee soreness) and Gary Harris (back spasms) will not play tonight.@Magic_PR @Dan_Savage @OrlandoMagic Never seen an nba team so injured like the magic. Are they being lazy enough to play? Medical staff sucks? Worst than a football team.The Orlando Magic will be without RJ Hampton (knee), Gary Harris (back spasms), and Terrence Ross (knee soreness) against the Bulls.First, you left a superstar, Vince Carter, to go to Orlando with Grant Hill who did the press conference while on crutches

Later, the Magic got the no. 1 pick to draft Dwight Howard and you wanted them to trade it. Soon after you wanted to be traded to go play with Yao Ming.

Been scouring Orlando 2 days, ain’t found nothin : ( #MagicTogether https://t.co/YaSaaD3sZ8@OrlandoMagic @CCDistillery @jalensuggs And 6 turn overs, unfortunately not a career high.Catching up on the weird, beautiful Orlando Magic today. 

*whispers* Jalen Suggs has averaged 15/6/5 while shooting 48% since he’s returned while bringing high level energy on D. Still turning it over/not shooting from 3, but he looks WAY more comfortable than his first 20 games@OrlandoMagic Best center in magic history + some rando on the Lakers@OrlandoMagic NiceSlowMo Saturday https://t.co/vexWw0CgEENets Could Add Key Orlando Magic Role Player via Buyout Market: Report https://t.co/ZkwzF2VHdX@OrlandoMagic @hidoturkoglu15 @STUFFMagic One of the most under rated Magic players ever!Nets Could Add Key Orlando Magic Role Player via Buyout Market: Report https://t.co/2z3bw5N8CVDetroit Pistons at Orlando Magic: Friday, Jan 28th @ Amway Center

They don't seem too problematic either
(I picked the Minnesota Vikings for two crucial reasons - cute purple colour and Curt Hennig.  And Magic for NBA, because Orlando :D)@_tep13 @SI_02_ No- Jordan dominated teams and made them look like the Orlando Magic for a decade. Dominance is something that Lebron and his 4-6 record in the finals would know nothing about. Michael never had to play a game 7. That's why he's the goat.Congratulations to JM7 who moved up 146 spots to take #87 on the Orlando Magic team leaderboard.
