@Raptors were Lebron's teams. Derozan performed just fine against any other team. But no other team in the East could stop Lebron either during that period either so why you hating Demar when he'd improve every NBA team.Toronto Raptors vs Orlando Magic stream is up, https://t.co/AaXRQyhhEi.

Even with his injury, Williams has to look to most appealing to opposing GMs, right. But the Raptors have Barnes.

White? Jones Jr.’s expiring contract?

Siakam seems out of reach…@AmyAudibert @Matt__Devlin @Raptors @Sportsnet @pskills43 Congrats Amy! Gotta say I hear shades of the great @heydb whenever I hear you on the broadcast.

Shit blows meToronto Raptors accepted that DeMar DeRozan and Kyle Lowry are both great players but won’t take them to the mountain top. Why can’t The Trailblazers come to this realization with CJ and Dame? #derozan #NBA75Congratulations to Spadman34 (@Spaddy_) who moved up 2 spots to take #14 on the Toronto Raptors team leaderboard.

#WeTheNorth@The_6ix_man Demar never used to hit game winners like this for the Raptors.

For Toronto he would just go dunk it on someone.@faderunningham I would love to see Demar win the chip with the Bulls. Yes, he was the sacrifice to get Kawhi and the chip. And as @Raptors fan, I'm happy for the chip. But I think that he needed those lean times in SA right after TOR to find that extra level.“You hate the Toronto Raptors but Love Demar Derozan? After all this time?

Bring this back to Toronto please! https://t.co/fRg89JZGFH@DimitrinaStanc4 Darn I missed it. Bembry is a fun player to watch. I think he would have loved  Toronto. Wish he could have made it here with the Raptors!@NBA @chicagobulls Gonna really cry in joy and sorrow, joy for DeRozan playing the way he is now, sorrow for the fact he was a Raptor and we lost him...🥲, DoubleD we still love you here in Toronto, you and Kyle are forever Toronto's sonsAs Raptors fans, I think we all should make it clear now that we will cheer for the Raptors first, but if/when Toronto is out, we then immediately rally around DeMar and Lowry, in that order.Damn. DeRozan (and the city of Toronto) made me switch from being a Bulls fan to a Raptors fan and now he's having a MVP caliber season as a Bulls player and I'm conflicted@AmyAudibert @Matt__Devlin @Raptors @Sportsnet @pskills43 You are right where you should be!! 👍🏻 I love seeing/hearing you at the games! It’s so important for young girls and even women to see “themselves” there, as we have just as much to offer….if not more 😉😉!! Lol KEEP IT GOING GIRL!!! 😊 Happy New Year!! All the best for 2022!!!@SLemonator He’s a @Raptors great. I gotta show love@gosportsgo6 @Red_Dragon23 @WestSS_101 @heyhalima @Raptors It doesn't matter if I agree or disagree, I'm simply stating it's what they cared about and did.  I think because of how ugly the Casey and Demar departures Masai prioritized handling Kyle's better.@Raptors @LouieAguilar08 @OAnunoby Bro looks like he’s heading to South ParkCoreInsights95

Dear Americans,

I'm writing this letter to tell you that this version of DeMar DeRozan is not the same version as the Toronto Raptors DeMar DeRozan. Playing under Greg Popovich has helped his game a lot &amp; he'll show up in the playoffs.

Sincerely,

NBA Twitter@SportsCenter Dero never like this for the @raptors@AmyAudibert @Matt__Devlin @Raptors @Sportsnet @pskills43 We love listening to your commentary.

Wishing you continued success. ❤️@Red_Dragon23 @WestSS_101 @gosportsgo6 @heyhalima @Raptors 2nd half of what I said is more important.  We were clearly determined to do right by Kyle, and given our roster construction, likely preferred Precious of all available.  He wanted Miami, we made it work, that's it.  25 year old Precious might turn out out be good.  Who knows.@jealous497 @statmuse @pskills43 @Raptors LMAOOO@NBACanada @Raptors They both have "RAPTORS SCHOOL "@dark_769_ @DHwrites @Raptors @FredVanVleet I wouldn’t say 4-12 is horrible when you’d say he shot good with two more buckets lol… but he usually doesn’t miss some of the shots he did tonight.@Raptors @pskills43 70,000 watching college football. Meanwhile in Canada.... Haha what a joke@Sportsnet @Matt__Devlin @AmyAudibert Happy New Year to you @Matt__Devlin and @AmyAudibert and thank you very much for calling all the @Raptors game throughout the holidays.@Sportsnet Happy New Year and thank you for allowing all Canadians from coast to coast to coast in all provinces and territories to watch all 7 Canadian @NHL teams in action including @hockeynight on Saturday Nights during the regular season as well as the @Raptors and the @BlueJays too.@DJBuckets4 @chloefor3 @pskills43 @Raptors Yeah he is trash, you are in the league not him. 😂@Raptors @pskills43 Very funny🤣🤣Fantasy / #NBAAllStar numbers from @pskills43

Very natural and a great boost for young women to aspire to@RaptorsGirl99 There's a clip on Raptors FB page of him wishing Toronto a Happy New Year.@kristofszaboXX @chloefor3 @pskills43 @Raptors Nigga no he’s not@YahooCASports Well, the dragon didn't want to be a Raptor. He said as much when the trade was made. And he doesn't fit with Toronto. The worst pairing.@AmyAudibert @Matt__Devlin @Raptors @Sportsnet @pskills43 👏🏻👏🏻well said!  Patience is a virtue.@AmyAudibert @Matt__Devlin @Raptors @Sportsnet @pskills43 Amy, my wife and I watch the @Raptors religiously. I think you are doing a fantastic job at color commentary (in addition to the previous sideline reporting). I think you and Matt have great chemistry, and you explain things clearly. Kudos!@DJBuckets4 @chloefor3 @pskills43 @Raptors Fred is way better than Ball@AmyAudibert @Matt__Devlin @Raptors @Sportsnet @pskills43 You're great on colour commentary.

Congratulations on pursuing your dream job and keep up the excellent work.@AmyAudibert @Matt__Devlin @Raptors @Sportsnet @pskills43 Wow, this was very motivational; you're great at what you do, keep it up and all the best in the new year@JoshEberley If Toronto wants to pay him his $19M while also allowing him to stay away from the team, then more power to them. But from what I’ve seen, even Raptors fans are tired of the situation &amp; want to move on from it.@dark_769_ @Raptors @FredVanVleet Oh Idk then sadly@TheNBACentral @AhnFireDigital Get your sorry old ass in shape so the @Raptors can get something of value for you in a trade (i.e. a salary dump!). This is the 2021 definition of leave for a "personal matter". What a joke!@Raptors @bluejaysart @FredVanVleet Yeah, that career 40% AS lol.@Raptors AWESOME‼️😍🥳 https://t.co/WEZcBceoOS@AmyAudibert @Matt__Devlin @Raptors @Sportsnet @pskills43 I’m really enjoying your perspectives on the game.
