This does look like the perfect situation for him and if he’s motivated anything’s possible…except beating @warriors lol!The @warriors are 1-5 ATS in their last six games 👀

That's what the Warriors did before they got KD. KD's addition made this Golden State team a dynasty.

They had two straight finals with one ring before KD got there.

📽: @warriors https://t.co/wBDU7tcoTN@50isthenew21 @TheWarriorsTalk @warriors @KingJames @StephenCurry30 He’s not gonna reply don’t @ himI’m so used to misinformation on social media that when I see a photo labeled “Ukrainians uniting together after another night of Russian attacks.” I assume it’s a photoshopped image of people leaving a Golden State Warriors game from 2015 or something.Barring an extended hot spell (which is not improbable for him), Steph Curry is going end up with his worst shooting year. Lower than 40% in 3 pt shooting for the first time in his career. Overall shooting % of 43%.

Still an MVP candidate?
