Trendy Model Play📊

0.5u Charlotte Hornets +2 (-120)

The Hornets have been in a slumped losing &amp; this line doesn’t make sense. The line is moving in the Hornets favor with most of the money on the Raptors so it’s a automatic 0.5u play for me.
#FanDuel https://t.co/IqGclY2ZreIf the Toronto Raptors and Charlotte Hornets need a big man, the @Lakers should try to send out DeAndre Jordan and Dwight Howard FOR NOTHING IN RETURN! Just get rid of them  to free up roster spots. Take back rights to European players who’ll never come over. @LakersNation@hornets @MELOD1P My man is allstar as Eric collins would say And that's what I'm talking about ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐@Reggyreg51 Just so you don't think I'm just being negative.

Totally disrespect to all the fans that has been with the @hornets since 1988 long before you moved to Charlotte.  Transplant!!!!!@hornets @Ticketmaster And about Bouk… Melo dealt with same low minutes and wasn’t even a starter till after all star break. And he smiled and bought in to team mentality and worked hard. Don’t we have to question Bouk’s maturity when he gets in Boregos face but no one else is?TORONTO vs. CHARLOTTE - Totals Prediction = 75.47% going UNDER #Raptors #Hornets  Full odds at https://t.co/nUn5OcMPEg@hornets @Ticketmaster No doubt Borego got to get better at managing minutes and sticking with stars. Play musical chairs with others, give Miles, T-Money, Melo +30min. Let UUUUU-bray shoot and tell Cody to stop.The Celtics are ranked 14th in @ESPN’s new NBA power rankings:

If you're comparing the growth of the Charlotte Hornets to the Memphis Grizzlies

You're choosing to 

1) Ignore roster composition
2) That one team is literally one year ahead of the other

Basically, you're doing it wrong.- An offensive slump for the @hornets? 
- A history of UNDERS for both teams recently? 
- Some good defense from both teams?

Sounds like the perfect recipe for an UNDER bet!

This looks like a great time to 'buy low' on the Charlotte Hornets.  They are coming off four consecutive losses and will be highly motivated for a victory.  They are as healthy as they have been all season and are primed for a big effort.@macwfnz and @TBoneWFNZ close down a Monday show by talking with @rodboone about the @hornets' recent struggles, telling you their conclusions from this weekend and wrapping up the show with some funny audio from the Pro Bowl.

MAKE IT HAPPEN @hornets #AllFly https://t.co/KF4wYsv1ln@hornets @cody_martin15 @Calebmartin14 Them boys retarded?I wish the Charlotte media took pride in their job and tried to investigate whatever the hell is going on with the Hornets and their coach. Don't worry, at this rate; you'll be employed long after Borrego is disappeared@money_talks65 @iDude14 KCP got a new contract based off his performance during the Orlando bubble Playoffs, leading to the that 2020 Championship. 😂😂😂
Charlotte Hornets didn’t like the way Malik Monk played defense, so he rode the bench.Who says no?

Charlotte Hornets get off Gordon Hayward’s horrible contract, taking on the younger Jordan Clarkson on a much better contract &amp; Joe Ingles’ expiring contract.

Utah Jazz go all on this year, bringing in the 32 year old Hayward who’s got 3 more max years left. https://t.co/k7KLjtlaPlConsensus Line Move:

#NBA #bet #data #motivation@hornets @cody_martin15 @Calebmartin14 Where is @JimmyButlerSeems there are bigger problems with our @hornets than just loosing 4of5 last games… watch @jam3s210 have to be pulled away from Borrego! 😳😳 https://t.co/n6P6ER6Own@ChasePletcher4 @British_Buzz You just re a lamelo Stan.

Majority of the people got fed up and started trowing jabs at majority of Charlotte fans.

The starting point  was when lamelo got snubbed of the all star and all the fake ass hornets media  was acting like they didnt know the reason.@hornets @BlueCrossNC @cody_martin15 @T_Rozzay3 Need these, sell them pls@LetsGiveItASpin Mason plumlee of the charlotte hornets,  over 9.5 rebounds ( or whatever plus money starts at ) or if the plus money looks good do his rebounds and assists over 13.5 if that’s plus money. It usually is on the book i use.@Arielattias2 @hornets Ayyyy it would break my heart to lose Yurt but it’s what’s best for him if he’s not gonna see minutes here. 🥺@FeatherySquid @PauloAlvesNBA Why would us (Charlotte) make this trade? We’re giving up 2 big players and a future star just to get Wood. I’d like to have wood but not by losing Bouk. Also New Orleans protected pick goes to the Hornets. So we would give up 3 players and a draft pick. So na, we’re good !@HornetsOnBally @jam3s210 @hornets Good things happen when he plays !@hornets y'all sure y'all want to deal with the blatant tanking issue the NFL is about to have to deal with? 🤔👀Check out my latest creation of @hornets rising star @MELOD1P.  #AllFly | #NBAAllStar https://t.co/wyULujakOf@KevLAbeast @hornets @MilesBridges @MELOD1P @ArrowExt @T_Rozzay3 I didn’t know you were a hornets fan, this is awesome.

You have good players we know but: MELO 

Love and good luck!@GobeilNick @Lakers @Raptors @hornets i really try 2 be fair man 
means a lot .... thanx@drew77982753 @Lakers @Raptors @hornets This must be the fairest trade ive ever seen from a Laker fan.

The bar is incredibly low but still bravo@pacers trade turner and lamb for Oubre, and P.J. @hornets #PacersTryna take somebody daughter to @hornets game tbh. She gotta understand that imma be yellin like it’s the And1 Mixtape though https://t.co/A8Ap6p31cO@camutdforever @BrosephSZN @hornets Hayward will still get 30 minutes cuz they have about 30 million reasons to justify it. Which is why he needs to go. Not worth the moneytrade scenario 🚨🚨🚨🚨
3 team trade : 
@Lakers : boucher 
@Raptors : pj washington , ellington 
@hornets : howard , svi , bazemore and a 2nd (LA) 

who says no ?@Arielattias2 @hornets I looked up his stats and he averages 6.1 a game and you guys barely play him. Sounds like a generational talentAye bruh where the trades at? @hornets https://t.co/JC36LZSI64@tallboymp @hornets Can we have ish too?@hornets @BlueCrossNC @cody_martin15 @T_Rozzay3 myles turner is black@hornets @BlueCrossNC @cody_martin15 @T_Rozzay3 sell these shirts@hornets @BlueCrossNC @cody_martin15 @T_Rozzay3 Fire borrego or trade melo &amp; bouknight@hornets @BlueCrossNC @cody_martin15 @T_Rozzay3 make a tradeCheck out 2020-21 Donruss Rated Rookie #202 LaMelo Ball Charlotte Hornets RC  https://t.co/x8DmX3dbp3 via @eBay@Eternity9 @hornets @HornetsPR Angry aggressive black man labeling wtf?

Having a champion vet like Love really helps mentally for your Cavs. That being said, I can't complement y'all too much.@CHARLOTTEMAN3 #FIREBORREGO

Borrego POS COACHDon’t be surprised if you see him in a Charlotte Hornets jersey soon. 👀 https://t.co/TGZ4CAF0Dz@graycarter2115 @PJWashington That would make me as a Hornets fan from our first inaugural season in 88-89 to see that happen. Borrego is the worst coach in Charlotte history to remain with the team more than two seasons. Most of our coaches were fired within two seasons some even a few months.@ATLHawks @chicagobulls @Lakers @Bucks @LAClippers @hornets @PelicansNBA @SacramentoKings @trailblazers @memgrizz @Suns @warriors @spurs @dallasmavs @MiamiHEAT @BrooklynNets @OrlandoMagic @WashWizards @sixers @HoustonRockets @okcthunder @utahjazz @nuggets can still trade 4 dennis@El_Liaison @LaurynnnG I was thinking Roaring Riot and CrownClub could do an event for the charlotte race.

lotsa buzz in the Queen City this season🏀👑🐝 love to see the Charlotte Hornets relevant again as the proud owner of two Hornets caps…@ncgamr23 @MELOD1P @hornets Hopefully the trade deadline brings us something good, we have a lot of good assets.

In all honesty, Im just waiting for next season, because if lamelo and bridges continue to develop, we'll be in a playoff spot.LOVE THIS!

#BIGSHOTS https://t.co/5l7AaYJjWg@MarcoCuamag @MELOD1P this is annoying af for us @hornets fans.  We can beat them damn Cavs...but we need an actual Center and a SF that can contribute (points) on a consistent basis...unlike Gordon Hayward.  I still have a damn headache. https://t.co/G19cELXbXt@priorgunfire69 @freewi11y95 @hornets @MilesBridges @MELOD1P @ArrowExt Trippin@hornets @MilesBridges @MELOD1P @ArrowExt I wonder what this is about, our team or something else? https://t.co/jiFot1xnhv
