The red hot Raptors go up against the underachieving Lakers today.  Here's what I'm looking for:

#NBA75 https://t.co/ntZhO6fEmNLmao These Leafs Fan Really Be Celebrating Losers, this dude says he would rather have Austin Matthews than Toronto Raptors Organization, and they want give Austin Matthews everything like he's kawhi Leonard.@CLETommy @Raptors Yea we do and you can cry all you want Mobley scared of Embiid that dude is trash 🤣🤣🤣@TSN_Sports @Raptors LeBron should be ashamed for trying to injure himFor the NBA analyst saying its classless that the twolves were clowning the lakers, its payback when lebron pretended to sip a beer against my @Raptors in the playoffs. He can't take it. 🤣Toronto Raptors - Los Angeles Lakers

 https://t.co/cOYpYHL6Bc

#SmithAndJones@MARNERRRRRR @6ixbuzztv The guy was suggesting he'd lose the "entire Raptors franchise" to keep Auston Matthews. I'm saying the entire Raptors franchise gave Toronto fans a Cup, and is worth more to Toronto fans than any Maple Leaf player who has yet to even deliver a playoff first round series win.Something about a yt man who’s a hockey fanatic and not even from Toronto talking down on raptors doesn’t sit right with my spirit https://t.co/DdPHvUf47K@NBACanada @Raptors I’m cryingIf The Toronto Raptors   win against the Lakers they will Break the record for most on the road games won 🏆 on there team@NBACanada @Raptors Bring him back pleaseCongratulations to BergAir who moved up 1 spot to take #8 on the Toronto Raptors team leaderboard.

https://t.co/uFactIaoLb@JDBunkis you made an absolutely terrible statement about losing the Raptors over Matthews. How can you say that over an entire franchise?

https://t.co/JZM5FQazJBDream Raptors playoff seeding scenario:

2-Heat
3-Sixers
6-Raptors
7-Nets (via play-in)

-Nets beat the Heat w/ KD, Kyrie &amp; Simmons

-Raptors beat the Sixers... cuz Sixers

-Nets play Raptors, Raptors win in 7 with Kyrie missing all games in Toronto (at least)

-Conference Finals@NickL2500 @PascalFanClub everybody outside of toronto thinks its barnes...toronto guys think its media its the cleveland kid...its not just the leafs media...raptors media doing that now too,,,Here's the 51st in a series of my favorite photos I took in the #yqg before the pandemic. Faces in the crowd are watching the #torontoraptors on the big LED screen at #JurassicParkWindsor inside Charles Clark Square. This photo was taken on 6/13/'19, game 6 of the #2019NBAFinals. https://t.co/tJ7egpfV4b@Raptors Almost a sellHey @Raptors get that 10 day ready. #wingspan https://t.co/1olXStK7Ze@Mike_Schmitz @wojespn Get him on the @Raptors + a nice wingspan@NBACanada @Raptors I miss Norm 🥲 I’m glad he’s happy in Cali tho 🙏🏼@the_raptor @Raptors I thought this was Barney for a second 🤣 https://t.co/8GuZzP1vnG@NBACanada @Raptors LOVE NormThe Lakers move onto game two of four of their road trip, traveling to Canada to take on the Toronto Raptors who very recently beat the purple-and-gold.  @LakersSBN https://t.co/fCHsqj6WsPSeeing lots of chatter about if the Raptors can finish the year taking the 6th seed from the Cavs…

…but anyone notice how Toronto is actually only 2 games behind 4th seed Boston and 1.5 behind 5th place Chicago?  👀

However they finish, THANK U SCOTTIE BARNES!
