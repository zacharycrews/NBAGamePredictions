Ranking 9th in DRTG

They allow the 3rd lowest % of transition plays, so don’t expect much from that part of Miami’s offense 

A product of Bulls’ low TO% and low OREB% scheme (get back and limit transition)

His FT shooting got better with the Spurs. Last year hitting @ 88%. He's making 90% so far this year.  No one gives you the consistency that DD gives you. Experts said he got overpaid. I think he was a bargain. John wall is overpaid.MICHAEL JORDAN 1998-99 Upper Deck Jordan Rules Insert #J3 Chicago Bulls

(on PS4)Just watched the @chicagobulls game. Nice response to a horrible loss but what I loved most was seeing Coby White find his shooting touch. 20pts to go with our 2 all-star guards 20pt games. That’s should be the norm this year. #BullsnationThis is all we saying in the MidWest The Chicago Bulls keep winning 🏆 and we going to the finals. https://t.co/wHVJIoQJ2J@ctsbulls @chicagobulls Bill wennington's career high was 21 points against the Seattle supersonics@MclendonMack @chicagobulls Love it 😊@neilfunkfan100 @chicagobulls It was against the Magic though 🥴 he’s been inconsistent since he came back. I hope he keeps the momentum, but in all reality, we have plenty of guards and he can be a liability on defense. We need some size.@chicagobulls @DeMar_DeRozan @ZachLaVine @CobyWhite Man I’m glad to see Coby coming back and picking up where he left off.@imgunnatell @chicagobulls @DeMar_DeRozan @ZachLaVine @CobyWhite If he plays like this against the Heat tonight I will.@MclendonMack @chicagobulls @Stacey21King a real one for taking care of youAwesome night. @chicagobulls #BullsNation https://t.co/BajNsyEnJoMy life has changed so much this year.

I don’t think they stand a chance in hell against the Nets but I could def see them making it to the ECF and putting up a fight! They just don’t have anyone who can slow down KD. Same with the Bucks, nobody on that squad can guard GiannisI will never understand the NBA schedule makers. So the Bulls play a back to back against the Magic and Heat but one is in Orlando and the other in Chicago. Why not just have them take the hour flight from Orlando to Miami?@MyBallsHang @chicagobulls @DeMar_DeRozan @NikolaVucevic @ZachLaVine Congrats you beat our benchMariah Carey 🤝 Chicago Bulls
