Does he live in Utah again?  Passing thru?  Doing a project?  Seeing Ice Cube in concert?  Helping the Jazz in some way?  Nice to see him again!  Stay awesome, good sir! :)@leaguefits @JordanClarksons @utahjazz Tough fit king 👑💪Congratulations to JMttm who moved up 3 spots to take #25 on the Utah Jazz team leaderboard.

That was Utah Jazz's last regular season triple-double.

Prayers up 😔🙏@danielrainge You need to get some coach and player issues fixed for the @utahjazz to improve and become the dominant team that they should be. Coach Snyder needs to play his best player and scorer.

Raising a child with suicidal ideation is incredibly difficult and schools certainly didn’t make it any easier. I hope you and your child are both doing well.@currypistonn One of the greatest defensive players of his generation and a Utah jazz legendAs I watch the super bowl, I keep thinking how the Utah Jazz were so fearful of the player we traded for, that they had their defenders play *behind* him as a basketball strategy.
