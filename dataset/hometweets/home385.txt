Just like the 2020 Orlando bubble Playoffs 2nd Round against Russell Westbrook’s Houston Rockets. THT, only a rookie with 5 consecutive points from that same right wing.The Houston Rockets are winning, a lot, with the help of a Celtics training camp castoff, two second-year undrafted players and an extremist approach to modern NBA ball.
