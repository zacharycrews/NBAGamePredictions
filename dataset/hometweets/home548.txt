Thank you @Dame_Lillard! 
I respect your acknowledgement of our beloved SUGA @BTS_twt. Hopefully the 2 of you will be able to meet one day soon. I love a good and humble underdog story 💜🏀❤🤍@This_Justin25 @JeremiahBurnett @CHold @trailblazers An abdomen injury completely throws off your balance. For Dame’s game, that’s incredibly dangerous because of the shots he takes and the distance he shoots from. It’s a huge adjustment but I see what you’re saying. The team needs a lot of workNBA 04/01/21

Unless they’re sideline reporters for the Portland Trail Blazers.On this day in sports history January 3, Golden State Warriors Point Guard Stephen Curry scored 62 Points in a 137-122 win against the Portland Trail Blazers in 2021.I would really like to see the @trailblazers make a move for Demontes Sabonis somehow if the Pacers are willing to part with him. He is exactly what Dame needs. Gets easy buckets, hits the 3, great ball handler. Tremendous pick n roll game too. Oh, and he plays solid D@Yung_Tom_Brady @DevenMurray3 @trailblazers What? It ain’t logic. Y’all just get mad cause “Olshey” or “Billups” lol. Then on Twitter tryna act like you know shit. Lololol, then claim other people are mad when y’all the ones on here complaining 😂Updated @cryptocomarena Standings 2022/1/2
