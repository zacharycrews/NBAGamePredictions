*These are all straight bets, GOOD LUCK 💯@HeatNationCom @eric_torrente I Love Goran Dragic, The Miami Heat should bring him back.❤️🔥🔥🔥@RaheemZeno @cambermc What? This only further contradicts your original point lol. The Heat had literally the same attendance both those years. And still top of the league. A difference of 41 on avg. Obv LeBron draws eyes but that has nothing to do with Miami always having top of the league attendance@MiamiHEAT Hmmmm is Victor available or no longer with the team??@Vizzy_rayven The Miami heat Vs the raptorsI am rightfully annoyed that Goran Dragic is in Miami, going to Miami Heat games, while Fred Van Vleet busts his ass 40 minutes a night. It's clear that he never intended to play here, he said so he tried to go back on it before summer league but his actions show that he meant it@MiamiHEAT @iamgabevincent2 See you guys Monday in Boston. I will have the only Miami Heat shirt on LOL. See you monday!!!!!!Toronto Raptors star Fred VanVleet is returning from a two-game absence against the Miami Heat on Saturday.
https://t.co/Bv8AhToTtr@jeremytache Play basketball for the Miami Heat, did I win?@MiamiHEAT Personal reason..? Maybe his in trade market 🤫@nowhitechalk @MiamiHEAT Mostly what you said, offense wasn't there and the switching prevented him from getting many downhill opportunities.

Heat-Raptors Over 209.5

The spot is perfect for a couple of top 5 over teams. Miami is 6-1 to the over on the 2nd leg of a B2B. Toronto is 9-2 to the over with a rest advantage! GIVE ME POINTS! https://t.co/HBxrXI4Z4P🏀NBA PLAY🏀

Heat -3.5

-Miami has covered 4 of their last 5 at home
- This line has dropped 2 points with money coming in on Toronto.
- I like this play even more if VanVleet is out. The Raptors are 1-4 in games without him this season.

#NBATwitter #GamblingTwitter #NBA https://t.co/9dPSqyM5oR@EspoZack Raptors and heat is interesting. While Miami has a great paint defense, they filter everything out to the arc and make teams beat them that way which leads to a lot of made threes for opponents. OG  Gary Trent and FVV could be in for some solid games behind the arc.Jimmy Butler connected on a perfect 16/16 from the foul line vs. LAC, marking the most FT made w/out a miss during a single game in HEAT history, surpassing previous record of 15, which has been done 3 times.

The other team calls timeout to stop the bleeding and freeze momentum.  Minus injury, usually that is why the timeout happens.@SRochesterNBA @MiamiHEAT @5ReasonsSports @CoupNBA What I take from this is that Spo makes the opposing coach take the first timeout in most games and that’s a product of the Heat starting quarters very well@MiamiClutchPE @MiamiHEAT @5ReasonsSports @CoupNBA Look at the summary, not the game by game.

Why take a hard foul when the person is not even trying to shoot. You could just tap on his hand and that’s a foul. Morris def wanted beef with Jokic and that’s what he got. Elbowing someone in the chest is trying to injure them too.Updated @MiamiHEAT timeout data through 49 games. @5ReasonsSports @CoupNBA #SpoKnows https://t.co/KibQT9Wel3Absolutely love this from @MiamiHEAT guard Max Strus on shooting!!!

Wasn’t he in a shooting slump? Wasn’t he getting outplayed by Strus? The fans were upset because he was in a long slump. I don’t think he is owe an apology for getting back to what Miami Heat fans are use to.@KCEgamer @Titanfan86 @BradenTerrell @JaMorant This kind of take makes it obvious that no one has been paying attention to the Miami heat besides their record and it’s not their fault.

Their lack of a superstar in some ways makes them more dangerous. You don't know who is gonna beat you. 4 or 5 guys may hit 20. 7-8 guys may score 10+. Maybe their starters beat you. Maybe the bench. You can't sleep on them@LaVinesBurner @LonzoBullSzn You think this is bad, look at what I had to deal with when we got swept by them. I was at the game when the Heat were swept in Miami and I was in the bucks page montage video of Heat fans talking shit and had to deal with them all summer and all the old tweets they found broIt was another suffocating night on the defensive end, which we love to see, and that's what sealed the deal after Gabe's offensive outburst

We need Lowry back soon. PJ has saved us so many times this month with that corner 3, Bam looked dominant and Gabe keeps getting better.

32-17. 1st seed🗣@MiamiHEAT Another shady 4th quarter man.  Gotta do better.@MiamiHEAT Winning@MiamiHEAT Man y’all love playing with our emotions so much 😅We buyout ready.

https://t.co/IIuYCTQkL5@MiamiHEAT Fourth quarter the new turd quarter@MiamiHEAT can you guys please lose a few games@MiamiHEAT The Heat media needs to ask Spo about the 4th quarter offense. Especially the last couple mins. 

Yes Lowry will help, but it's still been an issue many times.

They make it a lot harder than it should be.The Miami Heat are menaces. They always let teams back in it after leading by 20+, but always seem to hold on in the end@MiamiHEAT TRUEEEList of Miami Heat players with at least 5 3-pointers made this season:

Gabe - 2 
Duncan - 12
Max - 5

I don't think the Clippers are going to be able to pull off another impossible comeback against. Miami seems to be taking them seriously. I sure do hope I am wrong.Clippers had it down to 11 but a quick 5-0 Miami run effectively neutered the Clippers' momentum. Clippers are theoretically in this but they're going to need the Heat to stop making an exorbitant amount of 3s in this second half.It's 96-80 Miami heading into the fourth quarter. For as hard as LA battled, the Heat still won that quarter 39-35.End of third quarter: Heat 96, Clippers 80.
