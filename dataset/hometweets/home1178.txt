https://t.co/WMuZp8BAY2@madnesskingdom I think it's true that there's just vastly more demand for a Disney/universal type experience than currently exists. The US could probably support several more magic kingdom/IOA scale parks spread around, but as that's not there, Orlando and WDW get pummeled with guestsThis evening at 7pm the Cleveland Cavaliers play Orlando Magic.  Cheer on the Cavs on WLEC! Airtime begins at 6:30pm. https://t.co/uUNBZwW1YnGive #Cavs credit for holding things together. But they still need to keep winning to avoid falling to 8th.

Will #Orlando Magic suit up? Or is it an easy decision data-wise?📊

In a big game for Cavs and Orlando getting smacked in the last games, there's a high chance of blowout. Also since the game in Cleveland, Magic are the worst team in FGM, so I guess there's going to be a lot of chances for himAlways point to Dwight/Orlando as wildest of all trade sagas.

After a well fought game against Philly, we are in Orlando. In what should be an easy win as the Magic are in the midst of a 6 game losing streak. Evan, JA, and Dean are out. Suggs and Carter Jr. are out, Anthony and Wagner are questionable for ORL.

IF and when he comes back is the ONLY time he should be included into the equation.

With that said, if Isaac is the only reason why you don’t draft Chet then the choice is obvious imo. https://t.co/vDfRY0ffo5Can we draft Love with our second round pick?
