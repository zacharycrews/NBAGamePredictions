#sportsbetting #betting #sportspicks #gamblingtwitter #gamblingMultiple sources have confirmed that Lima Senior grad Zavier Simpson has signed a 10-day hardship exception and will finish the season with the Oklahoma City Thunder.Do the Oklahoma City Thunder have too much of a good thing? For @spotrac I looked at the situation in OKC:

-What picks do they really have?
-Are those picks really that valuable?
-What's the cap and roster look like next year?
-What about in a few years?

https://t.co/nDHH7cOb2h🏀 The Portland Trail Blazers are on a seven-game skid entering tonight's game against the Oklahoma City Thunder. Can the Blazers turn it around or will the Thunder hold firm at home? @RossBenjamin1 shares his thoughts on tonight's matchup.
https://t.co/9BtLgEeUOiAfter a solid G League run, Giorgos Kalaitzakis will finish the season with the Oklahoma City Thunder.

The Greek forward's NBA future is still up in the air, though 🤔
