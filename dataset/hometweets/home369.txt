You’d like to take advantage of a game in Miami for standings purposes, but the remaining schedule in December is very soft and the chances of a Heat player injuring someone seem high.@NBALatam @Bucks @MiamiHEAT Buttler outThe New Reality For The Miami Heat | Donno Daily on 5R Live https://t.co/f4eUMa7RZz via @YouTubeLet's go HEAT!
