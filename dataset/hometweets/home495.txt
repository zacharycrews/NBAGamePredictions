Wiseman if/when he’s back, then sure. But Klay is an OG round these parts and doesn’t dominate the ball.. he’ll fit in just fine. Once his wind comes back and shots fall.. it’ll be like he never left@chrisechols @RagingPHX @Jumpshot8 @Suns Like I said.. Klay may not come back and be as impactful as some fans are expecting.. of course there will be an adjustment period with changes in rotations. But Klay is a high IQ off ball shooter that plays great D, knows all the key guys and is beloved in the locker room.Sources — Phoenix Suns coach Monty Williams in COVID-19 protocol https://t.co/ilMIjWJa7v@ValleyoftheSuns @Suns @C4s_Story Just chill.

Stop mAking excuses that’s like warrior fans saying the only reason they chocked 3-1 is cuz of Steph knee injury. They didn’t rise to the occasion it is what it is.The @chicagobulls, @Bucks, and @MiamiHEAT ride a 3-game winning streak, closing in on the @BrooklynNets.

Nobody on Earth is gonna say Curry, 'cause the dude's a real life magical wizard, and everyone's a GSW fan now. Didn't notice GSW fairweathers WAY louder in phx both games? You think 10k drove down from oak?@Jumpshot8 @Suns Suns who made the finals at one point in 3rd quarter got outscored by kuminga Toscano chiozza bjelica and Witherspoon on the field 🤣Just ran into a nigga decked outnin Lakers gear you know what dis mf said ?!?! @Suns got it dis year..@RagingPHX @Jumpshot8 @Suns Their guys played in the finals and couldn't run up the score with a lineup of weathrspoon chiozza Toscano kuminga bjelica on the field at one point for 5 minutes...😂😂🤣@Moses_moods @ClutchJackson @Suns Ill tell ya this though. An ego is not something most suns fans have. Weve had our runs back in the 90s with Barkley and the 2000s with Nash but weve ALWAYS been stomped one way or another.

Iggy too old to carry him again and KD is gone.   Just like everyone said the 1st game, Steph had an off night, Book was 5-19 which was an off night.  Closer if Book wasn’t off.@gr73159199 @KahrimanovicNed @pinc2448 @RagingPHX @Jumpshot8 @Suns y’all are basically just the 2018 rockets bro pack it up@Jumpshot8 @Noooobody_Cares @RagingPHX @Suns the warriors players are champions, that is the differenceThis 3-day weekend was one of the best weekends I ever had in a long time.

Loved the suns in the 90s.@Jumpshot8 @Suns Now say it without crying https://t.co/OqnRZ8OV34I dont think @Suns will even make western conference finals…. They play very slow basketball because of their elderly pg Chris Paul….he may need to come off the bench for clutch moments in spurts @WarriorNationCP @warriorsworld @NTD1208 @antonin_orgNowPlaying Sun Drifting the Phoenix Coast and the Man Eating Probability - Wave Temples https://t.co/X4qtYyw4B7 02:22-
Bought myself a parting gift, since I'm leaving Phoenix for Houston tomorrow morning.
GO #SUNS   @DeandreAyton @Suns 🏀 https://t.co/3KXmzVmGqlAnd that'll wrap up the Grizzlies postgame media availability. Grizzlies are back in action tomorrow night against the Phoenix Suns. Tune in and don't forget to get your votes in for the All Star game.

@bcabraham logging out@matthewgmccabe @RagingPHX @Jumpshot8 @Suns Lol even just an average job. Keeps him to 50% shooting.

Then can actually catch a lob unlike Looney? Huge swing just there@BringTheHeatAZ @Jumpshot8 @Suns Acting as though he’s not double and tripled teamed on the regular.  How about you try and be efficient with that defense on you.  And they still lost and he dropped 33. Salty@gkfahnbulleh @Suns Wow I have never seen a trap before.@Jumpshot8 @Suns Guarded like this and he STILL scored 33 https://t.co/8v1I4aw26T@BeanieButler @TheEdgePHX @NBA @dougducey @Suns @warriors @9thFloorAZ A "study of studies" does not prove anything. Only one of these studies was a random assignment study: the Netherlands study.  The "I always wear my mask" group had the highest infection rate.  Only N95 provides perfect protection.@Jumpshot8 @Noooobody_Cares @RagingPHX @Suns No bias in that reply at all.@Jumpshot8 @Suns Imagine warriors were at full strength and suns were 2 and the warriors lost and said we only lost because chioza and damion lee werent playing lol yah would've roast the fuk out of us@Jumpshot8 @Suns Actually Booker got worked over by GP2; so there’s that!Check out 2015-16 Panini Complete #323 CAMERON PAYNE RC PHOENIX SUNS THUNDER FREE SHIPPING https://t.co/QVZyjsH0hq @eBay@RagingPHX @Jumpshot8 @Suns Dubs won by nine. It wasn’t all that close. In Phoenix.

And of course it matters that Dubs were missing two starters and a sixth man. Just like it matters that the Suns played Booker 40 minutes trying desperately to win.@RagingPHX @Jumpshot8 @Suns This is really sadly hilarious. Porter Jr. is better at basketball than Eddie was, yanno? And the difference grows in the playoffs. More efficient scorer, better rebounder, better defender, .1 % worse on assists. Eddie chucked it - Otto shoots it. Wins more, too.@evxz17 @Suns My photoshop king 👑👑https://t.co/sGw92pgTz6

@memgrizz vs @Suns Are the Griz contenders in the West? What is the Suns path back to the finals? And how YOU should bet this one. #GrindCity #Suns #GamblingTwiitter@Jumpshot8 @Suns Stanning for this org ? https://t.co/IE5Oc4nJMNPhoenix Suns' Jae Crowder, Elfrid Payton in NBA's COVID health and safety protocols https://t.co/NFKGNlOo4e@RagingPHX @Jumpshot8 @Suns Suns fans said the same shit when they won with no Booker in the 2nd half of the first game. Sun lose the 2nd game and OH, no Booker. FOH
