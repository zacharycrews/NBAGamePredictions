2. You don't strengthen the championship contenders in same conference

They absolutely robbed the Blazers. Clearly, @trailblazers are focusing for next season.Fuck the @Trailblazers!  Just because they're too incompetent to achieve anything (at all), doesn't mean they should be allowed to trade away their assets for NOTHING!@trailblazers Admin tweeting this. https://t.co/QPsNV9RXR9@CreeperDude17 @trailblazers Me neither@trailblazers 2 team posters per year.
I mean do they even bother making them? Go Blazers!!@damewearszero @trailblazers @Holla_At_Rob33 Imma be there too@trailblazers How hard was this to tweet? Thank god Covington isn’t a Blazer tho.Clearly the moves that the @trailblazers are making are to make room to eventually sign Bronny and bring LeBron James to Portland! 

Wake up, sheeple! https://t.co/OHYSIMd71p https://t.co/pBcuSXTNd9@trailblazers @Holla_At_Rob33 It's obvious that most of you responding to this post, do not know how this works.

Is the @NBA really not going to overturn one of the most lopsided trades I've ever seen?  Of course not!  Only Laker trades are allowed to be overturned.@TannerPetrey @bosnianbeast_27 @GaryGoatJr @trailblazers Dear god@trailblazers sorry you had to do that@trailblazers @Holla_At_Rob33 STOP!@Notkatty12whopp @Ddelliponti08 @trailblazers I know with it still a smart move for the off seasonWhy did we give @npowell2404 away for nothing @trailblazers ? 😭

I know Dame has to be in shambles rn 🤣@ZAboutaj @trailblazers The clippers get the most value here. But I think the blazers can actually get better. Justice Winslow might be the 2nd best wing defender in the league, behind Kawhi. He’s been playing insanely well recently.@trailblazers @Holla_At_Rob33 Gonna miss you roco😥@ShaggySquid @trailblazers @Holla_At_Rob33 Fare trade then@Birdstache @trailblazers We will drop him off there, free shipping, just say yes @trailblazers@McTannerV1 @trailblazers @CHold Oh god https://t.co/X7wmBiV0eU@trailblazers @Holla_At_Rob33 WHY WHY WHY WHY WHY WHY WHY WHY@trailblazers @Holla_At_Rob33 Roco, ngl, I didn't want to see you go!

Fuck y’all @trailblazersNot excited about the Blazers move today but let’s be honest…Norm was never the right guy to begin with. TRADE FOR A LEGIT WING. @trailblazersI haven't seen a single basketball writer give the @trailblazers a better grade today than the @LAClippers.

Sure, fans can be irrational. But fans aren't stupid, either.

You can't win every trade. But you can lose them, and it seems the Blazers could have not done this deal.@wojespn The @trailblazers going full rebuild in Year 10 is NOT productive to the 💍 effort. @Dame_LillardOklahoma City Thunder @ Portland Trail Blazers

I'm sure you'll get a great deal.Russell Westbrook can be your tank commander, or if you’re not looking to tank, he can get you to the play-in tournament. The opportunity is right there @trailblazersJoe Cronin @trailblazers is an absolute disgrace.
