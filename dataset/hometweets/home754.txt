#NBA #sportsbook #statistics #realestate@Celtics_PRam @celtics Kyrie is an exceptional talent who has severe trust issues.
I hate to admit it, but if I had him as a player he’d have to murder someone to not play. You can say he’s the best guard in the game right now.
Severe trust issues@JRZ_74 @celtics Convincing Al to stay while closing the gap between the 4/84 Boston wanted to pay him and the 4/108 the Sixers offered would’ve been the toughest obstacle here.@diandraann Impossibility

At worse Utah Jazz, New York Knicks, Cleveland Cavs, Detroit Pistons and Boston Celtics fans were closet Jordan fans.  At worse@gothgar666 @celtics He brought ya to the ECF lmao
I don't think age was a problem@Celtics_PRam @celtics I can see it PRam but it’s almost like the Charlotte Rozier and the Boston Rozier are not the same players.
Kyrie will haunt us in a long painful way like Bias does. That wound won’t ever heal.@celtics pls win https://t.co/VQ1v4ZtZzb@FanDuel boston celtics@nikgazcs2 @NBATV @MiamiHEAT @celtics Thanks, the graphic says otherwise for some reason@JRZ_74 @celtics Yeah that was the worst blow for sure, changed everything, but Kyrie would’ve eventually caused problems for sure.

You don’t see how we could’ve kept a guy who we could’ve matched any offer he got as a RFA and kept a guy under contract for us that year?Jimmy Butler @JimmyButler (ankle) out for Mon's contest vs the @celtics !

Butler and P.J

Like putting Bias on the ‘87 roster@Celtics_PRam @celtics Hard to connect the dots where we somehow keep Terry and bring in Gordon.
Honestly think the foot injury to Gordon altered course as much/if not more than Kyrie. That injury was devastating. Still suffering from it.@celtics Bring in IT even just to be in the arena if you’re honoring the 2010s… https://t.co/eJbRrEVlrH@gothgar666 @celtics Yeah and who had the last laugh in 2012 lmao.Mickey Mouse win @celtics@celtics What exactly are we celebrating?

Maxey was a deal sweetener to balance that out.@Patrickgreen18 @The_Best2098 @Jitesh121187 @celtics not really. Just bc someone is able to be salary filler doesnt mean teams would take it. Bol was being traded for a 2nd originally, and PJ was going to be let go at the end of the season.
