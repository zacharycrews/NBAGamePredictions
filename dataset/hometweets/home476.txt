In the NBA talent is scarce. The Golden State Warriors value player development and acquire players who share this mindset.

Grizzles going for 2s while GSW will be missing their 3s up to 15 to 20 mins, behind 12 to 18 points then they realize we need to shoot 2s. BB IQ..shoot more 2s, drive to the paint, get fouls.The Golden State Warriors are trading Marcus Smart to the Lakers for a 2022 second-round pick.Steve Kerr @SteveKerr

Golden State Warriors @warriors 
GSW missed 3s, not trying 2s and then they fall behind. GSW needs to drive to the paint more than the 3s will be opened to shoot. WATCH GRIZZLES tomorrow; they will drive to the paint for 2sTop-3 rivalries in the NBA #BostonCeltics #ChicagoBulls #ClevelandCavaliers #DetroitPistons #GoldenStateWarriors https://t.co/EOwVbeQKes
