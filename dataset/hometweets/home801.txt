They got a good young core in place, and A TON of upside draft picks rolling in.

I honestly think all 3 teams made out well in the trade (Obviously, BKN needs to win or it’ll hurt).Event #20 of 2022.

He comments on what advice he gives his players regarding the outside noise of trade rumors; he says Josh Christopher is reading defenses better. 

Watch: https://t.co/vOezscNBsr via @YouTubeIf the point of the trade is "win maximum games in the short-term," then absolutely, the Rockets lost and Brooklyn/Cleveland won. That is not how Houston is looking at it, and I don't think it requires four-dimensional chess to understand their thinking.Today's NBA Picks: 7:10 PM ET - New Orleans Pelicans vs. Houston Rockets - 19 PICKS AVAILABLE: https://t.co/JIvB8vnEWG #nbaNew Orleans Pelicans vs. Houston Rockets | USA: NBA - 07:00 PM, February 06, 2022

One of the great things of being a Houston Rocket you have so many people willing to help especially guys like him, Rudy T, Calvin Murphy..Clyde Drexler..It’s great.”@DavidMorant48 @DoTheJohnWall02 @verybIoody @HoustonRockets Your mistake is using percentages. Use totals and add context. Let’s say the Rockets won those 9 games. The Rockets would be 24-28, in 10th place behind the Lakers, which would qualify for the play-in tournament.@BigSargeSportz Same thing with the Rockets…if you think about it Houston is a boring city unless you like clubbing at Washington st…….we have nothing here in Houston that would attract tourists@FarahU89 That's true. 2017-2018 Houston Rockets had the chance to win it all. Every year when the series get tight he cant handle the pressure even with the help of CP3 etc. Even he gets help he cant event handle itHouston RocketsThey didn't do anything with Olynyk's Bird rights and it appears the Miami first-round swap won't be used (due to Brooklyn falling apart, which in the net brings far more benefits than harm to the Rockets)

So, can you say Houston "lost" that component of the deal? Sure. But...📅 On this day in 2020, the @HoustonRockets Russell Westbrook scored 41 points in a win over the Lakers, surpassing 20,000 career points in the process.

Westbrook became the third player in NBA history to reach career totals of 20,000 points, 6,000 rebounds, and 7,000 assists. https://t.co/2tZJn160wa🏀 New Orleans Pelicans(-5) @ Houston Rockets(+5)

Pels are looking for 3 Ws in a row tonight in Houston. With all the trade rumors going crazy, Pels have to lock in and take care of business against this Rockets team. As the POR free fall continues, Pels have a HUGE opportunity ahead of them starting today.

You cannot give Houston Rockets all this asset to get James Harden then only to watch Harden walk-out to 76ers two years later 

Please pull the trigger

Yet you STILL want to say they have a lot of "close losses"?

Your own numbers show 76% of the losses are by double digits ..

Only 24% are by less than 10 points

The Rising Stars game of the #NBAAllStar features Fil-Am rookie Jalen Green of the Houston Rockets. https://t.co/kxOSaCkRDO@DavidMorant48 @DoTheJohnWall02 @verybIoody @HoustonRockets Realistically and results-wise, the Rockets has the defenders to win more games. The problem is not their individual defense. The problem is their communication on team defense (e.g., switching positions). A lot of losses were within 8 points or less, so don’t stress.I love Rockets James Harden. I would 💯 welcome him back to Houston. https://t.co/PkIqWzhwU9@RooshWilliams Yeah, Houston owning the picks through 2027 of the team that no longer has Harden and is getting dominated by expensive role players definitely isn't an indicator that the Rockets did alright in that trade.The Houston Rockets Gerald Green had 69 points 24 rebounds.“So why did you tweet out that James Harden should be back to the Houston Rockets?

#Rockets https://t.co/1TzV6C3us4@MikellMoon @DoTheJohnWall02 @verybIoody @HoustonRockets Bless your optimism, Mikel ... but I'm more into realism and results.

I'm tired of seeing them let go 130 every game.

Can't win that way ... something's gotta give.@MikellMoon @DoTheJohnWall02 @verybIoody @HoustonRockets Most points allowed per game in the NBA ... yeah ... Great defense in spurts.

If we've got SO many great defenders like you seem to think ... let's play THEM the bulk of the minutes and only give light to no minutes to those who don't want to play it.

No defense = Losing..I cannot find good seats for this @HoustonRockets game..&amp; I’m not seating in the nose bleed section..Houston Rockets fans who want James Harden back are hilarious 😭

He gained WEIGHT just to force himself out, and he left the Nets for dropping to 6th in the east, why would he join 15th seed Rockets 🤣🤣🤣Happy birthday to rodions kurucs of the New Jersey nets #rodionskurucs #newjerseynets #houstonrockets #milwaukeebucks https://t.co/urUgL9PNsY@TheNBACentral @sam_amick So the Houston Rockets are tampering?NBA 2K22 MyNBA EP 23 | Houston Rockets
