And they're no doing it to him, he's doing it to himself. What happens if Brooklyn plays Toronto in the play in and Kyrie can't play because it's in Canada and the Nets lose.

The #Hokies hit a game-winning 3 in OT, then upset Notre Dame, UNC, and Duke, and cut the nets in Brooklyn.@ShookJJ @kirkgoldsberry @celtics @PelicansNBA @MiamiHEAT @Lakers @BrooklynNets @warriors @memgrizz @Timberwolves @Suns Agreed. Thanks for responding back.@KeithGrant09 @kirkgoldsberry @celtics @PelicansNBA @MiamiHEAT @Lakers @BrooklynNets @warriors @memgrizz @Timberwolves @Suns Well as I recal it was against the hornets. And the hornets didn’t get up a good shot for like 75% of their possessions it seemed to me. And the Celtics are moving the ball on offense.I keep a burna like Kevin Durant, Brooklyn Nets dressed in all blackDeAndre' Bembry (constipation) won't return Saturday.

Wow. What a world we live in.So Kyrie is allowed in Barclays Center to watch Duke but not to play for the @BrooklynNets ?!? #trustthescience ™️So let me get this straight, Kyrie can’t play home games for the Nets but he’s at the ACC Championship Game in Brooklyn with no mask on?
