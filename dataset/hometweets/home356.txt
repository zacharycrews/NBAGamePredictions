DeVon, I seriously need you to pray for the health of the @chicagobulls. Ever since last Mondays game against Charlotte there's been a serious Covid outbreak with the team. 3 players being put into safety protocol in a week. Covid is trying to ruin everything for them. 🙏Covid needs to leave the @chicagobulls alone.@chicagobulls Gonna be tough without Demar for a week or however long the Covid protocol lasts.@chicagobulls @BMOHarrisBank Pistons games@chicagobulls BULLS GONNA LOSE WITH ALL THEIR PLAYERS ACTIVE 😂😂 FRAUDSPOTD Chicago Bulls - 2 2U@FusionKingAli @ShamsCharania Why would the league want Philly in over Chicago 😂 terrible take.

When the Bulls are good, the NBA is better.Wild move and probably too late for admin stuff, but I'd sign Gelo to a two-hour contract with the Chicago Bulls and let Lonzo figure out how to use him in that one game.. 😅

I’m just disappointed because the white sox were also decimated like this so it’s very frustrating to see#BREAKING Per @ShamsCharania: @chicagobulls star @DeMar_DeRozan has entered #COVID19 health and safety protocols and is out against the @nuggets. DeRozan could miss several games in protocols.

Lol AK can make something work.@albator @YoungJordan @chicagobulls Coby does need time for sure and I guess if he comes back and balls out that’ll definitely attract interest that AKME may use for a trade or may even decide to keep.I wouldn’t want coby traded so not sure how it’ll pan out.I’m intrigued though.@_jphwang @chicagobulls He was above league-average efficiency in his last two Spurs seasons as well! I think the idea of him as an inefficient scorer is now officially outdated@YoungJordan @27_blake @chicagobulls Problem is they have no value. Only Coby and Pat do. Pat being injured means he’s not going anywhere. Coby needs time and if he’s dealt it’d most certainly be at the deadline anyways so see how he plays with this group for more than just a couple of games. Blazers pick could help@bulls_nikki @chicagobulls 😏Get your Chicago Bulls shot glass ready for tonight. 🙌🏾🙌🏼
#BullsNation@YoungJordan @albator @chicagobulls I’m in agreement P-Dubs is our future and coby is that shooter from the bench we need in rotation for sure.I’m a big coby fan so defo wouldn’t want him to go but I’m interested in what AKME May do.Could be ruthless with it!DasHaus made a bet!
