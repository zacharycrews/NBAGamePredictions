Hustle points, cuts, rebounds, etc. 

Similar to Draymond Green's production for GS. We'd see the best Randle if this was his assignment on a night to night basis.@suzie_mae @nyknicks @warriors Go NY go NY gooooooooooooo!@Schmeelk @giantswfan 

I think Steph is will knock down 10+ 3s tonight at MSG. He‚Äôs due for a a HUGE game and with the record being 1 away and him playing in New York I think he‚Äôs on his way to 40-50 point performance

New York Knicks - Golden State Warriors

Julius Randle O9.5 Rebounds @ 1.90 ($100)

Got 10&amp;14 in the L2 games. Hit the over in last 7 games v. GSW. Warriors efficiency poor lately, so lots of chances for boards.

That's not to say things would be better--he has a horrible plus-minus. It's only to say that he's NOT the problem.

However, think Knicks fans biggest issues have been sharpness, hustle &amp; turnovers, FTs &amp; mental lapses 

Could of focused on 15/10/4 w 1/2 blocks/steals - playing well w Obi / improving youth = King of NY@BucketsDoc @RobertJ0301 @NBA_NewYork That was the whole point of kemba &amp; fournier. It hasnt worked so knicks are struggling to find the help. i love RJ but he was terrible for a month if he played like he is lately we wouldn‚Äôt be in this position. Fournier too our record when he scores 18 plus is great.@RCtweeted @StephenCurry30 @nyknicks Lmao I agree but Kerr said in his press conference day 1 we gonna be chasing regular season wins so here we are .. I felt Steph ran out of gas in the play in so here we go ‚Ä¶ we just need some other guys to step up and stop watching the show sheehs cmon Wiggs@MikeNairne @birdingdude @KnicksCentral @nyknicks To fix this, I'm arguing that the front office needs to delegate the offensive schemes to an assistant coach that specializes in schematics in order to maximize our personnel.

An example would be Mike D'Antoni's role within New Jersey last season.ALERT: New high roller bet posted!

My argument is that because of outdated schemes, Randle is used incorrectly, which leads to poor shot selection.

#DubNation #NewYorkForever #NBATwitter
https://t.co/YcDHZCJetcI‚Äôve watched nearly every @nyknicks game and every Warriors game this season. The Dubs are great but really small in the front court. Randall, Mitch, Noel and even Sims (if he plays) should get down to the block and take advantage. #knicks@THTRBW @nyknicks @TheGarden Both are MVP winners no?@StephenCurry30 please I‚Äôm begging you, don‚Äôt break the record tonight against the @nyknicks. Knicks fans have suffered enough. We really don‚Äôt need another highlight reel put up against us. Every time I watch you play I wish we could have drafted you.@alanhahn Hey Alan my son is a die hard @nyknicks fan and I was wondering if he could intern for you? He does so much research and knows everything about the Knicks.I'm a single father and retired from NYC sanitation . If he interns for you I will be your personal driver for freeTo stay up for the @warriors Vs @nyknicks game or sleep and wake up? As I stay up kuna EPL makes everything easier.New York Knicks Last 10 games: 3 Win 7 Lost  (PF)103.3 - (PA)108.5 #Knicks  Full odds at https://t.co/nUn5OcMhOI@nyknicks @StephenCurry30 @NBA what if the NY Knicks went in and took Mr. 3-ball in 2009 instead of Mr.  Jordan Hill.

Bet slip link: https://t.co/GU9x0BnMGc https://t.co/VS4U5iRFFi@NBA_NewYork Other stars? Who's already a star on the Knicks? You guys are pumping up Randle way too much. Just because he had a top 15 season, doesn't make him a top 15 guy in the league. I get your passion but other stars aren't currently lining up to play with Julius Randle.@nyknicks To think the Knicks once had a frontline that included Mase, Charles Oakley and Xavier McDaniel. 
No one left the paint without some black and blues.If I was on the Knicks i would have a dedicated defender for Steph Curry. He don‚Äôt even have to look to score just run around and make it hard as possible for him to get that record. 

If the @nyknicks wanna establish an identity tonight‚Äôs the night to do it.@DameFrmLI @nyknicks @TheGarden Who's your best defender u can't have 1 guy on curry hell run around 3 screens and get open eventually I think this game he drops over 40 atleast with the blazers they triple teamed him@NBA_NewYork No star is going to want to come to the Knicks if the Knicks dump Randle after some bad games.  Stars know how NY is by seeing what fans did to Ewing, Marbury, Carmelo, etc. when they couldn't pull miracles out their butts and lead low talented teams to anything.Steph Curry likely breaking Ray Allen‚Äôs record against the @nyknicks in @TheGarden tonight.
