But now we have a disciplinarian coach, but with none of the X-O/strategic acumen. Frustrating.@celtics @jaytatum0 But the percentages..🤦🏻‍♀️@celtics @jaytatum0 Fake stats.

Clint Capela, Bogdan Bogdanovic, Trae Young, DeAndre Hunter all have missed a significant number of games. The only starter, and he's currently out, to be fairly healthy is Collins.

#Clippers #Celtics@JayGamTrey @celticslife @celtics @danielrainge I would love for Brad to somehow get a top end all-star PG in a trade or free agency to play with Tatum and Brown before he splits Tatum and Brown up. A great PG would make things so much better and easier on JT and JB.@BleacherReport @ShamsCharania What are you doing Brad @celticsAm I watching the @Celtics game today? 🤔 Not sure.
