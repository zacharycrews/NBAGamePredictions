Nice seeing more milwaukee gear out there. Felt like when I walk around Green Bay it was odd seeing a bucks Jersey now I see them all the timeKevin Greeley,  Kentucky graduate, 1975,  would be a  3 point goal threat in today’s game.  Born too soon.  He did have a 10 career in the NBA with the Washington Bullets and Milwaukee Bucks.  PS:  Chris Ford,  Villanova graduate made the 1st 3 point goal in the NBA.Meanwhile, the Milwaukee Bucks have been in a rut as they’ve lost four of their last five games overall and they will be hoping to avoid a third straight defeat after getting stopped by the Nets in a 126-123 home loss on Saturday. 🤕

Same with the hornets. 

It might not make sense to you but it makes sense to me. 

One turnover an i wanna take a baseball bat to the television. https://t.co/GkNLWiKDZT@joe_sheehan @scott_pianowski In the NFL, the Cincinnati Bengals can matter about as much as anyone. NBA markets stars, so the Milwaukee Bucks are not only good but on TV all the time. The Tampa Bay Rays can be 90-40 and the msm convo will be "how does this affect the Yankees?"The Greek Freak🦌🦌🦌

Big body, but excellent agile😲😲

🟩🟩🟩🟩🟩The Hornets played an OT game tonight and have to travel to Milwaukee so naturally they will shoot the lights out tomorrow night and beat the Bucks.. https://t.co/GBwl1yeG6AMilwaukee Bucks, Donald Ducks, Hockey pucks, I don’t give a fuck, Heat in 5. https://t.co/YuMF1AEsNm@riqcoelee @RealSkipBayless Sixers beat the Bucks right before the AS break in Milwaukee, but after the trade and no one batted an eyelash. They did it with no Harden and no Seth or Drummond who were already in BK. Nets did it last night and now everyone on the bandwagon?Yikes...just got home in time to see this. These are the games that good teams just dont lose...

At home vs a bad team...now gotta fly to Milwaukee to face Giannis and the Bucks after a overtime loss...

This team is lost, rudderless and some of the blame has to go to coaching. https://t.co/qteQbnM83VAfter their latest loss, the Milwaukee Bucks have been more "pretender" than "contender" in 2022.

https://t.co/9LjsxZDeZwThey head in to Milwaukee to play the #Bucks tomorrow. The #Nets were similarly struggling on their way into Fiserv Forum. https://t.co/DA4NeCugipa milwaukee bucks jersey actually https://t.co/R7YrqqjZpR@ZachGelb @1250AMTheFan @4thBase1 @WinksThinks Howed you like Milwaukee. Bucks, Packers, Brewers, Badgers? And our radio crew. We@BallsackSports Ask Karl Malone how that worked out for him. Not saying you gotta win multiple rings, but no denying what getting 1 ring did for Giannis’ legacy as a Milwaukee Buck. This also sounds like Dame is okay with the fact that he may never win one. Fans wanna hear that from him?@TrolledByKawhi @mordecai381 @JWBx93 @Bucks 2-1 against Brooklyn this season and 1-1 against Philadelphia🥱 don’t think either of them own Milwaukee@Bucks @Giannis_An34 This Milwaukee players juss have a whole different vibe@ashleypriyanka @notlyssa So me being a Milwaukee Bucks and a Green Bay Packers fan is a red flag according to the original tweet?@HenrySanchez No OG for either game by the way. Did anyone think we’d beat the Bucks in Milwaukee? Crazier things have happened.
