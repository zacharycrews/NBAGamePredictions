📺 NBA LEAGUE PASSIf you told me 10 years ago I’d be rushing to get home so that I can catch the Charlotte Hornets game I’d not only thank god they switched back from the Bobcats, but also tell you to gtfoh#Celtics will Dennis Schröder in place of Al Horford (injured/thigh), along with Marcus Smart, Jaylen Brown, Jayson Tatum &amp; Robert Williams III in Charlotte.

#Hornets #AllFlyTonight's starting lineup for the Charlotte Hornets: Ball, Oubre, Hayward, Bridges, Plumlee https://t.co/bVWH4Av1bsA tall order for YOUR 3-0 Charlotte Hornets tonight

No PJ Washington, No Terry rozier 

It will be interesting to see if JB plays any of the young centers (Richards, Carey Jr, or Kai) 

Expect alot of 

 Ball/Oubre/Hayward/Bridges/Plumlee@Branderprise @jimmiGotDaJuice @MercenaryBets Celtics should be winning this, both teams on b2b and both have had to travel back to Charlotte, hornets being overvalued just because they’re 3-0 while Celtics should have enough fire power to keep their momentum riding after a much needed W vs the RocketsI guess he’s not wrong if you only count their recent time as the Charlotte Hornets. Six years ago they were the Bobcats. And that team had quite a history of a “multi-year tank job.” But that must have been longer ago than this guy has been following the NBA. Only explanation. https://t.co/rMT851IJXt1st game starts 40 min

The Hornets wouldn't be doing well in GS didn't over think the draft and draft LaMelo.

Keep quiet manthis is actually a perfect example of how obsurd the "all tanking is bad" belief system is.  

The Charlotte Hornets have been a putrid franchise for a majority of the last 2 decades....and a lot of it is because they kept trying to compete without the ability to do so. https://t.co/7f4ZucDPkI@AlchemyINTZ @NBA @StephenCurry30 @warriors @MilesBridges @hornets Bridges also has 2.7 spg@RevPaulRevere the Charlotte Hornets Starter jacket didn't become a collectors' item to this day for the disrespect shown in the quoted Tweet.@BunionsSaul @CebolaDosHolnet @hornets @CrumblCookies bridges, lamelo, graham, pj, they all played a lot of minutes so the development argument doesn't really fit.@hatingkimani24 @celtics @hornets @NBCSBoston @985TheSportsHub Good one bud lemme guess your still in middle school ?Boston Celtics at Charlotte Hornets  Game #4   10/25/21 https://t.co/nb96xt8Wn2@hornets @MilesBridges And yes it is gold!! https://t.co/rcSNKbEPXgthe Oklahoma City Thunder have finished below .500 one time since 2009
