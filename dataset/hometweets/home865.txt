I love CJ McCollum on the New Orleans Pelicans.Losing by 30 to the New Orleans Basketball Pelicans is nasty. But the Raps deserve some slack after the run they had. Had like 6-8 guys playing a very compact schedule and looked amazing for weeksCJ McCollum (13 FGAs) was the only Pelicans player to attempt 10 or more shots tonight. 10 players had at least 1 assist. The entire starting lineup had at least 4 assists. 

Ball movement was A-1 for New Orleans.Raptors lose yet again, embarrassed by New Orleans Pelicans 120-90. Bad team shows its true colours tonight. #HomerismNeverPays #DontLetDumblinBrainwashYouWithHisBaloney@PelicansNBA I love the New Orleans Pelicans basketball organizationAnother example of New Orleans' great defense: Pelicans have held Raptors to only 4 fastbreak points.

They average 15.4. That's 3rd best in the league.

If this sticks over remaining 3 minutes of action, it'll mark Toronto's 2nd-lowest output in a game this season.WHY ARE WE LOSINNG BY 3,340 TO THE NEW ORLEANS PELICANS!?The Cavs followed this big formula all the way to a top 4 seed in the conference.
