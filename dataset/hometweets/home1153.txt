#Pistons @ #Thunder  - win win https://t.co/xEr6ctPOlP@blocksnbooze Yeah they had swagger, but they weren't a good team particularly. The Houston rockets play with a lot of pace and swagger but are the borderline worst team in the league. It all takes one win, one solid, confidence boosting win, to rekindle the flame. When you have talent likeA great #NBA Handicapping angle to consider is betting against a team that won the first game in a back-2-back situation against the same team. The #Kings just beat the #Rockets. Tonight the @HoustonRockets get revenge.
