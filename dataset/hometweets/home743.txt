Cleveland is impressive but they’ll lose some ground. Look at Brooklyn and Milwaukee.  Both 20-loss teams. Hornets just need to get Gordon and Kelly back. They’re hitting their stride right now.Early hoops for your Sunday 🙌

#AllFly | @hornets https://t.co/xEGJQyrgZS@KyleBaileyClub @hornets @LAClippers Cleveland (despite multiple injuries) refuses to lose ground; it appears that the top 6 teams will stay there barring anything crazy. Our new goal should be to lock that 7 seed to increase our odds of advancing past just the play-in10 minutes to tip on Kids Day at the Hive!

@ashahahmadi and @WesGotRange look back at who all stepped up in the big win against the Lakers on Friday.

#AllFly | @hornets https://t.co/c66ZUxhRGyToday's starting lineup for the Charlotte Hornets: Ball, Rozier, Martin, Bridges, Plumlee https://t.co/bVWH4AMCA2Today is a battle of two teams in 7th place but in wildly different positions.

@Hornets are 7th in the East, 4-games back of 1st.

@LAClippers are 7th in the West, 15.5 games back of 1st.

Safe to say the Eastern Conference is loaded with competition. #AllFly https://t.co/1PyIy6YNmg1/30

Coach probably not liking how he's moving on the ankle.@HornetsPR @hornets Sigh@latimessports Gordon Hayward is out for the Hornets and Kelly Oubre Jr. is questionable (re-evaluated after warm-ups) but Charlotte will still feature the flamethrowing backcourt of LaMelo + Terry Rozier today

Clips likely hoping Reggie Jackson can bust out of mini-slump, 8.7 ppg over last 3INJURY REPORT vs LAC

Kelly Oubre Jr. (L Ankle Sprain) is out. 
Jalen McDaniels (L Ankle Sprain) is out.
Gordon Hayward (H&amp;S Protocols) is out.

#AllFly | @NovantHealth https://t.co/cQT3hcck5lUPDATE: @hornets reserve Kelly Oubre (L Ankle Sprain) has been downgraded from questionable to out for today's game against the LA Clippers #AllFly https://t.co/2SEjFJpUuA@WarriorsIsOn @DrewHill_DM Charlotte is nice but they aren’t nearly as exciting on the defensive end and they’re als just not nearly as good as the grizzlies. The Grizz put up plays vs the leagues top teams. The Hornets do it against the mid-pack teams. There’s levels to this.@qc_javi @MELOD1P @hornets @CrownClubCLT @melod1p you Gang Gang now@benhuncc You realize the Charlotte hornets were trash under the same damn coach and then y’all got a generational talent at point guard….and some of the decisions he makes deserve scrutiny… like the defensive subs in late game situations….the  extended minutes on the bench…PHIL'S PROP BET GUARANNNTEEE 💯💯

To the naysayers, he can actually lead the team. Nevermind the loss, what we saw was true grit.Charlotte is without McDaniels and Hayward today, with Oubre questionable.  If Kelly sits, the Hornets are still going to have a very good starting lineup but the bench starts to be suspect.Going to be giving away a pair of seats for some upcoming @hornets games! Must be following to enter/win!Some matchup rankings headed into Clippers at Charlotte for Sunday morning.

Yes, the last time these teams met, Clippers overcame a 13-point deficit.

Additionally Lamelo had shot better than magic on more attempts.@steve18955012 @anselbrown @MagicJohnson @Lakers @hornets That's not how it works though. It's a team game. If you want to just stack up talents, then the Lakers will be undefeated since nobody has more talent.Charlotte Hornets sit at the 7seed currently just a few weeks out of the 2021-22 All Star break. Their best 2021-22 trade deadline candidate who they SHOULD and COULD shop is PJ Washington. Yes, this isn’t exactly obvious. Why? He’s up for an extension #NBA #CharlotteHornetsListen to the most recent episode of my podcast: Episode 276: Coach Mike Dunlap (Assistant Coach for the Milwaukee Bucks/Former Head Coach Charlotte Hornets) "Becoming a Master Teacher" https://t.co/l4paCBbjFBCharlotte Hornets forward Miles Bridges discussed the hate Russell Westbrook gets after he dropped 35 points for the L.A. Lakers.  https://t.co/uqSCcrMlun@DeanScorpion_ Bron fans are still paranoid of the owner of the Charlotte hornets and it's gonna be amusing for many years to come@KYGinger @Grant_Marek Ah, for my area it was Charlotte Hornets - which not a single person who wore watched at all.@GambleLikeMe This team is so much fun!!! I have never know a winning NBA in Charlotte!  I was to young to really enjoy the first go around with the Hornets.

RW needs a team to lead. He’s not a role player person.

LAL needs shooters! I’m a LAL fan! From what I’ve seen so far this season including preseason games, this team isn’t going anywhere, unless they quickly upgrade d defense. It’s a bad team now. Russ’ trade is a big mistake. LAL needs a PG that can shoot &amp; defend.@DianneG @hornets Thank you so much!!!!@HornetsOnBally @CBJspanberg @hornets It was great to watch them (on ESPN) last night…..@holy_shucks @Jgoss73 @ZionBeasleytbg @Et3rnalOptimist @stephenasmith @Lakers @hornets @russwest44 @KingJames @AntDavis23 ExactlyWatch Los Angeles Lakers guard Russell Westbrook explode for a season-high 35 points against the Charlotte Hornets.  https://t.co/zfkHAP6VSl@KingJames Please apologize again for losing to Charlotte Hornets! @Lakers @LakersNation @LosLakers @LakersReporter @MarkG_Medina@DonCornelius70 @hornets @Lakers @Canes @NJDevils Last time the arena went over capacity was vs Washington this season at 18,815 but before that, the last they went over was in the 2019 playoffs with multiple going over 19k/r/CharlotteHornets: Gameday for our mini-Bonkers!

Hornets have sent a lot of players there to get some minutes this year (Bouknight, Thor, Kai Jones, Vernon Carey Jr.).  In years past, seen Graham, Bacon, Marin twins, McDaniels.@HornetsOnBally @hornets Remember when the only person that could make a basket was Kemba? Wow Mitch been putting in work.@CelebsInCLT @Lakers @hornets Would have been same results no matter who played.@andrewhicksnc @greensboroswarm @jam3s210 @hornets Beginning and end of the manufacturing time. So somewhere in that time period. Thanks for looking. We live in Raleigh and go to a handful of Hornets games, maybe we can go see the Swarm and do half the driving.@Nckirkpatrick @greensboroswarm @jam3s210 @hornets These are dated 05/22/13 on the left side and 10/10/13 on the right.  Looks like yours has 2 different dates too.  Why are there 2 dates?Does the @hornets organ player always play Super Mario World Ghost Town theme song during games?

#AllFly@stephenasmith @Lakers @hornets @russwest44 @KingJames @AntDavis23 We always knew who Russ was, but he needs to do this with #Ad &amp; #LeBronJames , a true superstar can, it's not as if he doesn't have the ball. I believe in Russ but it's a Team concept.@stephenasmith @Lakers @hornets @russwest44 @KingJames @AntDavis23 Big Three Refs of @Lakers tried to bag it for LAL but #westbrick prevailed.

Lol @russwest44 brick? #whyNot@BrianGoben @stephenasmith @Lakers @hornets @russwest44 @KingJames @AntDavis23 You really thought you said something here@TheNeuOne @hornets The offense isn’t the problem. I see too much wing depth (use it for trade options). A lack of rim protection depth. Overlapping miniature guards. As a Knicks fan, I have no ties to Borrego who looks like the coach before the coach. https://t.co/o0XdjdfJR7
