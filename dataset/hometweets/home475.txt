The team was great, though I totally hated them because I was a huge Jazz fan back then.A lot of people wondered if Rudy &amp; Hassan could co-exist ...

A little C.O.D. (and a LOT of desire to be great later), the two centers are thriving together.

You know where to find us if you’re looking for a little more off-the-beaten-path style of epic outdoor adventure.  😉The Utah Jazz EFG% is 56.7 that is the 3rd best of all time

last year Brooklyn Nets and the 17-18 Golden State Warriors are the only better shooting teams in NBA history@BrentTate13 @RealMcKoye @utahjazz Brotha you’re too kind my guy. Love you man@cassypalisades @utahjazz Exactly.#NBA Overnight Best Bets:
12.22.2021

🏀 Utah Jazz -10.5 (-115) 3u
🏀 Spurs +1.5 (-110) 1u

I feel very strong about the Jazz tomorrow. No Edwards, Beverley, or Vanderbilt for the Wolves + Gobert will be able to contain KAT.

Small market teams have no choice and pay a lot more.Put Gobert in L.A or Miami &amp; probably could get him cheaper because promotional stuff sales is way more important@HardenLover69 His playmaking was crazy looking at it straight up, but considering turnovers and his opponent being the round 1 utah jazz.... im def taking cp3, nash, bron, and magic over him at least@CardPurchaser Just one today, but some goodies this week.

Congratulations. Hope the future is bright and full of great surprises.See this is where we're different. I want to win all the championships. I want those other teams to form a new league that excludes the Utah Jazz because they're so tired of losing all the time. Even one more non championship season is too many. https://t.co/QRWm6pdRep@utahjazz thanks for the Experience! https://t.co/DC3U7DOqi9@RealMcKoye @elars777 should be gifted these if he can make it.
