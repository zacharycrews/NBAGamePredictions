https://t.co/nPpK95C8EJ#Kings @ #Pelicans

New Orleans isn't great. Kings are half-decent and got nice fantasy lines from 4 starts and Hield. So, the usual, kinda, for both teams, actually.

JV's been unreal. If you can move him for a 2nd rounder, do it. Otherwise probably just ride the wave.👍 on @YouTube: LIVE Sacramento Kings @ New Orleans Pelicans POSTGAME - Presented by Royal Rebounds https://t.co/ifDaRzHmzxNBA

New Orleans is a hair under 40% on FGs and only has 8 ast on 24 basketsIf we redo the 2019 NBA draft, Ja Morant should go No. 1 over New Orleans Pelicans forward Zion Williamson.

Through five games of the NBA season Ja Morant is averaging a career best in points per game, 3P%, eFG%, and TS%. https://t.co/vmL3BNnbHGKings with a 59-48 halftime lead over the Pelicans in New Orleans, their largest lead of the game. Seven 3's already for Sacramento, shooting 55% from the floor. Richaun Holmes &amp; Harrison Barnes with 12 points each.Kings lead the Pelicans 33-26 after 1st in New Orleans. De'Aaron Fox aggressive early with 9 points for Sacramento shooting 67%, Brandon Ingram 8 points for Pels shooting 44%New Orleans does not care about the Pelicans. Tons of empty seats....same thing against the Hawks a few nights ago as wellOn one hand, I feel bad for Pelicans fans to have to deal with constant chatter about Zion leaving New Orleans.

On the other, there are always a lot of empty seats when I watch a Pelicans home game.Match: New Orleans Pelicans - Sacramento Kings
