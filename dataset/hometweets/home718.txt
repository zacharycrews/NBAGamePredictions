Big 3 all out for Brooklyn. Look for a healthy Denver team that has won 3 of its last 4 to dominate against a depleted Nets team.Update to the Status Report for tonight's game vs. Denver:

Harden (left hamstring tightness) - OUT@LikeHarden @JHarden13 idec if he stays in brooklyn man, i just want him to finally succeed.. but if the nets can’t do that, then he should leave. man’s been getting fucked over by bs way too many times. he should’ve won last year and look what happened, and now this year it got even more weird.. smhIf Kevin Durant doesn't come back soon, that Brooklyn Nets team is going to go into full drop off mode

They have the 7th hardest schedule and only 3 games out of 7th spot.

Harden is also out tonight and Kyrie playing every 2 games is roughWoj says the public comments of Brooklyn’s Big Three matches their internal optimism.

“When (Kevin Durant, James Harden, &amp; Kyrie Irving are) together, they believe they’re unstoppable.”

Getting that trio on the court — together — remains the biggest roadblock to a Nets title. https://t.co/OgAS4imAsR@BrooklynNets time for a new head coach… and let Kyrie play. It cost pennies compared to what you scums are making a game to let him play https://t.co/aF0FiaVCll@rjbree @KnicksCentral Lmfao the Brooklyn Nets didn’t exist like a decade ago.

Harden, reportedly, has several laments: Brooklyn itself, for starters (he’s “not enjoying it,” according to Bleacher Report). Nash’s rotation is reportedly “disappointing.” And Kyrie Irving’s part-time status is allegedly “frustrating.”

Everyone thank Kyrie Irving and Nets organization for there dismantling of one of the best three ever.  Only Golden State knows how to many 3 superstars. IT IS OVER!@sportswatch Whether in Jersey or Brooklyn, whether with scrubs or stars, the Nets are somehow always going to play second fiddle around here to the bumbling Knicks. Whereas the country as a whole understandably doesn't care about Thibs' rotations and likes the Nets' stars.I love that Canberra has produced two headlining world sports stars so cool, yet so different in @NickKyrgios and @Patty_Mills.

Pack your backs and get the hell out of Nets organization.  That organization is dysfunctional.Brooklyn is no longer the Home for the Nets, Brooklyn is a neutral site@BrooklynNets The game to night is at home, so Kyrie Irving won’t be playing.  If I was Harden I won’t play either, because Kyle Irving isn’t hurt and doesn’t want to be part of the team.  Nets will lose tonight too, because Kyrie Irving is choosing to sit out.

We have seen this story before mate Harden can't take the burden of carrying Nets he wanted that on KD and Kyrie.@BrooklynNets Nets ownership and GM are ridiculous. Holding on to a player who is part time. If I was Harden I would have been left.  I see why Lebron left Kyrie Irving, because he’s to much drama. One player should never be above the team. Hint (Kyrie Irving)@BrooklynNets This Nets team is finished the way it’s constructed.  Either trade Kyrie Irving or let him go.  Get another player to help Harden, before it’s to damn late.@BrooklynNets I see why Harden wants out of Brooklyn.  Kyrie won’t even help the team, and ownership keeps letting Kyrie Irving get his way like a baby.

That's why he can't be on the Lakers 1st Unit, but Reaves has value because he will do the dirty work.James Harden's days in Brooklyn Nets might be numbered.

He can't be a part time gamer. It is crazy to see and crazier to accept. Trade him asap.
Moreover, wtf is Nash doing? Harden playing without any help and he uses Cam for what?

He’s unhappy in Brooklyn and after a Knicks Nets game in Brooklyn he said there were more Knicks fans at the game than Nets fans. Clearly he sees that he is the team in NY that most fans don’t care about.@BrooklynNets Let me be very clear here.
The nets are a burst. I am a KD fan and I am really sorry for him right know.
Harden is playing all by himself, got any help, the team ain't well coached, the team can't defend, can't rebound. The franchise has to organize they ain't going anywhere.@LikeHarden @BrooklynNets The trade for Harden is the reason why the Nets roster is so bad. We gave up LeVert, Allen, Prince, couldn’t re sign Dinwiddie and lots of draft picks, and now Harden is not happy. Nets should trade him right now.

And in a way, that's the issue.

Just 16 games played w/ the big-3, and KD + Harris are out an extended period.

Next 3 months will be crucial for recovery and habit-building.@Lakers lets go we beat the @BrooklynNets@BrooklynNets @JHarden13 Deserve so much better than this. 😔😔😔. If the Rumors are true that he wants out. I can't even Blame him. The Nets are letting him die out there alone. Because they are too endowed to the Democratic party to pay the Fine and Let Kyrie Play. What a Shame.With AD back, the Los Angeles Lakers defeated the Brooklyn Nets. Is this the beginning of a change and a comeback to make it to the top? #Lakers #LakeShow  #believe  #NBA75 #NBA #NBATwitter #2k22All I’m saying @BrooklynNets, if y’all ever trade kyrie.

James Harden is playing with four teammates who can't shoot. James Harden is being double-teamed all the time, his teammates are missing shots and turning the ball over. Steve Nash didn't make any adjustments.Anthony Davis looked mostly great in his first game back in the lineup in over a month, helping the Lakers coast to a win over the Nets in Brooklyn.  @LakersSBN https://t.co/ue16kgB7rN@ElJBell1 @HopelesRealist In Brooklyn ..listening to the Nets announcers criticize the Lakers roster is priceless.

James Harden leads the game in scoring with 22. #introsports22 @DOrlandoLED@nba_paint @JHarden13 @BrooklynNets @NBAonTNT Aldrich underratedIt's much deeper than this, but the current version of the Brooklyn Nets can't lean on Bruce Brown.

22 points
7 rebounds
5 assists
9/18 shooting

Brooklyn trails LA 62-53 at the half. Gonna need much more from Mills and Aldridge in the 2nd half to make it a game.Obviously the rebounding has been an issue (11 Nets OREBs), but Lakers making up for that by being +11 in transition points and +5 in 3-pointers

Russ’ 4 TOs are not ideal, but no one else on the Lakers has any and they’ve forced 8 from Brooklyn@BrooklynNets We really got Carter and Johnson out on the floor over Cam and Sharpe, or even Blake lmao..@JAC0BDEGR0M @BrooklynNets are you watching the ga-- oh wait im talking to a Certified https://t.co/eFBmHbxt9t@BrooklynNets Free James Harden

Fxxk Kyrie@BrooklynNets I love you guys and kd@insectotheology @JoeTheGoatArdi @BrooklynNets Bro, quit box score watching 🤣@BrooklynNets Only down by nine I excepted worseNets trail the Lakers at half 62-53.

Harden is the all the Nets have tonight. None of his teammates can seem to do anything when he passes out of the double. Brooklyn going 2-14 on 3Ps and 8 TOVs not helping either.

Harden: 22/5/7
Aldridge: 9 PTS, 5 REBS
Mills: 5 PTS, 2-6 FGs@NBAonTNT commentators are 10000% CRINGE, SHALLOW and DRY—to say the least. Grateful for hearing @YESNetwork's #IanEagle guest appearance tonight !! 🤌👊 @BrooklynNets@BrooklynNets  I don’t understand how a basketball 🏀 organization can allow one player to hold them hostage.

James Harden has a near triple-double with a game-high 22 points, seven boards and five assists in 21 minutes — He’s scored or assisted on 14 of Brooklyn’s 22 made shots.

This Brooklyn team cannot do anything without James Harden on the floor. LAL went on an extended 19-6 run when he sat, going up by as much as 14 PTS.
