Stay the course w these guys@ATLHawks @MichelobULTRA Trade someone@willwilsxn @greater8888 @MIAxCT @TECTEY0N @SHAR1FECOOPER @ATLHawks Although he had been wanting to be out, I like his basketball and skills.

You saw how difficult it was for the Hawks to score late if Trae was off last in the playoffs.    Bucks had Middleton taking over the 4th when Giannis was off.    They need Trae and another in crunch time.@ATLHawks @HawksOnBally Some Ws would be nice@byst @ATLHawks Move over, Matt Ryan 😂😂😂@ATLHawks @HawksOnBally talkin bout ball movement…. post the ball movement on kvons inbound pass.

They was just playing hard because they was happy to get rid of Lloyd and after they got paid the show no effort. Nate sucks and we can't play defense Because we have a whole bunch of offensive specialist.@ATLHawks YALL GOTTA START LISTENING TO COLLINS IN THAT LOCKER ROOM HE MEANS WELL COME ON!!!@ATLHawks WE HAVE POTENTIAL TO WIN A CHAMPIONSHIP IF WE KEEP @jcollins20_ PLEASE DONT TRADE THIS MAN!!!@ATLHawks @HawksOnBally All highlights should be canceled until further noticeIn the 2nd game of a near back-to-back,@ATLHawks came closer,but @MiamiHEAT still came out on top:124-118.@JimmyButler had 23 pts on his return,@raf_tyler, 24.@OmerYurtseven5 has become a virtual #doubledouble machine, w/17 pts &amp; 11 rebounds.Tonite we face @sixers--@JoelEmbiid!! https://t.co/rnPXLKuXBh@ATLHawks @HawksOnBally Trade anyone not named DeAndre Hunter@ATLHawks @HawksOnBally do the hawks respond?@ATLHawks @HawksOnBally Nigga, we lostBall movement ➡️ buckets

Both teams just can’t get it together and need some good additions to pull them out of trouble@ATLHawks @socios Don’t care win a game@ATLHawks hero ball in crunch time is never the answer. The team was playing really good together. If you can sum how channel that from quarters 2, 3 and the 9 mins in the 4th. That would benefit the team@ATLHawks @jcollins20_ Atp y’all they don’t deserve him anymore@RedVelvetMelon @ATLHawks I don’t disagree but Huerter and Trae ARE REALLY BAD.  So having them on the floor at the same time with Galo makes it extremely tough to get a stop@MikeBellATL @ATLHawks Lmao! Every call on him was a foul. Were a couple ticky tack? Sure. Still the hawks shot more free throws so you can’t say it was the refs. They were equally as bad for both teams@ATLHawks @socios Trae get everyone going then you take over the forth@imoretull @MikeBellATL @ATLHawks ISO games don’t win…we’ve seen this movie before with ISO Joe@ATLHawks @socios Let's go Hawks, do it !!Game on the line late, who put the dagger in the @ATLHawks? 🤔 @JimmyButler Did It.

Coverage at 7e/6c with @mrvincecarter15 @Kelly_Crull @TreavorScales and @BrianOliver1313 on @HawksonBally!It took a little from a lot of guys, but the Miami Heat ultimately prevailed again against the Atlanta Hawks to win a seventh straight home game. Jimmy Butler and Tyler Herro made the big shots late. 

@EthanJSkolnick &amp; @GregSylvander review a gutsy win:

https://t.co/WbQlI6SOisThe funny thing about this clip is watching the same two "play around" in the Atlanta Hawks pregame warmup video https://t.co/GFQTZM25IS@MikeBellATL @ATLHawks It’s sad. Cam was a big part of my thoughts on the future but we have a great team but keep tripping up. It will get better. Too much talent to blow it up.@cwperkjr48 @ATLHawks Didn’t cam reddish request a trade ?@ATLHawks We are trash per usual@Zeke_Love @ATLHawks Talking almost every shot and not any other player really touched the ball that much down the stretch….hero ball all day every day….Watched the interview with Atlanta Hawks GM Travis Schlenk yesterday and he was open and expansive on the team and the trade. And interestingly, there was not a single mention of Kevin Knox -- all about Cam and the draft pick.😤🔥💪 what a HUGE win to start this 5 game home stand vs the #AtlantaHawks to beat the #Hawks to get to 27-15 on the season! LETS GO #HEAT! #HEATCULTURE https://t.co/OuedNRggXcHere's your "ETB Sports Minute" with @NickWritesWords. The @nyknicks traded for @ATLHawks: @camreddish, @solohill and 2025

Trae is good player but not a student of the game,  not yet. Deandre actually has a higher iq than trae.The Miami Heat defeat the Atlanta Hawks 124-118 off of 24 points from Tyler Herro. #ATLatMIA https://t.co/vJ7ERTihsVTyler Herro scored 24 points, including a pair of go-ahead free throws with 46 seconds left, to help the Miami Heat to a 124-118 win over the visiting Atlanta Hawks, extending their winning streak to four games. https://t.co/Z85lohFc5LTyler Herro scored 24 points, including a pair of go-ahead free throws with 46 seconds left, to help the Miami Heat to a 124-118 win over the visiting Atlanta Hawks, extending their winning streak to four games. https://t.co/6uYayemil6@ATLHawks It's alright hawk fans, maybe after Trae retires or gets traded, you can win a ringHow you don’t call plays to get you players easier looks at the basket something in the paint Collins and Hunter was hot tonight #atlantahawks https://t.co/UgMuMyMl2uJimmy Butler returns to the Heat line-up with a 124-118 win over Atlanta Hawks! 🤩🔥

Thanks guys@ill_outsmart_ya @BigMoneyATL @ATLHawks For real! Every time he goes to the bench, our lead just disappear. And it's impressive how we let the game turn upside-down. Hunter came back really good tho, but that's what u said above, Trae doesn't pass the ball so much because almost anyone helps him@ChachereMl @BigMoneyATL @ATLHawks Yea read the Thread I mentioned what I thought about that last 3 mins from him. When Dre got the rebound I was hoping he would take the shot but he passed it out to trae and Trae was awful. Then The Next Two plays was Turnovers after a Block and a Charge.@ATLHawks there will be no 2nd half surge.....you all just truly suck ......if ppg were spread around you'd be slightly up.  .......but damn.  .   You guys super suck@ATLHawks Joke of a franchiseThe Atlanta Hawks are 14-0 all time when I attend their games….

You will not be traded!@F0RKKN1FE @Reynald03003553 @ATLHawks Weren’t@F0RKKN1FE @Reynald03003553 @ATLHawks Fuck it we went gonna play himWe played with a lot of effort tonight I’m not mad at the loss @ATLHawks@hugoluiz_11 @BigMoneyATL @ATLHawks I also think Nate Let him rest so long that the lead just evaporated. Hunter was pretty good tonight tho and I thought he would've been able to have a few easy shots but he passed the ball out to Trae and he didn't let anyone touch the ball much in those last 3 mins.@ill_outsmart_ya @BigMoneyATL @ATLHawks Yeah bro. We have so many turnovers every fucking game, we have no defense, no willpower, we miss wide-open buckets. Trae went really bad on 4th quarter. I'm done bro, my patience is over@tylervsthewrld @ATLHawks Get ready for another first round sweepThe Atlanta Hawks are going NOWHERE without Cam Reddish. #Atlanta@HoodieMooney @NBA @ATLHawks @MiamiHEAT Vote for Butler 🤝 Vote for Demar@ill_outsmart_ya @BigMoneyATL @ATLHawks Trae plays too much hero ball and normally we say he needs help, but he had Dre tonight.@ATLHawks We never do@Reynald03003553 @lnfernoGhost @ATLHawks bogi jalen johnson and 2 firstsAtlanta Hawks players can choose to tank this season, but I know one thing, they're all going to play to beat the Knickerbockers Tomorrow. The Atlanta Hawks will have to play as a team for all 4 quarters, like they did in the first 3 quarters in Miami. No other way around it💯And damn all these moral victories. Damn that, it’s way too much money on this roster to be talking about moral victories. I ain’t that kinda fan @ATLHawks .@hugoluiz_11 @BigMoneyATL @ATLHawks The Charge is just a good play but I didn't like him taking that 3 but there was enough time after that and it was still tied. Honestly I hate the Turnovers more than anything and the fact that he didn't dive for the ball after the turnover. He was awful in the last 3 mins tho.@lnfernoGhost @ATLHawks Haha. Pass@ATLHawks Dre is UNTOUCHABLE@MikeBellATL @ATLHawks only watched the last 3:34 w/ the game tied. There was some bad play on both ends. I did see Trae make 4 bad plays to 1 decent play (2 FT's) and the Heat scored the final 8 pts. 
Not gonna win many games when your best player folds in the final minutes.@HometeamBleak @ATLHawks Getting Capela back sooner rather than later will help tremendously.@MikeBellATL @ATLHawks Can we please get a Shooting guard that can score more than 7pts. Clanking 3’s with the game on the line. No athleticism to get to the rim. Get Bogey out of here….please!Someboday has got to play some defense! This shit is ridiculous!!! @ATLHawks #bruh #JohnCollins #NBAAllStar #TraeYoung@ATLHawks respect Gallinari@ATLHawks Trash 😂😂😂@ATLHawks Heat poured one out in Q1.
