Makes for awesome gift. https://t.co/CZKFmuwgKOThe reason Sergiño Dest was wearing a Chicago Bulls Basketball Jersey at Messi's Farewell event was because He was not aware that it was taking place that day. Infact they had to pick him straight from the beach where He had gone to relax.

I’ll revisit this in a year.@chicagobulls @LiquiMolyUSA guys I’ve come from the future to say that Demar is gonna score 40@chicagobulls @SamSmithHoops @Stacey21King The Jokes I want to make... Oral History... Respect to the legend !⚪️ DeMar DeRozan 30+ Points + Chicago Bulls Win (+210)

DeMar has been absolutely cooking, scoring 45, 38, 36 in his last 3 games. Hitting this line in 10 of his last 12 games, Averaging 33.1 Points per game in those 12.

Total of 240

#GamblingTwitter #NBAPicks https://t.co/xkBg5MiY9Q@MitchGoudreau @CashmereStar @J_Rich1 Could probably have made it a 3 way trade with the Bulls, sending Schroder to Chicago, Troy Brown Jr. &amp; Dozier to SA (keeping JRich), used the Thompson TPE to get Theis and held onto Bol Bol just to see how he looks next year if healthy. But the owners are insanely cheap.@cyilcal @chicagobulls @NBCSChicago @670TheScore No he’s not but he is a power forward lmfao and he’s better than most you could get on the trade block🎙 "KA-BOOM!"

Tomorrow night we honor Bulls broadcast legend Neil Funk.

The guys on the team want him and are giddy for him, Lonzo, and Caruso to return.The problem isn't the Bulls failing to make a deal but trading away Wendell Carter Jr. and Daniel Gafford and a chance to draft Franz Wagner.  Who would you rather have, them or Nikola Vucevic? https://t.co/K7I8Yvpt2n #ChicagoBulls #WendellCarterJr #DanielGafford #FranzWagner@Doug_Thonus @JuniperScribe @Bulls_Peck @MokenaLotClean @LegionHoops @BullsCentralYT @NBCSBulls @chicagobulls His per36 as a rookie are 12/6/2 and he was 19. It’s really not a stretch to think he could improve a little more as a starter. Jerami grant has a longer track record of not being a guy though. He is shining on a pistons team that just picked 1st overall, meaning they have zilch@RickSim03277286 @JuniperScribe @Bulls_Peck @MokenaLotClean @LegionHoops @BullsCentralYT @NBCSBulls @chicagobulls At any rate, it doesn't matter now.  I was in the "go for it" camp, but we probably still would have fallen short.  The "hedge your bets" camp is fine with me too.  I don't hate it or anything.  It's reasonable.@chicagobulls Wtf are these jerseys? They suck@Qman312 @lborom_ @chicagobulls This is what a winner looks like. Get your bread up before you call anyone cheap while you’re betting $10 to win 40 😂 https://t.co/okVoeLQHrY@RickSim03277286 @JuniperScribe @Bulls_Peck @MokenaLotClean @LegionHoops @BullsCentralYT @NBCSBulls @chicagobulls If there was a trade to be made, it was DJJ + Pat for Grant.  What chemistry does Pat have with anyone?  Absolutely none.  DJJ is going to miss most of the rest of the season and is a bench guy who will be gone at seasons end.@Doug_Thonus @JuniperScribe @Bulls_Peck @MokenaLotClean @LegionHoops @BullsCentralYT @NBCSBulls @chicagobulls It’s a nothing move that potentially breaks up the chemistry. Was this a 1 for 1 trade? Usually trades aren’t like that.@nywolforg Does this mean that the @Timberwolves will be the @chicagobulls tonight?@RickSim03277286 @JuniperScribe @Bulls_Peck @MokenaLotClean @LegionHoops @BullsCentralYT @NBCSBulls @chicagobulls If you really think they can win the finals this year, then swapping out a guy like Pat, who may give you absolutely 0 this year and certainly won't give you a ton, for a quality starting player at your weakest position seems like a really good idea.@Qman312 @lborom_ @chicagobulls I forgot the 'K' in a sentence you already comprehended… strike two for mad twitter boy! Would you like to go for a third? Or would you prefer to go feed your gambling habit that you are clearly garbage at?@RickSim03277286 @JuniperScribe @Bulls_Peck @MokenaLotClean @LegionHoops @BullsCentralYT @NBCSBulls @chicagobulls Your expectations for Pat don't seem to be in line with anything he has ever done at any level of basketball in his life.  You might be right, but there's no meaningful reason to think he is going to be a 16/7/5 guy.Chicago Bulls was the like the first NBA club most Nigerians supported. I can remember how people were rushing the Jerseys and face caps back in the days@stephenasmith said @DeMar_DeRozan was a horrible fit for @chicagobulls before the season started. The other night he called him a terrific fit 🤦🏾‍♂️🤣... He then said @NikolaVucevic was the "weak link", and Vuc proceeded to get 18/15/8/3 in a win.

I think the bulls roster when they are healthy again are a finals team.@Bullskickass I watched the @ESPNNBA trade special yesterday. No one mentioned the @chicagobulls once🤬@RickSim03277286 @JuniperScribe @Bulls_Peck @MokenaLotClean @LegionHoops @BullsCentralYT @NBCSBulls @chicagobulls The Bulls choose to not commit to either.  We didn't trade from the now to increase the future, nor did we trade from the future to increase the now (at least at the deadline, we obviously did plenty of that over the last year).@Doug_Thonus @JuniperScribe @Bulls_Peck @MokenaLotClean @LegionHoops @BullsCentralYT @NBCSBulls @chicagobulls I think if the Bulls would trade Pat away then in a couple years they would be looking for a guy like Pat for their team. His main contribution is going to be doing the dirty work, getting buckets when called on, and taking the hybrid wings 1 on 1.@RickSim03277286 @JuniperScribe @Bulls_Peck @MokenaLotClean @LegionHoops @BullsCentralYT @NBCSBulls @chicagobulls Once you accept that whatever you do, you probably won't win, you can choose to increase your odds this year or increase them in the future or play a combination of not committing to either.@TheTyJager Bulls for me cause I got family in Chicago@KingsOfTheW @lborom_ @chicagobulls Knew*🚨New episode alert🚨 Its @ForceStarz SZN so we linked up with our guy from the crib @RealKrisDLofton and spoke about:

He would be the 4th option so his scoring would certainly drop or it would disrupt the chemistry of the team. He would only add an available body to the rotation, which PW will be in a month ish.@Qman312 @lborom_ @chicagobulls Calm down weirdo never new someone can get so pressed over twitter.🙄I have Bulls tickets available for tonight’s game.

That's where we might differ. I'm not sure if I see that … yet. I don't look at him the way I look at Evan Mobley. BTW, I hope you're right.@RickSim03277286 @JuniperScribe @Bulls_Peck @MokenaLotClean @LegionHoops @BullsCentralYT @NBCSBulls @chicagobulls It's certainly valid to say you don't want to go all-in this year and want to keep options for improvement down the line.  Williams is more likely to help you in 2+ years than Grant (likely gone) but also worth noting he doesn't project as a star and won't be a cheap resourceTHEEE Chicago Bulls Play Basketball Today.

Kerr  was used only for threes...that's it!!! Most of his shots were 3s...And Pippen  once  again  was straight  from college and was developed  under the bulls..They didn't  get him as an all star  he became  one.LeBron  only plays  with all stars no developed under him@chicagobulls @SamSmithHoops 👍🏼 How do you argue with a genius? You don’t.I'm glad the @chicagobulls didn't make a move during the trade deadline. We already have a really good team and once we're whole again we'll be back a dangerous tough gritty team. #NBATradeDeadline #BullsNation@jk5987 @chicagobulls @SamSmithHoops Is there a chance they will be bought out? And they came join the bulls?@FaceGod37 @CkingsleyS4 @vegemiterator @ChaddeusY @Chicago_R_Us Read. Always said Bulls second run.@CkingsleyS4 @vegemiterator @FaceGod37 @ChaddeusY @Chicago_R_Us Jordan had the best team ever around him for the Bulls 2nd run.  Pippen (current steals leader), Rodman (current rebounds leader), Kerr (3pts % leader) plus Kukoc (best euro pro player at the time) plus Harper (averaging 20ppg before joining Chicago).

For all you know, they might of played worse. If Giannis isn’t a threat then why did the NBA purposely censor some of his highlights on this West coast trip and basically ignore him?@MokenaLotClean @LegionHoops @BullsCentralYT @Bulls_Peck @NBCSBulls @chicagobulls @Doug_Thonus Grants already saying he wants a lot of money and to be a primary option where ever he goes, bulls would not do either of those, he’s be a 3/4th option and would be lower priority for resigning than Zach. Sounds like a problem just waiting to happen if he was traded here.@chicagobulls_12 @RatiodbyBando @ESPNNBA @KendrickPerkins Giannis is ascending to a new level now that Embiid and Jokic caught up. Took us a while with Brook and our Big 3 not playing together. Remember Giannis put up 44 on AD &amp; Lebron. He threw Lebron back 6 feet on one play.
