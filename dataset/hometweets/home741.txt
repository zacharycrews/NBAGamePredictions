Randle would be an amazing fit on the Warriors. Randle and Mitch for Kuminga and Wiseman, salary filler. I want a deal like that. Randle as the 3rd option there would be amazing.@Kangnem1224 @Muntasirmasud1 @StartMcBride @NBA @SteveNash @StephenCurry30 @warriors @BrooklynNets What 😂 how you supposed to know if someone is having good or bad game 😂 n u just stated stats 🤦🏿‍♂️Tonight’s office. @warriors coverage begins at 4:30 PM on @abc7newsbayarea , tip-off at 5:30 &amp; After The Game follows. #DubNation #NBA75 https://t.co/geHItHUBz8"He's the Spirit of What We Do." | Golden State Warriors on Klay Thompson

Its a good thing he replied back@LakersxWhitesox @NBA @andre @warriors For free@phil_hellmuth @espn @warriors I always forget how tall Phil Hellmuth is, and then he stands next to a pro basketball player and stoops down for the photo. Sheesh.@lmcd01 @NBA @andre @warriors For what@LakersxWhitesox @NBA @andre @warriors I know hahahaha (please give me howard) 😐@hayescarroll_ @warriors You can’t even beat a gleague team mate!! Gtfo@LakersxWhitesox @NBA @andre @warriors That’s what I’m guessing unless Pelinka makes moves like giving warriors Dwight@lmcd01 @NBA @andre @warriors Yeah you’re right, first round exit on the way@LakersxWhitesox @NBA @andre @warriors I know and I hope the lakers don’t but there’s no way a team that has Lebron on it doesn’t at least make play-in@lmcd01 @NBA @andre @warriors We don’t deserve to@LakersxWhitesox @NBA @andre @warriors You can beat every team from blazers downwards plus clippers https://t.co/Tvu7dOIwkgGolden State easily has the best offense in the league. Their constant off-ball movement such as screen setting and cutting, elite perimeter shooting from across the board, and the superstar efforts of Steph Curry make the #Warriors nearly impossible to defend.@warriors How can Devin Booker be behind Klay Thompson in all star voting?when Klay hardly even played games?That's ridiculous!!Klay Thompson With a POSTER SLAM in Golden State Warriors Return | Jan. 9, 2022
