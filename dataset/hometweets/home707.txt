Michael JordanJayson Tatum busted out of a shooting slump by nailing nine three-pointers en route to a season-high 51 points to lead the Boston Celtics to a 116-87 blowout win over the Washington Wizards on Sunday.

Read it here: https://t.co/JAhefKxhgy https://t.co/XNjlX66SsK@epark1016 Lakers lost the game, screw Westbrook's stats.
This is not the Washington Wizards franchise.@OVOLakeShow Sometimes players have to be saved from themselves, Lakers GM should be the voice of reason to tell them NOPE, CAN'T DO IT. That would saved the Lakers a lot of trouble.
Russell Westbrook would still be playing for the Washington Wizards.The Washington Wizards ... call your office!"Don't you know that you are a shooting star?"
