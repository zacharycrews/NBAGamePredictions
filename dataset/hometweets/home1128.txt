#ThunderUp https://t.co/fzsKeYDLua@Matthew17663548 @trailblazers That‚Äôs what it‚Äôs all about!@memgrizz 3 years ago, it wouldn‚Äôt occur to me that these Grizzlies will be the one to shut the championship window for the @warriors, @trailblazers, @Lakers.Tonight I get to shoot a Portland Trail Blazers Game.

Only 3 years ago I was nowhere near working in sports. 

I‚Äôm 36 years old and a single mother to 3 children.

It‚Äôs never too late to work for your dreams.March 28 2018 - @CJMcCollum totaled 42 points on 16-for-25 FG but @trailblazers snapped a 7-game road winning streak w/108-103 loss to @memgrizz.  It was 3rd longest road winning streak in #Blazers history.
