Double Standards smh.@BamBam1A can you get me some tickets to see golden state warriors?@warriors HC Steve Kerr truly ‘gets it.’ When preparing your team early in the season sprinkle in questions to players that allow them to make decisions.

Let's just say the grizz went 10-10 without him. Their record would be 45-31; tied for the 5th seed. The team held their own w/o him so it's not purely ja.

Kudos to the grizzlies team, Need I remind you Ja was balling out, averaging 27 PPG before he got hurt. 

He is the MVP of that team.

So bruh when I say Ja happened

Ja happened for real@KlayForTrey @warriors clearly they dgaf, not worth to argue with I guess, unless they actually win something to show off, maybe.

but if the warriors really give a sh—t, Draymond would have already been furious, so. just let them talk their sh—t.Stephen Curry is an American professional basketball player.

For the warriors, besides Steph shooting threes for fun, the team is still a contender@KlayForTrey @warriors how much playoff success yall had so far?@TrueLakersFan99 @jovanbuha On the offensive side of the ball, hell yes because Luke Walton spent time in the Golden State Warriors Offensive System as interim head coach for that 73-win team. Not as a defensive coordinator.Andre Iguodala spent 8 seasons on the Philadelphia 76ers.

But will be forever remembered as part of the Golden State Warriors. https://t.co/oxQ14o3SyZGsw have a package @warriors https://t.co/IzdSeeInUv@DogSurfRoadshow @memgrizz @warriors Cry me a river!.....sheesh.

Stop it@notbetterthan1 @IamMarvindotcom @DogSurfRoadshow @memgrizz @warriors I'll tell you this I'm not scared of the suns at all.I'm just not.Reason is like u said fouls don't get called and Dillon Brooks gone be real physical Devin Booker. And everybody think Mikal Bridges gone stop Ja last time we played them Ja cooked him cuz he pick n roll not iso.@ButtCrackSports @KlayForTrey @warriors made the wcf and had two allstars but ok@KlayForTrey @warriors @StephenCurry30 @KlayThompson @Money23Green @andre. Determined to win
Since 2019 @warriors back in playoffs.if y’all can’t beat this team in a series then you’re sorrier than I thought @warriors@warriors y’all can fall to the 4th tbh@notbetterthan1 @IamMarvindotcom @DogSurfRoadshow @memgrizz @warriors Only thing I don't like about them is Pat Bev he try to undercut Ja he the reason why Ja hurt nowIf Golden State was to drop to 4 and Utah stayed at 5 (I doubt it) I would pick Golden State to win that series despite the struggles the Warriors been having. I can not take Utah serious at all.@MacAction30 @IamMarvindotcom @DogSurfRoadshow @memgrizz @warriors T wolves be lucky to win a single playoff game.   Zero D won’t fly.April 7th: @sixers v @Raptors and @memgrizz v @nuggets 
Neither one is on National TV…. Instead, @NBAonTNT is airing @lakers v @warriors@notbetterthan1 @IamMarvindotcom @DogSurfRoadshow @memgrizz @warriors I think the T wolves, and Jazz just because they shoot a ton of threes and they put em up contested and reckless and they can get hot but never played them with Dillon Brooks either but definitely those two.Suns vs. Warriors Odds, Preview, Prediction: How To Fade Golden State Without Stephen Curry (March 30) https://t.co/QS8F0By6CeWe're coming for that #3 seed you better be ready @warriors@ThadCapper @warriors Even Kanter coulda helped…@MacAction30 @IamMarvindotcom @DogSurfRoadshow @memgrizz @warriors Ok which team is the toughest matchup in the west for the grizzlies?@notbetterthan1 @IamMarvindotcom @DogSurfRoadshow @memgrizz @warriors Lol calls he don't get calls he only avg 7 free throw att a game..

Got it.@IamMarvindotcom @notbetterthan1 @DogSurfRoadshow @memgrizz @warriors And I think your overvaluing playoff experience, y'all forget the the 8th seed Grizzlies beat the Champion pedigree #1 seed Spurs and that was the Grizzlies first playoff berth since trading Pau Gasol. Playoffs is about matchups that other stuff is media dressing just sounds good@lijah2cold4U @DRR124kta @aspecgod @warriors He would start over Wiggins@Trell707 @DRR124kta @aspecgod @warriors Halliburton is on a mediocre kings team don’t get me wrong Halliburton is really good but he got way more playing time his first 2 years.@markhaynesnba 
@warriors,@SteveKerr,
If a team has talented players who can play 8- 9 deep (like GSW), the absence of 1 star (Steph) SHOULD NOT be reason for losing so many games. Look at Phoenix, Memphis, they still win despite injuries. So WHAT IS BUGGING GSW? @esfajardo2003@IamMarvindotcom @MacAction30 @DogSurfRoadshow @memgrizz @warriors Playoffs are a different beast.  It’s basically a different game.  Wait till they don’t give Ja a few calls.Holla, if you’re looking for @warriors playoff tickets. Selling one game, 1st or 2nd home game. $800 for 2 tickets in section 123 row 21, seats 8 &amp; 9. #dubnation #2022NBAPlayoffs https://t.co/TOwLtAM0Bm@notbetterthan1 @IamMarvindotcom @DogSurfRoadshow @memgrizz @warriors Naw we done swept that series even when PG played they can't stop Jaren Jackson Jr he play like Kevin Garnett against them.@MacAction30 @IamMarvindotcom @DogSurfRoadshow @memgrizz @warriors Warriors got dethroned in 2019, this is more of a late hurrah. Focusing on them is silly and yet revealing.@MacAction30 @IamMarvindotcom @DogSurfRoadshow @memgrizz @warriors I would guess a clippers team with PG back now isn’t the best matchup for neither Memphis nor Phoenix.

@BamBam1A https://t.co/dmvWm4EvuU@notbetterthan1 @IamMarvindotcom @DogSurfRoadshow @memgrizz @warriors and we had slow footed Jonas Valencuinas in pick and roll coverage plus they've been playing high level basketball since Ja rookie year when rebuilding teams usually tank for lottery picks, naw this team different 2nd best record in the NBA proves that.@MacAction30 @IamMarvindotcom @DogSurfRoadshow @memgrizz @warriors Jazz may have been rated top 3 on D but nobody took them seriously as a contender, and were not scared of their D.    Don’t overrate that.  Warriors lost in playoffs to Spurs (lost in finals to heat) and clippers (lob city peak)So we got GSW vs UTA on April 2 and GSW vs LAL on April 7!!!!!!
So maybe Bambam will show up at these games of @warriors?!!!  WAAAAHHHHH!!!!

I know Phoenix can, Milwaukee, etc.   playoffs are different.@kiGZterSHMK @DogSurfRoadshow @memgrizz @warriors Casually ignoring that the Grizzlies were missing their 2 best players + 3-1 this year + knockout last year.@DogSurfRoadshow @LockedOnDubs @warriors Is he the Kerr Stan?🤣 if he is haha like who else’s fault is us making few if any defensive or offensive adjustments? We lose so many winnable games. We underperform all the time. No TOs? Bad challenges. He protects loon over Steph on bad calls. I want u to really destroy him 🤣@Portantino @Ahsha_Safai @DDCalifornia @Garydwayne @warriors @CaliforniaPTA @MeganPotente @GavinNewsom Thank you for not giving up on SB237!@notbetterthan1 @IamMarvindotcom @DogSurfRoadshow @memgrizz @warriors Y'all didn't win it yet and nobody ain't pick y'all yet either they said the same thing about y'all that they said bout us. Plus I have been watching the NBA for 27 years, I've never seen a young team like the Grizzlies this is year 3 of a rebuild they don't play young at all.What did I say?? Ain't shit without curry #DubNation #goldenstatewarriors https://t.co/C7zGmptjML@notbetterthan1 @IamMarvindotcom @DogSurfRoadshow @memgrizz @warriors I know that.. Im not talking about to those years, I'm talking about Steve Kerr's first year team, Draymond Green taking David Lee starting spot team, Draymond was talking mad shit  and being brash sticking his tongue out at Blake Griffin which I enjoyed by the way,Billie is up next! @ Chase Center - Home of the Golden State Warriors https://t.co/MtQZH3PpKMWow @JHarden13 that is amazing. I have always liked the @warriors  but I am a @sixers fan now too! https://t.co/GmrXnmqDQJ@warriors if they don't win it this year, next year boutta be scary af. we got healthy klay, healthy steph, no wiggs and a better Jordan Poole.@MacAction30 @IamMarvindotcom @DogSurfRoadshow @memgrizz @warriors You’re wrong about this.  The warriors were bad for stephs first few years, then took their playoff lumps after that, THEN won a title.  You should take heed of that timeline. Its the same for EVERY young team that grows into a champ. Y’all have a step or two to go.BIG GAME DAY TOMORROW.

Tomorrow's game will be the determining factor. Are we who we say we are? Or are the Golden State Warriors a mere shell of their old selves?@Dru415 @DogSurfRoadshow @memgrizz @warriors Like I said before I got the years mixed up I meant their first 🏆 run, they were talking shit before they won esp Draymond he was the ultimate hate em if he against your team love him if he on your team guy. Thats the year he was sticking his tongue out at Blake Griffin.@KlayForTrey @warriors Will they make it to the conference finals? 
Or just be another "utah jazz" in regular season?@LatrellSpacwell @warriors @nyknicks @Timberwolves @AbelAvellan Former and current nobody - MC Escher is also all-in on the $ASTS and actively begging his wife for permission to deposit more account funds.@KlayForTrey @warriors Lot of shit talk for a team that hasn’t proved anything yet.
