Following Jalen Brunson's huge 40 point performance, we can expect the Jazz to make some changes in Game 3...without understanding where the core of the Utah Jazz brand, it can be difficult to understand that they are working with @nba_paint to help show off THEIR brand. 

Again - my bad. No offense intended. Jazz in 6. 

the crusty old gatekeeper.But the scattered visual approach and attempt to move away from the core visuals of the NBA have been confusing for some @utahjazz fans, and...However, for those of you who are not @utahjazz fans, and who only come from the @nba_paint side, things have...how can I say this? Not been great when it comes to the overall visual approach over the last year or two.There are too many gatekeepers out there already, and yeah, most of them are crusty and old.

Weird vibe with that team. Low spirit, like they're just co-workers.  See if it changes now that the series is in SLC. That building gets loud.

It was bad yes, but the offense was worse! It's an unpopular take, but I say press and RUN on offense and win the game!

BTW, trading Gobert and a pick for Wiggins is a great way to improve your perimeter defense @utahjazz 👀@wojespn Either way the Mavs gonna win this.

If you haven't listened to the latest episode of #RoundballRoundup, you're missing out 👀@Void_Existence_ @utahjazz Yeah man, but Shaq had some post moves and had a good post shot as he backed down defenders. Gobert has nothing close to that he just dunks off lobs or occasionally gets put backs no post game at all@RomRB5 @utahjazz He has no post game literally only catches lobs or gets put back dunks that's it. He has no post gameBoth the players the Utah Jazz got for Dominique Wilkins-John Drew &amp; Freeman Williams-a few decades ago just died within 10 days of each other.@doommetalface @bwalters_04 @utahjazz Luka dropped 40 multiple nights on KAWHI and PG💀 dude you don’t watch and it shows@utahjazz What about getting worse each game like they usually do?@colby_colonel @utahjazz If anyone is selling one ticket let me knowWill Mavericks superstar Luka Doncic play against the Utah Jazz in Game 3 Thursday?
