On occasion, George Gervin, James Silas, and Willie Wise even made runs at being my favorite.

There was a basketball player from North Carolina, Alex English, who played for the Denver Nuggets in the 1980's who was the most graceful and elegant basketball player I've ever seen.  Roger is like that in tennis.  It is a major compliment.
