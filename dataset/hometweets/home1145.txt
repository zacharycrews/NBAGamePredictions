🫠The Detroit Pistons have recalled Luka Garza from the Motor City Cruise.@detroit_wyso @chimeziegoated @kings_muse Yeah but he makes more sense in the Pistons’ system than Lyles did, to be fair. Both players are a better fit for their new teams, so even though their counting stats aren’t very different, they’re both being utilized more effectively. It was a win-win trade.@AussieGeckotv @Pistons_PR @DetroitPistons @bball_ref They need to tank. Get that next player.Today's NBA Consensus (So Far):

This one comes in the 76ers v Pistons matchup. If Embiid doesn’t dominate this Detroit front line I’ll be very surprised. Let’s see if I can get on the right side of Harden’s points today. Cade’s on a tear.🤘 https://t.co/Sj9PN3g01pThe Detroit Pistons have recalled Saben Lee from the Motor City Cruise.@AKB_1534 @DetroitPistons you support racist cops and the russian military, my opinion is way more valid than yoursKickin' it at @LCArena_Detroit tonight 🙌

#Pistons | #NBA | @AndrewKulha  https://t.co/B7S39Eun9ZSixers take on the #Pistons tonight in Detroit…

- Seems like a trap game for Philly after two losses

- Detroit hasn’t lost a game by more 7 PTs since March 11th vs the Celtics

- Rookie, Cade Cunningham is averaging 22.5 PPG, 7.1 APG, and 6.2 RPG in March

If someone played nude I hope they would be arrested immediately for public indecency and thrown in jail for at least 10+ years. My youngest son Randy Jr was flashed by a nude golfer and became a Detroit Pistons fan. Terrifying.@KDTrey5 You know what’s embarrassing Kevin? The lack of effort towards our educational system in 2022. My son (lifelong Detroit Pistons fan) came home and told me about Congress. We should be spending our money on something more important like lowering the price of PBR @JoeBiden#NBA 🏀01/04/2022 schedule,

📱https://t.co/ZsXWn9m5a5 https://t.co/pBmN24ia4j@jackwilly83 Funny story: I'm an avid, hardcare Detroit sports fan who lived in Seattle for 35 years. Saw the Tigers, Lions, and various Michigan college teams visit over the years. Also saw the Pistons play the Sonics. Then they stole the Sonics, with the Pistons' blessing. Bye bye Pistons.@DetroitPistons Rookie. Of. The. Year.@iammarkmonroe @enycest2003 One key element I would like to address. During Mj reign the competition on the court was very physical. Look at some old clippings when Chicago played Detroit Pistons. That type of physical game doesn’t exist anymore.@lamarfromafar savior of the detroit pistons!Detroit Sports have had a big few days, I’m so excited for the future of the Tigers, Lions, Wings and Pistons #theD https://t.co/SMyQXZ5bzu@StephanieWitko1 @DetroitPistons @woodwardsports Prayers@atlhawkstime11 It was shit all right, OKC started guys who don’t belong in the NBA. All of their regular starters were out. That was basically a YMCA team out there. Trae has lost to the Detroit Pistons three times this year.  Start playing some defense and quit playing hero ball.#say_hey @hashimclowney @_DetroitPistons Pursue @JordanPooleWrld  he’s a baddd manDetroit Pistons will be a 7th seed or better next season too, let’s just also put that out there lol@BSMotorCity Outstanding episode by @Castellani2014 talking @NCAA Tourney, @AkilBaddoo, and @DetroitPistons -- great takes as usual. We definitely need to get into the season a bit, but that @tigers excitement is warranted. Baddoo is a big part of it.@based_shesty Between the Red Wings and Pistons, Detroit still don't have enough wins to get a playoff birthIn Game 75 of the 2021-2022 #NewYork #Knicks #NationalBasketballAssociation Season, played on #March 27, 2022, The New York Knicks defeated The #Detroit #Pistons; The New York Knicks record is now: 33-42 https://t.co/3QUzBXmAfF@HammerFox2 With what the owners care about is dollars and we keep spending and spending it is a shame for such a great sports city! The whole squad needs new ownership @tigers @DetroitRedWings @DetroitPistons and lions it's horrible how we are treated@StephanieWitko1 @woodwardsports Please give Oliver a hug for us and tell him he’s a good boy. 🐶 💙Anyone on the 90s Detroit Pistons team https://t.co/L8AwYZp3GN@Joredyne As long as it’s not our arch nemesis The Detroit Pistons'Representation matters': Pistons' female executives pave way for change #Detroit #Pistons #NBA https://t.co/J7hbHlFZTR@jackwilly83 The Pistons fan base is so small that outside of Metro Detroit, the Green Bay Packers fan base is bigger than the Pistons fan baseIf the Toronto Raptors had held down the fort against the Detroit Pistons and Dwane Casey, they'd be one game out of first place in the East right now.Considering the Thunder came back against the Blazers last game, this seriously means nothing:

The Detroit Pistons defeated the Atlanta Hawks by 21 points last week.

Oklahoma City is on track to lose by 20+ points tonight against Atlanta.

Up next for the Thunder, the Pistons.Saddiq Bey is really gonna be in the top 10 of 3 pointers made by a Detroit Piston in his 3rd year.

Detroit Pistons, Lions and Tigers lifer fan too. Live in Utah now 👍Which one of these young stars ⭐️ will have a better career Cade or Melo? #CadeCunningham #Lamelo #Pistons #Hornets #Detroit #Charlotte #NBA #ROTY https://t.co/nfOwOH7qlqHow Detroit Pistons' Cade Cunningham showed 'it' factor vs. Nets, Kevin Durant https://t.co/Pu10lvz3vd@celtics really be playing that 04 Detroit Pistons defence ⛓Lebron did not have to play against the hack fest that was the bad boys - Detroit pistons.  All he does is whine now. Can you imagine back then. 😱🤣🤣🤣 https://t.co/PddatWQ1UaOh great, there are two more @Lakers games on National TV and NBATV this week. I get they have LeBron, but he's hurt, and they're garbage. I'd rather watch the @DetroitPistons or @SacramentoKings right now. They are more entertaining.Random bold prediction for all my Detroit sports homies here — I think the Tigers make the playoffs this year, and that them and the Pistons will both be the breakout teams in their respective sports in 2023. It’s warming up in the D.@DetroitPistons @HenryFordHealth @Cory_Joe @drcoreyyeager @mrdavidmccullar I’m trying to see how many MLB and NBA teams will follow me for my birthday. What up doe Detroit? One final attempt@DetroitPistons PUSH THAT AGENDA@MenaTrey @DetroitPistons This guys got talent@merryweatherbo1 @DetroitPistons Let's see here ! And there is alot more https://t.co/O9xuLkRpqd@NewsSportsINC @ATrainOnUrMom @DetroitPistons It wouldn't help the pistons future. Good teams draft superstars not trade or sign them
The Brooklyn Nets just proved me wrong@RossBenjamin1 @Bucks @BrooklynNets @LAClippers @chicagobulls @sixers @DetroitPistons @OffShoreGaming @sportsmemo @SM_Free_Plays @YouTube Is it true honor to join my dear friend Ross Benjamin today thank you for having us buddySomeone please tell me why @NBA2K makes all career players go to the @DetroitPistons?  1. Force a trade. 2. Play year out them leave. 3. Give up an play park I guess… then force a trade. You all wrong for this draft setupA week from tonight, my wife and I will visit Little Ceasars Arena for the first time to see the @DetroitPistons host the @dallasmavs. Can't wait to see Detroit Basketball in action! Hopefully Luka Doncic too.@NBA Cade Cunningham for Rookie of the Year @DetroitPistons@PeteyHarrison @MCannon313 @WorldofIsaac @wojespn Petey is spitting facts, but let Detroit fans have their tiny victories. They don't get many of them and the Pistons are a horrendous team as is. 

Cade winning that award would be the best thing to happen to that city since the wings last title.
