How incredibly professional. 🙄@Lawzzie_ He’s also on the Sacramento Kings now to make matters worse.@arxanii @ATLHawks @celtics @hornets @chicagobulls @dallasmavs @nuggets @warriors @LAClippers @Lakers @memgrizz @MiamiHEAT @Bucks @PelicansNBA @nyknicks @OrlandoMagic @sixers @Suns @SacramentoKings @Raptors PSA I’ve heard THJ might be down a while Mavs you can jump in the sweepstakes.

Don’t think about it I promise you’ll make the playoffs 😂It’s impressive/amazing that the @SacramentoKings #courtsidepuker was never identified. #orIamjustlazyandwantsomeonetocorrectmeEric Gordon had 24 points on 71% shooting and hit the game winner tonight

@ATLHawks @celtics @hornets @chicagobulls @dallasmavs @nuggets @warriors @LAClippers @Lakers @memgrizz @MiamiHEAT @Bucks @PelicansNBA @nyknicks @OrlandoMagic @sixers @Suns @SacramentoKings @RaptorsMinnesota and Sacramento have 1 winning season since 2007. Combined. One. 

The Thunder have as many playoff appearances since 07 as the Kings have in Sacramento.

The Sixers won 19% of their games from 2013-16. The Thunder, since deciding to tank, have won 30% of their games.@LndsPatterson Bring back the Kings. It's not like they've done anything in Sacramento
