They just hate how he ended his time in Houston. There’s a difference.The Houston Rockets have been eliminated from playoff contention.@coolninja831 @gokurose2121 @notjmorant @GrizzliesPR @memgrizz @HoustonRockets We’re only a half game ahead of golden state and the schedule with the last 10 games isn’t all that easy. They’re just gonna see “knee soreness” so they don’t get fined. Gotta save Ja for the stretch run.@johntollll @zensharky @hamedjan24 @GrizzliesPR @memgrizz @HoustonRockets Tends to happen early on with the superstars, I think that was an issue with KAT up in Minnesota until this season.

The reason they carried on shooting them was that nothing was being called at the rim.@CalderonFan4Lyf @neilbelieves @basketballreelz @NBAHistory @chicagobulls It took the Rockets 7 games to beat the Knicks.
Same Knicks team that needed 7 games to beat the Bulls without MJ.

Bulls would have beaten both teams in 5-6 games.

With his ability to shoot from the outside and he also has a potential to be a great defender in the NBA, with Jalen Green and KPJ handling the ball, Houston needs to surround them with great shooting.@WoodToChina @5ft10reboundgod @JalenRockets smile if youre a houston rocket https://t.co/hsCc1HAU9Awhen ja morant posterizes chet hologren as a houston rocket will be a banner day@Htown_fyre @RooshWilliams @RashadTho Moses went to a finals and won two MVPs with us so it feels like it has to be him. In a story that is pretty familiar to Houston sports fans.

Taylor does know that 5 doesn't foul him out....right??@iyokil24 @HoustonRockets I know I watched that, I like him lol but they got worked by bookOne potential benefit of Houston’s shocking late collapse versus Indiana is 2022 NBA draft positioning, with the Rockets taking back firm control of the No. 1 slot.  https://t.co/4hy1zpB2EzThe Houston Rockets Gerald Green had a falling out with his uncle billy.@RooshWilliams backbone of this team is and always will be @JoseAltuve27 our franchise player &amp; for sure wants to remain in the team until he retires.
