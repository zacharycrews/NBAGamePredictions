👉 https://t.co/UfJNmG3ta4 https://t.co/gIjPwdEUwE@OrlandoMagic Is Gary not playing tonight?Haha I’m so ignorant about basketball (even though I really enjoy highlight videos) that I just learned TODAY that Shaq played for more than one team.

I just remember him in Taco Bell ads or whatever in the early ‘90s w/ Orlando Magic gear and did no further research.@BenStinar Of course there’s no pressure to win in Orlando no one would care if the Magic lose either. Russell gets paid $44 million dollars a year and can’t make layups and his bank shots look like he’s shooting bricks damn maybe he’s just trying to hard. 🤷🏻‍♂️@Daniel_Pogue73 @StelliniTweets We are going to T Wolves at Orlando Magic on Friday.

Won’t be 100% secondly it’s too late in the season to be trying. You can’t really be this stupid🚨INJURY UPDATE:
@OrlandoMagic guard Jalen Suggs will not play tonight vs Phoenix due to a sprained right ankle.

#MagicTogetherJalen Suggs (right ankle sprain) will not play in the @OrlandoMagic’s home game against the @Suns tonight. https://t.co/yWhtQ0ErR1@ninawestbrook I saw your comments on new article about Orlando Magic and Russ. I have to agree as a Lakers fan since 87 and I can say this isn't Russ fault. This all LeBron! AD is always injured and Carmelo is a wasted bench slot.The Suns opened -7.5 in Orlando tonight against the Magic. Looked low. Now it’s down to -6. I certainly was ready to follow the movement, but after further review, it’s based off injury news.

The Magic have a glut of young guards, but can’t let a guy with a number-one ceiling fall any further. They have looked for a primary option for a decade, and think Cole Anthony might be better suited as a super-6th man. https://t.co/9OOiSD1CEFI lived in Orlando for most of my 20s &amp; early 30s.

https://t.co/5yavFxaHJPOrlando Magic learning to play at Markelle Fultz's speed – NBA News https://t.co/o0gdwdQ6eXSteve, magic isn't real. If it is real then the Orlando Magic would've win a championship by now.@SFsGOAT @heatfan26768645 Point is kinda moot considering his best series by far was against the #1 defense 59 win Orlando Magic. You could argue he went easy on the Pistons and Hawks.@thewiserwon @ninawestbrook @BenStinar The Orlando Magic are a liability as a wholeThe Jokic Effect:

AG as a member of the Orlando Magic: 53.1 TS% and 68% inside 3ft

AG as a Nugget: 58.9 TS% and 79.4% inside 3 ft.@DalanoDimes @LaVinesBurner Orlando Magic Win %: 46.8%
Miami Marlins Win%: 46.1%

I fear they don’t@MattUtterback23 @TREZBROWN1 @BleacherReport @S_Universal Even if it was prestigious you cannot defend the man this season. He could happily be in the Orlando Magic not caring bout no god damn expectations making his contribution of the night scoring a bit making some assists and losing like always but decided better to ruin The LakersRuss can save his crocodile tears for when we send him to Orlando magic@lilPenny_Burner @OrlandoMagic Lol I guess@OTOWN4LIFE1 @OrlandoMagic Cause the real ones knowMarch 7, 2010: During an iconic inbounds pass, Los Angeles #Lakers SG Kobe Bryant didn't flinch at all after Orlando Magic F Matt Barnes pump-faked the ball right in his face, epitomizing his mamba mentality

#GamblingTwitter #Sportsbetting@Suns vs @OrlandoMagic game boutta be active tomorrow🔥@BenStinar Lol I see your point, but is that whata team like Orlando Magic would want tho? Hurting lottery chances, no?@VNavarro12345 @LakersNation Not attacking WB personally. I hoped he would prove people wrong because his success would translate to team success...he has been far worse than I would ever have imagined and I hope he averages a triple double for the Orlando Magic next year.@rolopez42 @nba_paint @OrlandoMagic @br_orlandomagic Never say never. I can for sure a robin down the lineI'm #tradingTheKing A.D. &amp; @russwest44 re-build with @ChetHolmgren I guarantee next #MarchMadness this @Lakers squad has as good or a better record than with @KingJames 28-35 #HoustonRockets #DetroitPistons #OrlandoMagic he's available for trade https://t.co/DZ5gA6qJ0lIt wasn't the Orlando Magic? https://t.co/fcBtxS4WEXI agree make the trade @OrlandoMagic https://t.co/9aHpDRdA3V@RefAubrey Must be traffic congestion from where @OrlandoMagic is sucking at home and everyone is leaving at the same time.@LakeShowYo @Lakers Westbrook is gonna carry the Orlando Magic to the playoffs next season according to his wife...from what I hear from twitter.Get this guy on the Orlando magic. https://t.co/6WNpZvE96D@OrlandoMagic @MarkelleF markelle fultz@susan1234456789 You can keep trolling but Harden is miles better than Westbrook, I've never seen a superstar miss this many layups in my life, he should go to a team like Orlando Magic next year@rolopez42 @OrlandoMagic @TerrenceRoss @br_orlandomagic Fixed it. https://t.co/52LI7gKhTC@nba_paint @OrlandoMagic @TerrenceRoss @br_orlandomagic Robin never gets to be in theatrical Batman flicks. But hey, they nailed the casting for the lead.@Larrybitme772 @YaHateTwoSeeIt Youll never win a title without Dwade.  Sure you’ll make a finals or two, but thats about it, no different from the Orlando Magic’s history.  CopeThe Most Magical Place On Earth 💫 🏰

WE💥G O T💥ALOT💥P O P P I N GI wanna watch the heat vs Orlando magic next month 🤔Future Orlando Magic/Houston Rockets Chet Holmgreen playing@YesItsJustRick You're an Orlando magic fanMake that 3 teams.... Orlando Magic too@shendy456 @OMasood8842 U keep saying run it back as if the Magic wasn’t the superior team. Shaq is the most modern say  dominant big man ever in his prime. Prime penny, prime Horace grant who was paid franchise money in Orlando. Prime denis Scott. Pippen was the only allstar Jordan had with no big manYou hear that @OrlandoMagic time to trade for him https://t.co/urQLPg6Pmm@hiItsAlyyy I've been talking for a few years of moving to Orlando for retirement. But I wonder how big a part of the magic for me is how rarely I actually get into the Mouse House.It has taken Markelle Fultz 1,122 days with the @OrlandoMagic organisation to suit up for 83 games.

If you think it has been agonizing to wait for @MarkelleF, spare a thought for the early 2000s Magic fans, who waited 1,629 days for @realgranthill33 to hit the same mark. https://t.co/mmkHG12guEObligatory posting of @OrlandoMagic @MichelobULTRA can, found at 7-11 on OBT by the 417 in South Orlando https://t.co/x19U31CN3k@JonnyHeller The Orlando Magic scare more more than the Bulls@OrlandoMagic he’s ready to go https://t.co/4a3ZlXPqxp@SLAMonline @MiamiHEAT Former and future member of the Orlando Magic.@nba_paint @TerrenceRoss @OrlandoMagic CJ McGollum?

Advocating for him to carry the Orlando Magic as he flops under Laker expectations is an insane lack of self awareness.@BenStinar @OrlandoMagic make it happen🎵We are the people we've been waiting for.
