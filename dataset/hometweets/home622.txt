#MagicTogether #AllFLy #NBA75 https://t.co/v9nSnsUaDK@KyleBaileyClub @hornets I don‚Äôt want Anthony Davis. So no.@KyleBaileyClub @hornets You may get a seasons worth of games out of AD over 4 years‚Ä¶.@KyleBaileyClub @hornets Pass@KyleBaileyClub @hornets I couldn't do it. If it was the AD coming from the Pelicans probably, but not now. Very inconsistent, injury prone, huge salary. I like the development of this young team and how Mitch has drafted. We would be a beast of a team when healthy.@KyleBaileyClub @hornets Legally you aren‚Äôt allowed to have Christian McCaffery and Ant Davis in the same city@KyleBaileyClub @hornets No thanks.@KyleBaileyClub @hornets Big nope@jni123 @KyleBaileyClub @hornets Davis can‚Äôt stay on the floorMore sport stuff, a memory of my brief spell living in Charlotte North Carolina (I have a massive padded Charlotte Hornets started jacket somewhere, it‚Äôs like a duvet with arms)

An Aussie Rugby shirt from my time in Adelaide ‚Ä¶. Though I‚Äôve never live in Wigan! https://t.co/tQhvebIQWc@KyleBaileyClub @hornets Yes. No question. The goal is to win a title. The team is really fun. It‚Äôs not a title contender. Davis raises the ceiling substantially.@KyleBaileyClub @hornets HELL NO@KyleBaileyClub @hornets Why would we trade all those guys who have been balling to get a guy who can't stay healthy his entire career? No thanks.@KyleBaileyClub @hornets Not NO but Hell No!@KyleBaileyClub @hornets Hell no@KyleBaileyClub @hornets They wouldn‚Äôt do it but I would package this deal to Minnesota for KAT.

AD is broken@KyleBaileyClub @hornets Not as horrible as some of the 3 for one trades for Turner‚Ä¶..would have to be contingent on AD agreeing to play center, which probably wouldn‚Äôt happen. Not possible though as Charlotte can‚Äôt trade 2023 pick.@KyleBaileyClub @hornets No AD is never healthy@KyleBaileyClub @hornets Heck no.  He is damaged goods!@KyleBaileyClub @hornets It‚Äôs a big fat NO from me!@KyleBaileyClub @hornets If you'd like to get older, not be as good and have a 'superstar' who's injured 30 games a year, sure.@KyleBaileyClub @hornets Nah, AD is injured way too often to give up those picks@ckh_gallus @hornets LOL same.@KyleBaileyClub @hornets No...we are a solid team now who is only getting stronger!@KyleBaileyClub @hornets It's so much a yes, there is no way Lakers would even entertain that deal.@KyleBaileyClub @hornets AD is a walking injury report.

Don‚Äôt really care tbh just get his ass out hereüòÇ@MeIoWRLD @hornets @MELOD1P they don‚Äôt view him as a franchise player which is funny lol@WillKunkelFOX @hornets Then stop sucking as a coach!This is now a Charlotte Hornets fan account btw@CallyBistro @hornets @gordonhayward @MilesBridges @MELOD1P @T_Rozzay3 Melo love da kidsThe Charlotte Hornets: https://t.co/ykSWMZw4aP https://t.co/bDHpnl3YfV@wojespn @hornets get him pleaseCan we get some perspective from some @hornets fans on this one? How close or far away are we on this‚Ä¶ @sponhourm @Hershayy_  ‚ù§Ô∏è@Nikki704 @hornets See ya there! #AllFly@Carlosmeraz__ @WashedJaden @buzz_szn @hornets I like that trade. Plumlee would be useless to us after trade, Kai doesn't play plus we got a young Richards/Thor/Carey already, and Martin is really just a hustle guy who we can replace.David Tepper has built the worst Panthers team with a bad HC Matt Rhule why MJ has built a red hot Charlotte Hornets #KeepPounding #Hornets #tepper #NFL@CrownClubCLT Yall helped invent the narrative glorifying every time fans boo or chant about firing rhule. And youre a hornets/charlotte fan group. The way yall act it wouldnt shock me at all if rhules family got harassed and screamed at during hornets games. Esp from drunk fans@Dan_Savage @jalensuggs @OrlandoMagic @hornets @BallySportsFL Tell Mose if he doesn‚Äôt start him I‚Äôll tweet mean stuff!@WillKunkelFOX @hornets Feel like he‚Äôs good at PR and building sympathy.  If the chants are the reason they can‚Äôt go, they‚Äôll get used to that as a coaches kid. 

But I doubt anyone would be directly mean to the kids.@wojespn @nuggets SHOULD TRADE BOL BOL TO THE CHARLOTTE HORNETS so he can play with @MELOD1P #greatadditionFree him @hornets https://t.co/XIQtr7AQLL@hornets gon head and find a way to get Ben Simmons. Package Gordon Hayward w sum and get right@JTerry_ Lol relax,,, I love the Hornets and Panthers but we are not seeing a championship any time soon in Charlotte unfortunately. Cam Newton is the only MVP caliber player we have ever had and look at how he was treated.@Nikki704 @hornets Ditto! First game since the 90s!So pumped to go to the @hornets game tomorrow! https://t.co/wv8qfM79hsThe Charlotte Hornets beat this Bucks team. 

Twice.

In 3 days.@buzz_szn @hornets @gordonhayward @MilesBridges @MELOD1P @T_Rozzay3 Nah they good just wait for opportunitiesgot some anger about those back to back @hornets losses to work out apparently https://t.co/O5q27ZOSS8#Bucks spanking #Warriors but my @hornets just beat the Bucks in back to back games???? Hmmmm 

#BuzzCity #AllFly #NBA https://t.co/ZvaiUfQ3ue@HornetsPR @hornets Y‚Äôall gotta start selling merch for thisPeople forget that Nick Friedman and the Charlotte Hornets have the league‚Äôs 2nd best offenseNo surprise there. The ironic part about this though is when @hornets  make the playoffs, that first round pick will essentially be those two second round picks. Guess 'First Round' just sounds nice. #Knicks #FLEECED https://t.co/60aEkRObEL@WillKunkelFOX @hornets How does the saying go.... made your bed, lay in it@WillKunkelFOX @hornets This kind of venom is just wrong@Jimjone88396869 @overtime @MELOD1P @hornets Omg I can‚Äôt waitüî•üî• https://t.co/lQDFeblLf7A1 move.
