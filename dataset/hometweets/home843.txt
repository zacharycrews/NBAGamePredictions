Also, I only recently learnt that it was part of South America, growing up it was often lumped with Caribbean countries, so I thought it was just one or the other. Sorry about that.@alliyahakhan @justdsm @al33t1 @spicyphimself @Raptors The CARICOM HQ is in Georgetown, if we weren't a Caribbean nation, it wouldn't be there. Not to mention a shared colonial past, a direct cultural connection to nations like Jamaica, T&amp;T, etc.@justdsm @al33t1 @zayn_aziz @spicyphimself @Raptors Guyana is one of those countries that kinda has a cool geographic thing going on where it fits into lots of different boxes -
South American + Caribbean + West Indies@justdsm @al33t1 @zayn_aziz @spicyphimself @Raptors It’s a part of “Caricom” which technically makes it a part of the Caribbean :) 
We share the same culture as most Caribbean people
The cricket team for the West Indies consists of Guyanese people as well, so I mean we lots of ties to the Caribbean community@Raptors @pskills43  @kawhileonard 

I would not trade Pascal for Kawhi right now 1-1, I would ask for 2 1st at the min and he takes a paycut.  That is how good Mr. Siakam is playing@KateBDoll @Raptors @yungwonk @Bucks @sergeibaka But why no big moves at the trade deadline 🤷‍♂️@Raptors https://t.co/jSyJExM3Rv

Most books have -3.5, so take advantage of the better line. The Nuggets lost vs. Boston “last night” in  a tight game, and they have to travel to Toronto overnight.

Raptors have won 8 straight, and -3 is a soft line (I like it even if FVV is out)I’m so sick and tired of hearing this garbage ass excuse as to why a POC can’t be Prime Minister of Canada. 

And the fact that this kind of comment gets upvoted too. Credit to JTM647 for pushing back on it

But I really hope he knows he can’t take it off though 😳😳😳@JJLahey @joearrigofsm Not even joking. Like Demar DeRozan should get a ring for Raptors to get Kawhi.

You’re outta range. 14-15 lebron was in Cleveland. Parades were had. Lebrons homecoming speech was bigger than the park. Pipe down🤫@thejrod_87 You ain't wrong on Twitter.

I think he could help out the team a lot now that all they need is a catch and shoot player and he wouldn’t have to do too much! Early in the season he was shooting 50-40-80 before injuries and covid effected the team so much! But again agree to disagree@jasbloom1998 @Papibob2 @Raptors @wacchi1013 He is underwhelming as a shooter and in all-around aspects tbh I'm glad we benched him. matt thomas was also just a shooter that was working in catch and shoot situations.
