Jonathan Isaac is at 526 days, hasn’t played since Aug. 2, 2020. 

Markelle Fultz is at 368 days, hasn’t played since Jan 6, 2021.

It’s a shame what injuries has done to their careers.@bandito_1914 @OrlandoMagic He’s listed as out for today.. the next 3 games are away games.. so the most realistic date we’re looking at is January 17th MLK day against the Trail Blazers.... fingers crossed man.

#bettingtips #bettingtwitter https://t.co/RA9L2tQlrCMaybe not the best but I was a huge fan of that Orlando Magic team that went and lost to kobe https://t.co/Vd5HSaCoATHamidou Diallo *17-6-0* and the Detroit Pistons beat Gary Harris *28-6-2* and the Orlando Magic 97-92 (2022-01-08)Final: Magic 92-97 Pistons

For the second time this season, the Magic lose in Detroit after a hard fought effort on the road. Orlando took a brief lead but the Pistons led the way for the most part and held on to knock off the Magic.

To continue to have a 3 point shot first with bad shooters is stupid. Too many times he comes up and there are no passes, just shoots a long shot.

https://t.co/BWloy09TWj@NBA @OrlandoMagic @DetroitPistons WORLD GREATEST TANK BATTLE@OrlandoMagic I gotta question Magic fans. Why the Magic Instagram limit comments on their posts🤔The whole “Jim Harbaugh leaving Michigan” thing is the exact same as the Penny Hardaway leaving Memphis for the Orlando Magic over the summer.

Penny used the possibility of the NBA as leverage to get what he wanted from Memphis.

Detroit Pistons (7-30) vs Orlando Magic (7-32)

Here a little late because of the overtime game in Bowling Green, but a nice arena and since the teams are bad a nice ticket price for lower bowl seats. 

Also, why the hell are the Magic wearing black and orange jerseys? https://t.co/lNBcJoQY0G@The_ColeAnthony won't be denied the 3 pointer he wanted.

What he wants he gets!

Great Ball movement @OrlandoMagic
