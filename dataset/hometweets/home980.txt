THIS DAY IN SPORTS HISTORY, with a VERY personal twist: 1958 ‚Äî George Yardley of the Detroit Pistons becomes the first NBA player to score 2,000 points in a season.

#Pistons #NBA75 #NBA #NBATwitter #NBAInformatics@NickeyDyme @DetroitPistons I can‚Äôt wait to see how he adjusts on an NBA level once he gets a bit more mass on him. A healthy AD, Giannis, etc are going to manhandle him and eat his ass up.@karasoon4 @DetroitPistons He considers himself a point forward like Durant. If he played in the SEC he‚Äôd be a slightly better version of Walker Kessler.@NickeyDyme @DetroitPistons My first time watching him and I couldn‚Äôt agree more. He is too weak all around to be able to have the lateral movement necessary to be a stretch 5 as I assume he will be used. It‚Äôs painful watching him move around the court! Could prove us wrong, but I‚Äôm just not seeing it.@TallBrian11 @DetroitPistons üòÇ Man that‚Äôd be awesomeChet Holmgren has bust written all over him. He‚Äôs gonna be a journeyman in NBA. He‚Äôs too weak to guard centers and pfs and too slow to guard the guards and small forwards. I pray my @DetroitPistons don‚Äôt draft him.When she's a big NBA fan - but loves the Pistons! #Detroit #Pistons https://t.co/Ml1SbO5pNN@KeithGave @DetroitRedWings They need to get some basketballs from the @DetroitPistons and start from there!@NoahRadigan @BradenHetzel @NBA @CadeCunningham_ You realize Cade missed a bunch of games to start the season, and the @DetroitPistons have won 6 of their last 8@Rothstein420 @DetroitPistons Idk man tbh I can‚Äôt see the difference@DetroitPistons @MobHoops @CadeCunningham_ @Acronis @ccare_ccr1 Mobley does this 3x every game ü•±@greggkrupa @DetroitPistons That‚Äôs a tight group of ballers right there. üèÄdave debusschere

Max max play!@DRWFan92360244 @greggkrupa @NBA @DetroitRedWings @DetroitPistons I loved watching the Pistons grow into the Bad Boys at the ‚ÄúSilverdome‚Äù.  Hated having to drive to Pontiac from the city though. @IsiahThomas@KevinOConnorNBA @ChrisVernonShow Thank you for not overlooking the @DetroitPistons @KevinOConnorNBA@Heroplenty @greggkrupa @NBA @DetroitRedWings @DetroitPistons Pistons should play at Ford Field because why not, what else is going on during those dates?

They played at the Silverdome!@greggkrupa @NBA I can‚Äôt stand that the @DetroitRedWings and @DetroitPistons share the same arena.  Shameful that the Pistons owner clearly doesn‚Äôt care; He‚Äôd rather glom onto the Illitch‚Äôs stake, and they don‚Äôt care either just as long as their trust funds are secure. #Baseball@FirstTake @MollyQerim Thank you for being a sportscaster. Thank you for always keeping a level head. Thank you for marrying my favorite Wolverine! (I saw his father play for the Detroit Pistons.) Thank you for being you. God bless you and your family.
