Can’t tell me he wasn’t the best center isn’t he game for 5/6 years. Just because he’s not that player anymore and he had his issues post Orlando doesn’t mean you take away from what he did when he was a Magic. https://t.co/CTBnnpd0j9@BallyHEAT @MiamiHEAT Hey @BallySports, tell me why I couldn’t see the Heat last night (I live in Orlando) and the Magic weren’t even playing? Why was kickboxing on both Florida and Sun?As a LeBron and former Cavs fan, those late 2000s Orlando Magic teams used to give me nightmares.

https://t.co/4spxOy4SCU@OrlandoMagic NBA hates the Orlando Magic.. no only did they disrespect Tracy McGrady they screw us in the lottery so we can never get a great player againThe truth is out
The orlando magic are the literal Black sheep of the NBA

For our 2 times we knocked off finals destined teams in the East

To having a lot of iconic players go nearly supernova on our rosters.
No one accepts us https://t.co/EKgsDxh66u@OrlandoMagic let me get a 10-day contract. 🥺People really be forgetting Dwight Howard took the Orlando Magic to the finals5 former @OrlandoMagic players.  There's no respect for any of our former players https://t.co/ijlcESwO7sYa’ll must have forgot.

You said he never needed a 3-1 comeback but he needed these other ones??Loved hosting @SpecSports360 tonight! Tons of great stuff from @BriMacNaught @LHSportsTV @KennyMoralesTV &amp; @therealBeede  It’s going to be a great weekend for sports in Orlando! The Magic home opener, UCF back at the Bounce House and week 9 of high school football! Can’t wait 😊 https://t.co/3UKTjktxnV@BeORLMagic @NBA @OrlandoMagic That being said, they all should be  on there before Anthony Davis.dwight howard took the orlando magic to the finals at 24 but apparently isn’t a top 75 player ever@Nlippitt10 I wouldn’t value the block award here as much when comparing, but the defensive team awards and the fact that he led the Magic to an appearance are certainly valid. It’s almost as if the journalist who tweeted this should have included his run to the finals with Orlando as well.@BeORLMagic @NBA @OrlandoMagic All were great players for a short time.  I think that’s the difference.  Vince had a long career, but wasn’t an all star much.How is a 3x DPOY and multiple MVP front runner not in the top 75, the NBA hates the Orlando Magic@FreakiRicky @danfavale @OrlandoMagic The Timberwolves would like a conversation@OrlandoMagic It's like the NBA just kept giving the middle finger to Orlando. Dwight most definitely belongs on this list at least.been looking forward to the magic of a typical Disney vacation after a tough year of pandemic lockdowns and loss, but were left feeling very unhappy with many aspects of our most recent trip.
When we first arrived at Orlando International airport we were eager to take advantageall 4 losses will be from the orlando magicWhose absence from the Top 75 bothered you the most? 

I'll start with mine: Dwight Howard, Kemba Walker, Gail Goodrich

Dwight at no point in his career has ever been unstoppable. STOP THIS MADNESS !!! https://t.co/SGm73XT9vw@KendrickPerkins I know big perk. 💪🏾😂. You played against prime Orlando magic Dwight, that dude was a problem. 😂@ReginaldMadiso4 @nihilist_bucks Y'all must be young, or never play the game of basketball any respectable level in your life. Multiple contending teams offered Vince Carter a contract, and he went to the Eastern conference finals with the Orlando magic. This man lifted an expansion team to respectability.@russ48239 @jmunderwood64 @aldairlewis26 @NekiasNBA You clearly didn't see Dwight in Orlando if that's your take. He brought a horrible Magic team to the finals.I didn't understand the game as I understand it now, so I was very confused then. But he wasn't the same guy.

Also, that series vs the Magic was a lot closer than most remember. Boston won G2 in Orlando and then they were right there to close out the Garden in Games 3 and 4. https://t.co/bVaOmChuqLYeah Dwight Howard Should Of Made That List. Prime Orlando Magic Dwight was A Problem. 💪🏾😂. Those guys and women didn’t voted him cause they don’t like him. 😂@OrlandoMagic Just put a big snubbed banner on it! We would still appreciate the effort... and in our eyes they should be there anyway!@GoinHAM9HD @CTowersCBS Curry was unanimous in ‘16. Westbrook and Harden were the far and away 1-2.   I like Kawhi a lot and his Toronto season was absolutely Jordan-esque. I also don’t think Howard should be on it either. And I’m a Magic fan. He hasn’t been anything since leaving Orlando@jonathanigoat @Aly61698381 @chumabucket @Corey_Dickerson @TheNBACentral I can assure you that no one sane desires to know anything about the Orlando magic. And god bless the sorry bastards who do@mikecoleTSE @NBAPR @NBA Yeah them back problems from have the @OrlandoMagic &amp; @HoustonRockets on his back all them years lol@OrlandoMagic @OrlandoMagic out here making graphics for 6 Magic legends and only one got used 😕Five Orlando Players.

Orlando is pretty much purgatory.@BleacherReport dwight howard didn’t carry the pathetic orlando magic to the finals by himself for dame to make the top 75 list over himSimply put the greatest of all time and as a fan of the Boston Celtics and Orlando Magic thorn in my side but still the goat #Bulls #nba75 https://t.co/1NRongAj0y@BeORLMagic @NBA @OrlandoMagic All talented with unfinished careers. No chips or major injuries could have got in the way.

From 07-12 at Dwight peak he was at no point lower than being considered a top 5 player. He has 4 straight season of top 5 mvp voting.Dwight Howard led the *Orlando Magic* to the NBA Finals &amp; beat LeBron James along the way, but he’s not one of the 75 greatest players in NBA history? The committee is goofy for leaving him off.@MadBorneX @juwinyou @gavinman0814 @basketbllnews 2/2 the Celtics series were during jordan 1st and second year of I remember correctly and didn’t he drop 63 in a game against them and still lost? The Orlando magic series was like Jordan’s first month back to basketball after being gone for like 2 years, and the pistons just wonPeople forgot how competitive the Orlando Magic were when Dwight Howard was on the team.@jackfrank_jjf Recency bias and politics are blocking the Orlando Magic version of Dwight Howard out of this list. That’s okay, keep using your physicality deep in the paint to add a 2nd NBA Championship to your resume.The Orlando Magic never get any love.
