Woj already listed the teams in heavy pursuit of Dragic and the Heat were not listedWhat I've appreciated most from this @MiamiHEAT team is that they've taken care of business against teams they should beat.

I think it's what seperates them from the other top teams...they rarely beat themselves.

Dragic deserves a chip especially with miami, 2020 could have been heat champs if it wernt for injuries and miami has a good chance of getting it this year. Then next year he'll go somewhere elseQOTD: The correct answer from yesterday was D. Zhaire Smith. On June 21, 2018, Smith was selected with the sixteenth overall pick by the Phoenix Suns in the 2018 NBA draft, but was immediately traded, along with the Miami Heat's 2021 first round pick, to the Philadelphia 76ers https://t.co/0aEH07mxQc@Kenny16Techs It's for the culture. Why do Heat fans think we keep Udonis for? And if he'll agree not getting a lot of playing time, that's great.

Even if they waive Highsmith, he’s still owed his money. They wouldn’t throw away money for the heck of it. Clearest evidence Miami has not been pursuing Dragić. https://t.co/pHY0A3LWn2Added to the injury list for the Mavs this morning, Reggie Bullock. He's doubtful for tonight's game in Miami with a left hip contusion. Hardaway, Chriss, and Pinson were already listed as out for Mavs vs Heat (630p, BSSW).Important note: Miami CAN buy out the 10-day at any time. So, if the is mutual interest in a Dragic return, then the Heat could easily create the extra roster spot. https://t.co/fxASTHc3syI want Goran Dragic back just because he deserves to win a ring with the Miami Heat… Period.Congratulations to pshkins and lemurbeast who moved up to take #20 and #23 on the Miami Heat team leaderboard.

And don’t @ me trying to make sense now if you were just spending last week saying the Heat should trade their starting shooting guard for “injury insurance”Bring him home! @MiamiHEAT https://t.co/fCJBancG3PIn wake of trading deadline, Heat back on the NBA clock, as deadlines loom #Miami #Heat #NBA https://t.co/YN39rMzoLF@brooklynfritzy Poll question suggestion - This time next year, the next most likely title town/area: 1. Wisconsin (Bucks, Packers), 2. Arizona (Suns, Cardinals, Wildcats), 3. Miami, FL (Heat, Panthers, Dolphins).I don’t want him taking minutes from Gabe or Tyler, but I find it hard to believe Heat fans wouldn’t want the narrative of Gogi coming back to Miami on a reduced role.  Who are you signing at this point that is better? https://t.co/X0cGiFvaqy@ShamsCharania @TheAthletic @Stadium @MiamiHEAT bring him backIf anyone replaces Harden, it should be Tyler Herro.

I’m going to guess the Heat https://t.co/Ulr27Xx7M4Heat traded Dragić away and then offered his jersey number instantly to another PG.

But by altering terms on the No. 1 pick due Oklahoma City, Miami now can trade its first-round pick in 2022 or its first-round pick in 2023. https://t.co/TvDSHAstGqBam Adebayo Has To Continue To Take This Look For The Miami Heat – NBA News https://t.co/GU3xcUeYuMWow this is surprising I didn't know any Miami heat fans went to games. https://t.co/m8tc0r0V97list of some of my favorite commentators (by team):

Allen shouldn’t have been chosen over Pascal, cause clearly winning doesn’t actually matter. #NBAAllStar #NBA75Ive had this conversation with people here for years.. man ever since I found out about the Miami Heat organization I just fell in love with them, and Wade was always my favorite player… that loyalty never wavered.. im always gonna ride with them first..

They’re the one seed because of depth and system and great roster construction. Cavs are a top seed because of Darius Garland, Jarret Allen and Mobley. JA was the better of the bigs.
