TS: JimmyBuckets1988@FirstTake @stephenasmith @jj_redick How do you say a team's window has closed when they're young, dominating, have won 16 straight and are one of the best teams in the league? I get it--Golden State with Steph and Klay are beasts--but the Suns aren't the Sacramento Kings.Don’t forget $ankr will be in the spotlight tonight with @Lakers playing @SacramentoKings

Plus a new month is upon us.

No doubt in my mind $ankr reaches ATH within the next week.

Nothing changes until that occurs.The #Kings are home dogs hosting the #Lakers tonight and that has been a rough spot for Sacramento.  

The Kings are 0-7 ATS (and 0-7 overall) since April 28 as home dogs of more than 2 points.  

#SDQL #NBA #NBATwitter #LakeShow #Lakersnation https://t.co/w8wn8bBMo1Crazy fact of the day “you can get a ticket to the @SacramentoKings game cheaper then you can get a Big Mac combo from McDonald’s “!! Sad sadOne thing has been clear this season, the Sacramento Kings’ roster isn’t capable of competing at the moment.

The question is, how should the team approach the trade market?Despite shooting 0-for-5 from deep against the Kings last Friday, Davis is going to be fed in the paint. Sacramento allows 51.9 points in the paint per game this season; the most in the league.Houston Rockets
