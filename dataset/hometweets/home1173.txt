#RipCity #PorVida https://t.co/EgdQrUvLtUIf San Antonio wins tonight, the Lakers would have to go 4-0 and Spurs would have to go 1-3 or the Lakers would have to go 3-1 and the Spurs go 0-4. The Lakers haven’t won back to back games since January.If the Lakers go 3-1 the rest of the way, assuming the Spurs beat Portland today, San Antonio would need to go 1-3 in their final 4 games. https://t.co/4uiGlteoamIn that same season 2015-2016 the San Antonio Spurs finished in the West with 67 wins behind Golden States league leading 73 and neither were  the team to win it all that season.

The 2015-2016 season champions were the 57 win Cleveland Cavaliers lead by Lebron James.Lakers will drop to two games behind the Spurs for 10th in the West if San Antonio wins tonight against the Blazers 

Nikola Jokic 38 pts 18 reb 6 ast in the Nuggets win over the LALIf the Pelicans win tonight, they will move too far in front of the Lakers for the 9-seed, meaning Los Angeles can only possibly claim the 10-seed.

If the Spurs win tonight, the Lakers will be two full games behind San Antonio, who also owns the tiebreaker, with 4 games left.Daaaaaaaa Lakers lose!

Magic Number: 3

Any combination of three Spurs wins and Lakers losses sends San Antonio to the play-in.
