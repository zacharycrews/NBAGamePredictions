Letting IT go and signing Kyrie was not ideal. IT had been a person of integrity, loyal and trustworthy

I totally agree with Mego on @celtics It‚Äôs time for the players to be held accountable. ‚ÄúYou are what your record says you are!‚Äù
It‚Äôs a bad mix of players. No leaders at all. This is an @NBA issue, but magnified on the Celtics. No leadership!@LeftLad15 You getting a 10 day with the @celtics ?@celtics @jaytatum0 All while we suck and this roster yet again needs a clean out more than my intestines do‚Ä¶..@celtics @rob_williamsIII @TDBank_US Only to be wasted by BALL-HOGGERS.The Boston Celtics have fallen to 16-19 and are the No. 11 seed in the Eastern Conference. #CelticsTier 1: Charlotte Hornets
