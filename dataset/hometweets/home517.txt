#AllTheVideos #TeamPlay #Passing #Assists #Etc@Jake20003317 @celtics Agree, would pick Romeo over J Rich.@JKorpusinski @celtics My question to you is how happy and satisfied you are with the product you have now? 
Past glories is relevant in the now 
Letting IT go and signing Kyrie was not ideal. IT had been a person of integrity, loyal and trustworthy 
Rest my case@Crandal16196062 @celtics Totally agree! Anyone can score 30 points on 36 3s. If anyone else shot 1-13  on 3s they would be benched immediately.@Otaldotchola @celtics Right...sit Horford for Grant.@chadgoetz1 @celtics Right....why are they exempt from criticism?@celtics Struggle from behind the arc every night but 9% from three point shooting more than 40 Threes come on Celt's...Plenty of room for improvement after the @celtics' L to the Clippers last night.  No question.  But, some solid and encouraging words here from Souichi Terada (@SouichiTerada / @masslivenews) about Brodric Thomas's (@TheReal__BT3) contributions. https://t.co/1TdBng39SX https://t.co/W24NMizUxt@AmericanJakk @celtics I don't know much!
What was wrong in keeping IT by resigning him even though some haters would say that is past glories etc. Compared to the product that you now have I'll say IT. WAS A KEEPER 
AND NOT Kyrie Irving. Danny Ainge 
Know that it should consider robbery 
How IT left@celtics 4/41 ??? Cmon family …@Home_Brodie @celtics @rob_williamsIII @TDBank_US Quit looking at the box score and watch the game. Everyone complains of defense, but Romeo is the only one defending with the exception of Rob.@coachmatthews26 @celtics Go inside more????? 😉😁⛹️‍♂️@PSquad35 @TheEJB15 @celticsblog Again, the Boston Celtics will not trade Jaylen Brown for Ben Simmons. Simmons’ trade value is low because of how he has handled this situation.

Derrick White is great too but he’s not at their level yet. @lakers don’t really have anything realistic to trade to @trailblazers but @celtics may give Marcus smart away for a player and two picks.@nyknicks .@nyknicks opening night double OT W over @celtics 🔥🔥@JKorpusinski @celtics Right on at least one is bold enough to make a true statement.@AmericanJakk @celtics Understood...Just talking shooting percentages.

Shake up!!!@StoolGreenie As a @celtics fan, it’s pain but at this point am not interested in trading either All-Star. More concerned with the coaching. It’s almost half-way through the season and we still can’t understand when a player earns minutes, he gets benched in crunch time?! #mindboggling@AmericanJakk @celtics Sir J ! Please someone, anyone would you justify the releasing of IT by the Celtics and the signing of Kyrie who then turned and made a mockery of the Celtics pride. I concluded with the saying that Danny A didn't appreciate the gift neither the giver of the gift
