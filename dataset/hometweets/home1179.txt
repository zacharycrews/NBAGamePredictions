It actually benefits the Hornets to have the Nets keep pace with them because Charlotte owns the tiebreaker over Brooklyn and the 3-way tiebreaker. https://t.co/9eZ3JCTIZX@BrooklynNets @KDTrey5 kyrie jacket got robbed by someone in the process@RobUrenko1 @JTFOz I personally like it. Brooklyn isn't so great defending SGs (bottom 8 on the year), although they have been better with Kyrie playing all games now and not just road games but the kid is gonna have to score in bunches to keep up with Nets. I like it at o23.5. Volume will be there@BrooklynNets @KDTrey5 So fireIt almost certainly won't happen, but I definitely want the Rockets to beat the Nets tonight.

Houston is locked into a bottom 2 record already and likely won't finish with the worst record, regardless. A loss could really hurt Brooklyn- let's have some funCan Brooklyn Nets become the First 10-Placed Team to Win an NBA Championship?

Players like KD, Steph and Kyrie usually meet the requirements for 50/40/90 30 to 40 games into the season. From that point onwards, they just need  to maintain the shooting splits.Ziti sports

KD was already a 50/40/90 in 2013 with 81 games played so what's your point...Go think the Brooklyn Nets could be in play-in, wow!!!

Nash's inexperience &amp; lack of game-time adjuster shows up this season &amp; it hurt the #Nets

Nash coaching was awful

#NetsWorld #NetsLevel@SNYNets This is a great slogan for the Nets 21/22 season.

The Brooklyn Nets: Who Cares@my_surreal_life @TheRealJRSmith @Michael8easley @BrooklynNets 🤣🤣🤣🤣all ny teams be buggingNets Urged Hire 8-Time All-Star Replace Steve Nash as HCoach

Nope - I will urge #BrooklynNets to hire Warriors Assist Mike Brown at the end seasons

Brown coach's Kevin Durant &amp; Kyrie Irving &amp; has HC experience

NY mandated vaccines and Kyrie was not allowed, to play full time. The NBA, did not mandate vaccines. Kyrie never breach his contract with Brooklyn Nets.
What Kyrie did, was refused, to take vaccines. OpinionTuesday’s matchup between the Rockets and Nets is fascinating from a 2022 NBA draft perspective, since either result brings a benefit to Houston (which owns Brooklyn’s first-round pick).  https://t.co/GkRMzXhA5c@TheAlexSousa @SteveNash @StephenCurry30 @KDTrey5 @ESPNNBA @ESPNStatsInfo @espn @YESNetwork @BrooklynNets But will it count because he hasn’t played enough games.@ProfessorDrz on @JoelEmbiid "politics", the @BrooklynNets issues, his @NBA Final 4 &amp; mo'.  Listen LIVE NOW w/@Ianfitzespn on Freddie &amp; Fitzsimmons on @ESPNRadio the ESPN App, @SIRIUSXM Channel 80 &amp; @tunein   #letthegoodtimesroll https://t.co/6RHQ8YQRjr@Kil889 That's because his teammates consists of one guy who let his ignorance of vaccinations keep him from playing almost all year, then the Nets traded for a player who has "mental issues" that won't even step on the court. KD is doomed no matter what happens in Brooklyn.@FirstTake @stephenasmith If, Kyrie was in breach of his contract, with Brooklyn Nets and you or Magic 
was against that, you both would have some validity. Do not confuse the laws, with emotions. Opinion@AndrewYang @kulturec @EvelynYang @drjudith @BrooklynNets Holy hell yang, couldn’t put on a pair of clean pants for this event YEESH BRUH https://t.co/0t7HmsSBlM@FirstTake @stephenasmith Stephen A, you have Magic on your show, to validate your baseless take
on Kyrie not being vaccinated. Kyrie 
duty, is to honor his contract, with Brooklyn Nets. No where, in contract
stated, Kyrie Irving must be vaccinated.
It is disingenuous, for you or Magic, to mislead folks.@hernesman @SBondyNYDN @BrooklynNets Your silly terms don't mean dog shit to me. Hope you got that too! 😐 #WashYourHandsOnYourWayOut@BrooklynNets @KDTrey5 @_claxton33 @KyrieIrving James Johnson and Patty Mills fired@BleacherReport Until he gets his 20 Million from @sixers @BrooklynNets Ben isn’t playing. His back injury magically is worst than they thought. Let’s not forget he had back issues before.

Every post I see mentions a different injury. 
#BrooklynNetsThis man is stressed and unhappy. @joetsai1999 @BrooklynNets @JeriTsaiNets Durant deserves the keys to the team. Basically let him choose the coach and the players and go to work. Can't be wasting the best of the best player in the NBA https://t.co/caVJdSkrnFThe reason the @BrooklynNets have quietly maneuvered @BenSimmons25 to the 'will not pkay' list this year is because it would have been embarrassing in the playoffs watching the Nets lose 18 point leads bc the other team just  keeps fouling Simmons 😁
@sixers@BrooklynNets @clovercommerce Steve Nash needs to resign ASAP. Enough is enough.@BrooklynNets @clovercommerce What hustle man this team is broken AF.@zhengjy997 @DanielA93676249 @BrooklynNets @KDTrey5 @_claxton33 @KyrieIrving Nothing is easy with this team, have you noticed their play lately? The Pistons also had nothing to play for, we barely beat them. Any team would love to beat KD and the Nets@Assong_A @jt2304_jt1997 @SteveNash @StephenCurry30 @KDTrey5 @ESPNNBA @ESPNStatsInfo @espn @YESNetwork @BrooklynNets Kyrie made it last year with 54 games.
