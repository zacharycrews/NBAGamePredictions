It actually benefits the Hornets to have the Nets keep pace with them because Charlotte owns the tiebreaker over Brooklyn and the 3-way tiebreaker. https://t.co/9eZ3JCTIZX@BrooklynNets @KDTrey5 kyrie jacket got robbed by someone in the process@RobUrenko1 @JTFOz I personally like it. Brooklyn isn't so great defending SGs (bottom 8 on the year), although they have been better with Kyrie playing all games now and not just road games but the kid is gonna have to score in bunches to keep up with Nets. I like it at o23.5. Volume will be there@BrooklynNets @KDTrey5 So fireIt almost certainly won't happen, but I definitely want the Rockets to beat the Nets tonight.

NY mandated vaccines and Kyrie was not allowed, to play full time. The NBA, did not mandate vaccines. Kyrie never breach his contract with Brooklyn Nets.
What Kyrie did, was refused, to take vaccines. OpinionTuesday‚Äôs matchup between the Rockets and Nets is fascinating from a 2022 NBA draft perspective, since either result brings a benefit to Houston (which owns Brooklyn‚Äôs first-round pick).  https://t.co/GkRMzXhA5c@TheAlexSousa @SteveNash @StephenCurry30 @KDTrey5 @ESPNNBA @ESPNStatsInfo @espn @YESNetwork @BrooklynNets But will it count because he hasn‚Äôt played enough games.@ProfessorDrz on @JoelEmbiid "politics", the @BrooklynNets issues, his @NBA Final 4 &amp; mo'.

KD is doomed no matter what happens in Brooklyn.@FirstTake @stephenasmith If, Kyrie was in breach of his contract, with Brooklyn Nets and you or Magic 
was against that, you both would have some validity. Do not confuse the laws, with emotions.

on Kyrie not being vaccinated. Kyrie 
duty, is to honor his contract, with Brooklyn Nets. No where, in contract
stated, Kyrie Irving must be vaccinated.
It is disingenuous, for you or Magic, to mislead folks.@hernesman @SBondyNYDN @BrooklynNets Your silly terms don't mean dog shit to me.
