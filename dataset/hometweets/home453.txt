That's why the fouls ring up so fast. &amp; when you're hot, don't force your shots (my high school coach preached that). The Kobe-thing is a killer. I love DB but I too am not blind to criticizing him.@memgrizz he play？？@J_Timberfake_ @GhostofOtara @memgrizz Period! Preached it, believe it. I'm proud of JV for still holding his own. Hated that he went to NOLA, (I think Golden State or even the Knicks would've suited him better) but I understand.@TheRoyalJoshua @GhostofOtara @memgrizz Perseverance pays a price!@GhostofOtara @TheRoyalJoshua @memgrizz Here’s ideal Dillon:

Physical taxing defense on the other team’s big wing player. 
Drive to the rim or spot up catch and shoot threes

4th on team in shots (10-12 per)@J_Timberfake_ @GhostofOtara @memgrizz And I'm about a year behind you. I was a kid, but I was still here. I could never forget the bullying I took for wearing Grizz gear at school instead of LAL, Philly (Iverson era) and Boston.@TheRoyalJoshua @GhostofOtara @memgrizz This is the first year JV hasn’t had an awesome point guard too. And they are next to last. Point guards matter most@GhostofOtara @memgrizz @J_Timberfake_ Didn't like the comparisons. It wasn't fare and Adams was in a bad situation in NOLA. JV is still doing great, but Adams feeds from a strong point guard. They didn't understand that and thus I got roasted lol. Adams is doing great here, that's for sure.@TheRoyalJoshua @GhostofOtara @memgrizz I’ve been a Grizz fan since the days they literally gave away tickets to get people to come to games. The Stro show, J Will and Mike Miller. 

The Dillon that showed up in the first LAC match up is a Dillon I’d love to have nightly.@TheRoyalJoshua @GhostofOtara @memgrizz I’m with you on this train@TheRoyalJoshua @GhostofOtara @memgrizz No one has questioned me about being a Grizz fan haha.@GhostofOtara @memgrizz @J_Timberfake_ And you weren't here for this, but I went to war for Adams over the JV trade, saying that he'll match the speed of the current Grizz squad. I got roasted but...I was right. The Grizz are a way better team with Adams &amp; that's not a joke either &amp; I love JV. I just got frustrated.Oklahoma City Thunder @ Memphis Grizzlies

#NBA #handicapper #coding #financialliteracy@TheRoyalJoshua @GhostofOtara @memgrizz @J_Timberfake_ I would say most of us had moments of hating Dillon prior to this season. He’s cemented himself as the defensive captain and that’s made me like him a lot more on the court. He’s gotten better at avoiding Kobe cosplay but he still falls into it on occasion and I can’t stand itHere for the Ja-rm up video @memgrizz@jamorantfan23 @memgrizz @cintronworld since when did i ask@GhostofOtara @memgrizz @J_Timberfake_ He's already tagged. Look above.^@GhostofOtara @memgrizz @J_Timberfake_ You have to earn it. It might not mean anything to him, but @J_Timberfake_ earned my respect a LONG time ago. Even if we don't disagree, we have had debates that have equaled out to us shaking hands online. I don't like many of his takes but he's an excellent writer &amp; a good man.@jamorantfan23 @memgrizz @cintronworld since when@jamorantfan23 @memgrizz @cintronworld when u get owned@memgrizz No sadly@jamorantfan23 @memgrizz @cintronworld i didnt give my opinion, however you inferred it@badams2s @memgrizz Happy birthday to himMemphis Grizzlies tab Ja Morant as questionable vs OKC Thunder https://t.co/am99YcwsJG@jamorantfan23 @memgrizz @cintronworld for what@jamorantfan23 @memgrizz @cintronworld i said i asked them@jamorantfan23 @memgrizz @cintronworld obviously you bozo i asked them@jamorantfan23 @memgrizz @cintronworld i didnt ask you@memgrizz @cintronworld First thing i thought of 😆 https://t.co/eriTpugEwy@GhostofOtara @memgrizz @J_Timberfake_ But despite his takes on Brooks, he is a Grizz fan through and through and I respect him on that.

I just sat back and read while sipping on some Wine.@memgrizz @dillonbrooks24 24 points, follow me if to happen@memgrizz @cintronworld change caption@GhostofOtara @memgrizz @J_Timberfake_ You do know that he has gardened criticism from fellow Grizz writers and fans for his takes specifically on Brooks, right?

The hustle and determination in this team is amazing@memgrizz @dillonbrooks24 9 + 10. take that how u want@GhostofOtara @memgrizz No, I watched him. I'm an NBA fan before anything. Steven Adams had a good game, but it wouldn't have been enough for a win last night. Accept it and move on.@TaylorDvdson @Alexis_Benson23 @memgrizz I never know what’s going on until I’m there!@amshinee When we (Memphis Grizzlies) played the Kings the other night &amp; the announcers mentioned his involvement in a play, I felt bad for where my mind went. We know far more about his d___s life than we do his basketball skills.@GhostofOtara @memgrizz @J_Timberfake_ Dillon haters are probably some of the most irrelevant, non-educated basketball fans out there. On par with LeBron haters, KD haters, and Curry haters. Nothing to brag about and nothing to be taken seriously. Good luck, but most Grizz fans would destroy you guys.🤣🤣@GhostofOtara @memgrizz I seem to remember him hitting 20/10's nearly every night one season. You're not the only one who has watched him since he arrived. My point is that's not his absolute best. Steven Adams is way better than that. It's not criticism, it's me knowing he's better.@HungryTiger901 @memgrizz @dillonbrooks24 Ppl usually go on streaks after a game like this so I’d say 27+@kelwright @memgrizz @dillonbrooks24 That’s a little stretch.

But love your enthusiasm@memgrizz @dillonbrooks24 day 1 of me asking for a fb (check my pinned btw)@memgrizz No. But it is my wife's@GhostofOtara @memgrizz @J_Timberfake_ So about two people who are known Dillon haters. That's your large portion?😂😂😂@memgrizz Y’all been killing with those! 🔥@memgrizz Thanks!!@unoCP_ photoshop. it's about 50 burst photos into one.@GhostofOtara @memgrizz Wow! That stat barely scratches his OKC days. I've seen better, but if that's all you're relying on, then I was right, we would've got blown out by thirty had Brooks struggled like everyone else. Goodnight. I'm getting ready for the game, where I'll be cheering on everybody.@GhostofOtara @TheRoyalJoshua @memgrizz Like he got torched for 32 points and 5 fouls last night. Shot below 50% but let’s ignore that bc he scored 37 points and he screams and yells. As much has he had the ball and only got 3 assists? Just not my flavor of teaThe Memphis Grizzlies have recorded 11 consecutive games with 10+ steals.

The last NBA team with a longer streak was the 1997-98 Boston Celtics, who had a 16-game run from February 25 - March 29, 1998.@memgrizz @dillonbrooks24 22 points 7 rebounds 4 assists@GhostofOtara @memgrizz Sure, I'm in denial. Excuse me if I don't take advice from a grown man who's too lazy to spell out the word "you." You're a waste man. Do me and yourself a favor and stay the hell off my posts. Go be annoying somewhere else. If I wanted your opinion trust me, I would ask.@GhostofOtara @memgrizz That portion must be on Facebook. I went to their open practice where they allowed fans to come and watch. Dillion got more and louder cheers than Ja, which is how I know you're lying. That portion is about 0.1% and they do not matter at all. So good luck with preaching that.Chicago Bulls - Houston Rockets
Memphis Grizzlies - Oklahoma City Thunder

Bet slip link: https://t.co/aFVse7WjfY https://t.co/GRvYLDAwSw@GhostofOtara @memgrizz I don't know what portion you're talking about, but Dillion Brooks is the beloved player in Memphis, arguably up there with Ja. You're lying to yourself. Again, when you're tasked with paying D on Damian Lillard and scoring, you mess up. If y'all hate that then you're not a fan.@memgrizz The 🐐 Has Returned https://t.co/8FoigwasDP@nbattack @memgrizz Their defense has stepped up since Ja was out@badams2s @memgrizz He got to visit Ja Raffe!!!@memgrizz @dillonbrooks24 Imma say he drops 26@goldmedalmobley @memgrizz @dillonbrooks24 Cavs fan lmao@GhostofOtara @memgrizz Because they weren't. They play better than that, even Steven Adams. If Dillon didn't even have the 4th quarter like it played out, the Blazers would've blown us out by 30. Dillon was also playing defense on Dame, arguably one of the greatest clutch players ever. It's cool.@memgrizz Thank you 😊 🤗🥰@memgrizz @dillonbrooks24 you a goatfresh off a career high 37 point performance. 

@dillonbrooks24 will have ________ points tonight 🦹‍♂️ https://t.co/8ZQ74iVMy6If miles bridges gets traded to Memphis, Grizzlies will definitely be my favorite team to watch@GhostofOtara @memgrizz Me saying all that doesn't mean I'm emotional at all. I don't think you even know what that means. I'm telling you to basically get a life. I'm sorry that you really think that you're that important to me, I'm flattered, but you're not. Sorry bud.@GhostofOtara @memgrizz Maybe because you're busy being nosy and trying to look for problems that isn't there. Adams is okay and nobody is shitting on him. Literally nobody. You don't even follow many Grizzly accounts so no wonder. You need to get involve in GrizzNation more.@memgrizz HAHA DONT ACT LIKE YALL DIDNT JUST RETWEET AN F BOMB WE GOT NOTIFICATIONS ON 

Go grizz tho@memgrizz Next month, but man they sure do come early and often these days it seems!  🤔@TheRoyalJoshua @memgrizz Man… you can’t tell people to go have sex with them, you sound like jealous husbands, go touch grass, etc etc and then say you’re not emotional lol I’m just saying. No hate. I’m just using the ammo that u gave me.@GhostofOtara @memgrizz Yeah, I am a Bisexual and proud and yet I'm not here defending a dude like I'm his Husband. Dillon was carrying the load on BOTH ends when everybody else couldn't find their strides. And that's okay, every player has those moments. But what you're doing is ridiculous.@memgrizz Boy do I need Ja to win MIP for financial reasons. Welcome back 12!@memgrizz Go time@GhostofOtara @memgrizz "Not a goodnight" doesn't mean "trash." That's where your reading fundamentals come in. Dillion had a very goodnight, everyone else didn't compared to their normal performances which you can find on a stat sheet. I don't see where you found a problem with that.@zach_edens @memgrizz Normally about an hour before@memgrizz HES BACK@GhostofOtara @memgrizz Yeah, I do. You're very toxic. I'm not spreading any Steven Adams hate. You can look on my page, there's nothing regarding hatred for Steven Adams. There's a difference between criticism &amp; hate. I criticize, I don't hate Steven Adams or anyone. You need go touch some fresh grass.Back OKLAHOMA CITY THUNDER to BEAT Memphis Grizzlies tonight in the @NBA (Game Starts at 01.10 GMT) #NBA #Basketball@GhostofOtara @memgrizz And I'm not emotional. I don't get emotional on Twitter, it's not worth the energy and neither are you. I'm more "confused" than anything. Dillon was the star last night &amp; I gave him praise. That's it. The rest of the team lagged behind and that's cool. It happens. No criticism.@TheRoyalJoshua @memgrizz Toxic? You wanna talk about toxic? Hahahahahq@TheRoyalJoshua @memgrizz But you are right tho Dillon deserves praise. I just found issue that u said everyone else was trash when Adams was just as good, if not consistently better.@memgrizz today is my first game. when do the gates open?@GhostofOtara @memgrizz I got a better question, why are you always on my posts every time I'm talking about Steven Adams? You can be a fan without being toxic. Understand? I'm a massive Carmelo Anthony fan, but you don't see me on here being his manager and acting like a jealous husband.@TheRoyalJoshua @memgrizz Go have sex with him? You’re the proud bisexual one hahaha stop being childish with ur remarks. I’m just saying Adams was consistently good the whole game. Dillon was great for the first 3 quarters but ended up making some bad decisions towards the end.@memgrizz HES PLAYING LFGGG@TheRoyalJoshua @memgrizz Lol I’ve watched every grizzlies game this year.

@memgrizz https://t.co/h9Hgg2UtOYPortland Trail Blazers vs Memphis Grizzlies – Full Game Highlights | December 18, 2021 … – YouTube https://t.co/Z9FndmwW9HJaren Jackson Jr. has made some impressive paint protection plays as of late for the Memphis Grizzlies.

Whether he's coming up with the block itself or just being in position to pressure, he's capable of some pretty dynamic sequences. https://t.co/zI2I8ASVIk@OmarKin01119481 @grit_n_grind97 @memgrizz You might be the dumbest person on Grizz Twitter.

His contract will be a steal even if his stats never improve. Wont even be in the NBA top-100 salaries by the 4th year.

If they want to win a series they need him. But I really do think the Grizzlies consistent success without him shows he is a little bit overrated.@NBA @memgrizz Worst hair in the NBA?@slowmosbarber @NBAOfficial @memgrizz @trailblazers Its been awfulAgain, the officiating is highly unprofessional, disruptive of the game flow , and flat out not enjoyable. @NBAOfficial @memgrizz @trailblazers@NBA @memgrizz OverratedAye @memgrizz , can y’all turn the heat on in here.
