4th on team in shots (10-12 per)@J_Timberfake_ @GhostofOtara @memgrizz And I'm about a year behind you. I was a kid, but I was still here. I could never forget the bullying I took for wearing Grizz gear at school instead of LAL, Philly (Iverson era) and Boston.@TheRoyalJoshua @GhostofOtara @memgrizz This is the first year JV hasn‚Äôt had an awesome point guard too. And they are next to last. Point guards matter most@GhostofOtara @memgrizz @J_Timberfake_ Didn't like the comparisons. It wasn't fare and Adams was in a bad situation in NOLA. JV is still doing great, but Adams feeds from a strong point guard. They didn't understand that and thus I got roasted lol. Adams is doing great here, that's for sure.@TheRoyalJoshua @GhostofOtara @memgrizz I‚Äôve been a Grizz fan since the days they literally gave away tickets to get people to come to games. The Stro show, J Will and Mike Miller. 

The Dillon that showed up in the first LAC match up is a Dillon I‚Äôd love to have nightly.@TheRoyalJoshua @GhostofOtara @memgrizz I‚Äôm with you on this train@TheRoyalJoshua @GhostofOtara @memgrizz No one has questioned me about being a Grizz fan haha.@GhostofOtara @memgrizz @J_Timberfake_ And you weren't here for this, but I went to war for Adams over the JV trade, saying that he'll match the speed of the current Grizz squad. I got roasted but...I was right. The Grizz are a way better team with Adams &amp; that's not a joke either &amp; I love JV. I just got frustrated.Oklahoma City Thunder @ Memphis Grizzlies

#NBA #handicapper #coding #financialliteracy@TheRoyalJoshua @GhostofOtara @memgrizz @J_Timberfake_ I would say most of us had moments of hating Dillon prior to this season. He‚Äôs cemented himself as the defensive captain and that‚Äôs made me like him a lot more on the court. He‚Äôs gotten better at avoiding Kobe cosplay but he still falls into it on occasion and I can‚Äôt stand itHere for the Ja-rm up video @memgrizz@jamorantfan23 @memgrizz @cintronworld since when did i ask@GhostofOtara @memgrizz @J_Timberfake_ He's already tagged.

We know far more about his d___s life than we do his basketball skills.@GhostofOtara @memgrizz @J_Timberfake_ Dillon haters are probably some of the most irrelevant, non-educated basketball fans out there. On par with LeBron haters, KD haters, and Curry haters. Nothing to brag about and nothing to be taken seriously. Good luck, but most Grizz fans would destroy you guys.ü§£ü§£@GhostofOtara @memgrizz I seem to remember him hitting 20/10's nearly every night one season. You're not the only one who has watched him since he arrived. My point is that's not his absolute best. Steven Adams is way better than that. It's not criticism, it's me knowing he's better.@HungryTiger901 @memgrizz @dillonbrooks24 Ppl usually go on streaks after a game like this so I‚Äôd say 27+@kelwright @memgrizz @dillonbrooks24 That‚Äôs a little stretch.

That stat barely scratches his OKC days. I've seen better, but if that's all you're relying on, then I was right, we would've got blown out by thirty had Brooks struggled like everyone else. Goodnight. I'm getting ready for the game, where I'll be cheering on everybody.@GhostofOtara @TheRoyalJoshua @memgrizz Like he got torched for 32 points and 5 fouls last night. Shot below 50% but let‚Äôs ignore that bc he scored 37 points and he screams and yells. As much has he had the ball and only got 3 assists? Just not my flavor of teaThe Memphis Grizzlies have recorded 11 consecutive games with 10+ steals.

The last NBA team with a longer streak was the 1997-98 Boston Celtics, who had a 16-game run from February 25 - March 29, 1998.@memgrizz @dillonbrooks24 22 points 7 rebounds 4 assists@GhostofOtara @memgrizz Sure, I'm in denial. Excuse me if I don't take advice from a grown man who's too lazy to spell out the word "you." You're a waste man. Do me and yourself a favor and stay the hell off my posts. Go be annoying somewhere else. If I wanted your opinion trust me, I would ask.@GhostofOtara @memgrizz That portion must be on Facebook. I went to their open practice where they allowed fans to come and watch. Dillion got more and louder cheers than Ja, which is how I know you're lying. That portion is about 0.1% and they do not matter at all. So good luck with preaching that.Chicago Bulls - Houston Rockets

Bet slip link: https://t.co/aFVse7WjfY https://t.co/GRvYLDAwSw@GhostofOtara @memgrizz I don't know what portion you're talking about, but Dillion Brooks is the beloved player in Memphis, arguably up there with Ja. You're lying to yourself. Again, when you're tasked with paying D on Damian Lillard and scoring, you mess up.

They play better than that, even Steven Adams. If Dillon didn't even have the 4th quarter like it played out, the Blazers would've blown us out by 30. Dillon was also playing defense on Dame, arguably one of the greatest clutch players ever.

Sorry bud.@GhostofOtara @memgrizz Maybe because you're busy being nosy and trying to look for problems that isn't there. Adams is okay and nobody is shitting on him. Literally nobody.

No hate. I‚Äôm just using the ammo that u gave me.@GhostofOtara @memgrizz Yeah, I am a Bisexual and proud and yet I'm not here defending a dude like I'm his Husband.

But what you're doing is ridiculous.@memgrizz Boy do I need Ja to win MIP for financial reasons. Welcome back 12!@memgrizz Go time@GhostofOtara @memgrizz "Not a goodnight" doesn't mean "trash." That's where your reading fundamentals come in. Dillion had a very goodnight, everyone else didn't compared to their normal performances which you can find on a stat sheet. I don't see where you found a problem with that.@zach_edens @memgrizz Normally about an hour before@memgrizz HES BACK@GhostofOtara @memgrizz Yeah, I do. You're very toxic. I'm not spreading any Steven Adams hate. You can look on my page, there's nothing regarding hatred for Steven Adams. There's a difference between criticism &amp; hate.
