You don't understand what average means. 

Now you're trying to change it to banners.@DanKelley66 @TheCelticsWire @celtics Who’s crying laughing @DanKelley66 ? I am in boston. That means I can’t criticize my team? That’s what’s wrong with people like you. Have your ever said anything negative about the Celtics, or can they just do no wrong?@SamBergerShow @TheCelticsWire @celtics So either win a championship or average? Got it.@SamBergerShow @DanKelley66 @TheCelticsWire @celtics Schroder had been performing terrible recently. He was getting less and less minutes. White and Theis are going to be overall more help for the team than Kanter/Lanford/Schroder/Jrich overall. You gained an actual backup C. Al gets more rest.@DanKelley66 @TheCelticsWire @celtics Do you get banners for “getting to the ecf” Dan? No I’m seriously asking. Because every year, they tell us, “oh next year we will get over the hump”. How many more years we gonna hear this?@SamBergerShow @theTMMB22 @TheCelticsWire @celtics They have the best record in the east against winning teams.@SamBergerShow @Andrewkendo @StinkyEarl @TheCelticsWire @celtics Are “Green Teamers” Celtics fans? Ones that root for the Celtics to do well? 

They are 3-0 since you attempted to ridicule me by the way.@theTMMB22 @TheCelticsWire @celtics Omg @theTMMB22 They are the 7th seed. 
Get the duck boats ready!!!@SamBergerShow @TheCelticsWire @celtics And why are you crying laughing about the Celtics potentially getting eliminated early? Your bio says you’re in Boston. Are you a Celtics fan? If not, that’s fine. If so, I don’t really understand your take at all.@SamBergerShow @StinkyEarl @DanKelley66 @TheCelticsWire @celtics They could, they probably won’t, but they could. The NBA is a huge mess this year who knows. I don’t find it odd at all. Team could run it all the way to the ECF, the team could also lose first round to Milwaukee. I just don’t find it a crime for a Celtics fan to be optimistic@Bobby_Bogart @TheCelticsWire @celtics Can’t.@isaiahthomas @TaylorSportsGrp @celtics sign this man please!@SamBergerShow @TheCelticsWire @celtics They’ve been to 3 of the past 5 ECF. That’s not average.@CoreyB08 @DanKelley66 @TheCelticsWire @celtics Theis is better than Richardson or Schroeder? I mean you’re proving my point. The team can do no wrong according to people like you. That’s a ridiculous take.@Andrewkendo @StinkyEarl @DanKelley66 @TheCelticsWire @celtics I don’t have “an issue” with them wanting their team to win. IM a Celtics fan. I want them to win. But I’m realistic. This guys talking about how they are going to be the one seed. Like really? That’s reality?? Green teamers think they can do no wrong. Common man. You know this.@isaiahthomas still waiting to read you will be joining the @celtics!@ACuneo3577 @MichaelMedeiro4 @TheCelticsWire @celtics I love you for “Believing in your team”. But ask yourself this. Do Detroit lions fans, believe in their team, or do they just want them to win?@SamBergerShow @DanKelley66 @TheCelticsWire @celtics Ime was literally using an 8 man rotation. Langford and Nesmith weren’t even seeing minutes they have two better bench players than they did before the deadline with the option to add veteran depth with playoff experience in buy out market go be 9/10th man depth@DanKelley66 @TheCelticsWire @celtics The team has SIX players. 6 after the deadline. Nice depth. One guy gets hurt, they are done. Please.  Stop with the “Brad shortened his bench now thank god stuff”. Oh yes! Less players who can play! That’s good, right?! People please use your heads. I beg you.Born 2/12 TheBillRussell @RealBillRussell former pro basketball player who played as a center for the #BostonCeltics of the  (#NBA) from 1956 to 1969. A five-time NBA Most Valuable Player and a 12-time All-Star, he was the centerpiece of the Celtics dynasty https://t.co/n9fsArZKjw@DanKelley66 @TheCelticsWire @celtics My realistic explanation? The Celtics are an average team and have been for years. You think they will be “at the top of the conference “ soon. Oh yeah? Cool. Hit me up in 2 months when they lose in the first or second round AGAIN.  😂@SamBergerShow @StinkyEarl @DanKelley66 @TheCelticsWire @celtics I don’t think there’s anything wrong with fans being optimistic about their teams. That’s what makes them fans. They want them to win. I just find it odd that Boston Sports Media have an issue with fans rooting for their teams to do well. Just comes off as contrived hot takes.@Andrewkendo @StinkyEarl @DanKelley66 @TheCelticsWire @celtics Why am I a dick because I don’t say everything the Celtics do is puppy dogs and ice creams like you poor lost souls?

The Greatest Champion of Them All.@Marc_DAmico @celtics Smart is the only lock. Rob should probably make it but only 2 centers make it and he's got stiff competition from Gobert &amp; Embiid.

We got 2 spots left right?@celtics Love how Tatum, Brown, and Timelord all pump their fists when it drops (and Smart presses the ref, as per usual).@Marc_DAmico @celtics Rob might be this teams best defender but the path to all defense for a big is tough for the next few years.
