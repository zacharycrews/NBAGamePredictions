📊 @betwayusa https://t.co/CetGBT1Ayp@NBA2K @Bucks @celtics Tatum should have a higher layup, ball handling and perimeter D. Giannis shouldn’t have a higher ball handling than Tatum@LEDBreezey @TyphoonPapii @NBA2K @Bucks @celtics Yeah plus giannis can still move up and down the floor with the ball at times, he’s still a bit flexible for a 7 footer. But I won’t be mad at that what I’m actually mad at is them giving Giannis a 77 Pass vision! That’s ridiculously stupid cos Giannis is a beautiful passer.@OfficialNBARefs @celtics @Bucks @NBAonTNT The real stars of the show 🔥🔥"They're not coming back from a 3-1 deficit against Giannis and the Milwaukee Bucks, that is not happening.They have to even the series tonight."

The issue is that if you don't, teams will move. Thus, if they voted no, Milwaukee would have most likely lost out on the Bucks franchise and the Fiserv in general. 

It's an unfortunate, complex issue@ehis_jr @TyphoonPapii @NBA2K @Bucks @celtics I'm not too pressed on Tatum's ball handling rating, I'm more so speaking on the fact that Giannis' rating for ball handling is way  too high. The only thing I can think of to justify it is that ball handling also determines steal success rate and Giannis dont get stripped often@Bucks Please winn pleasee@NBA2K @Bucks @celtics and this is why i dont and wont play this game anymore😂@steveniscool125 @xado124 @GuessWhoNot_DJT @ajbennett23 @NBA2K @Bucks @celtics That’s not what he’s saying at all he’s saying when he brings the ball up it gets stripped less what your talking about is passing a ball and it going out of bounds. Giannas rarely gets stripped because he has really good fundamentals just not crafty moves.Game 4 of the #Celtics vs. #Bucks #NBAPlayoffs series is Monday night in Milwaukee. #FearTheDeer #BleedGreen

For starters, Giannis is rarely doing anything fancy in terms of dribbling to have an 87, need to bring back security rating, 2nd it's Chris Paul for crying out loud@bleedgreenbnr18 @IsoGodCisco @Nobodyaskedxd @NBA @Bucks @celtics You mean when he was flopping from “taking charges” if you’re just going to stand there and now play defense your probably going to get hurt@steveniscool125 @GuessWhoNot_DJT @ajbennett23 @NBA2K @Bucks @celtics Giannis clears Tatum Srry@coreyreilly00 @celtics @Bucks @NBAonTNT @985TheSportsHub @jaytatum0 Giannis doesn’t need a jump shot@celtics @Bucks @NBAonTNT @985TheSportsHub Good luck.  If the @NBA starts providing proper officiating I might watch again at some point in the future.@C1ampy @NBA2K @Bucks @celtics "Ball control" has less to do with how crafty your handle is, and more to do with how knowledgeable you are in terms of where to have the ball when it's in your hands.@NBA @Bucks @warriors @celtics @memgrizz MNF in May@GuessWhoNot_DJT @ajbennett23 @NBA2K @Bucks @celtics but... we were talking about ball handle... and now you're arguing the complete opposite of what i was saying... i'm so confused 😭@NBA2K @Bucks @celtics Why is this even a question. https://t.co/jatLkpYKLQ@celtics @Bucks @NBAonTNT @985TheSportsHub be afraid boston. but have a fun time and let’s hope for no injuries on both sides 🙏 https://t.co/EckAoV0Rck@steveniscool125 @ajbennett23 @NBA2K @Bucks @celtics "Having good control of the ball" has nothing to do with how creative your handle is. That sh*t doesn't make you much better of a basketball player. It's about how effective you are with the ball in your hands. How smart are you with where to put the ball against your opponent.@celtics @Bucks @NBAonTNT @985TheSportsHub Can’t wait. High energy coast to coast for 48 minutes. Back to Boston series knotted at 2-2.@AKUMP0_SZN @Pathto18 @celtics @Bucks @NBAonTNT @985TheSportsHub arguably my favorite meme format@celtics @Bucks @NBAonTNT @985TheSportsHub Giannis postgame interview he implied yall beg for and expect calls… “if you about that then you about that” 😂😂

@jaytatum0 @FCHWPO this is WAR 😂@IsoGodCisco @Nobodyaskedxd @Spacylw @NBA @Bucks @celtics Couldve sworn that Smart had to sit out a game because he literally got injured from Giannis drives...@NBA2K @Bucks @celtics I’m sure Giannis has better ball handling ability than Tatum 2k@natevomhof @melaniebricks @onmilwaukee @visitmilwaukee @Bucks @DeerDistrict @DeerDistrictVIP @MilwDowntown @FiservForum @BucksBango @NBAonTNT Great pix. I can feel the nervous energy. 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥@JakeCrain_ @CrainCompany @Blain_Crain @Baby_Cone_ @davidadamcone @ReplacementCone @Craincopicks @PodSTBullies @LA_RAMblingBear @CollegeFix Bucks -1 (-105) #boosterclub. 4-2 on the month. Just going to keep betting Milwaukee when I can in the hopes it helps Boston win the series@SmartsRobe36 @celtics @Bucks @NBAonTNT @985TheSportsHub I agree with you. It's what you do when you're down that defines you. As Barkley said: Anyone can hit a shot when you're up or tied in a game. Making a last second shot when your down by one or more points is something else. MJ could do it. Need JT to do the same.NBA BASKETBALL IS TONIGHT! #NBAPlayoffs #NBA75

U been doing it a lot but just trust the process and the team https://t.co/5sNWvqREyi@GuessWhoNot_DJT @ajbennett23 @NBA2K @Bucks @celtics mans is pressed bc he doesn't know what ball handle is lol@CBS58 @Bucks @Giannis_An34 @Flight23White this life size right?@BitterCeltsFan @AKUMP0_SZN @celtics @Bucks @NBAonTNT @985TheSportsHub I saw the stat earlier. Celtics being down 2-1 is different@NBA2K @Bucks @celtics It's actually pretty funny how people are failing to realize that "ball control" has less to do with how crafty your handles are, but rather how efficient you are at creating a bucket when the ball is in your hands.@BeanTownMenace0 @CBS58 @mordecai381 @Bucks @Giannis_An34 Imagine being such a 🤡 that you take time out of your day to comment on post from a news station 1000 miles away.@C1ampy @NBA2K @Bucks @celtics That one's more difficult to measure because Dame averages a lot of assists. But I can see it.@WisemanFan @NBA2K @Bucks @celtics U lost ur mind, Wiggins a chris bosh lvl player gianiss n Tatum legit 1s@NBA2K @Bucks @celtics Cmon now. Giannis all day. And I'm not even a Bucks fans, it's just... Giannis is OP IRL.@celtics @Bucks @NBAonTNT @985TheSportsHub @jaytatum0 Feel free to show up early to figure out your jumpshot@KiraAnkari @NBA2K @Bucks @celtics If you can create more field goals than your opponent on the same number of turnovers, you have a better handle of the ball. Doesn't matter how crafty it looks, it just has to be efficient.@ItzWildyy @NBA2K @Bucks @celtics yea true but still AKUMPO be playing like a guard sometimes and he averageing 6 assist but i think tatum has a better ball handle@KendrickPerkins and others still want to keep that same ENERGY going against @Bucks 
#keeponhating@NBA2K @Bucks @celtics Tatum got locked up by a 70 overall Wes matthews@steveniscool125 @ajbennett23 @NBA2K @Bucks @celtics Yes it does. It has EVERYTHING to do with dribbling. If you can create more field goals on the same number of turnovers compared to another player, your ball control is better.NBA action:

4. Boston Celtics (103.7)
5. Dallas Mavericks (103.9)@NBA2K @Bucks @celtics To those who are asking why Giannis' ball control rating is higher than Tatum's, it's because he averages more points (+3) and assists (+1.5) on just a slightly higher turnover average (+0.4).

Despite the return of DPOY Smart + a last-second Horford tip-in, a fast-finishing Boston squad just couldn't get it done. 
Boston is 7-2 ATS following a loss &amp; 8-1-1 ATS in their last 10 against Milwaukee. The line is +1, so we're taking H2H.

How much y'all pay off the refs for that game?We’re hoping the Celtics get past Giannis Antetokounmpo and the Milwaukee Bucks. A year where the Celtics have been scary+good I hope they don’t lose sight of how far they’ve come since January. Either way, we’ll watch and not get in the players’ way.

These guys are Sconi through and through  ! https://t.co/83vqxxlOyx@ClaySunUnion @Bucks @PicknSaveStores I believe the goaltending, mugging Tatum at the rim with an elbow to his face, running over Grant punching Rob in the face and the 5 missed calls in the last 2 minutes the refs admitted missing but oh my God we went to the line more. ..Milwaukee Bucks: Bucks-Celtics Game 3 Last Two Minute report: NBA weights in on Jrue Holiday's foul on Marcus Smart, other deciding https://t.co/2MLJqTSq7X@rob84443992 @JasonDRobins @Bucks @celtics Every growth stock has been killed. Your own fault investing at all time highs after the greatest bull mkt in historyWho's everyone betting on game 4 Boston Celtics vs Milwaukee Bucks?

#nbabets@ASherrodblakely @FCHWPO @celtics @Bucks Jaylen is in the right mindset coz the result can't change. Problem is officials shouldnt encourage flopping. Plus maintaining that Smart was not in the act of shooting, conflicts with fan and media perspectives. Bad officiating is no different than a player having a bad game.@sportsgram57 @Bucks @PicknSaveStores By that standard, Boston wouldn’t have had Horford, both Williams’, Tatum, Brown or Smart. If the officials call the same both ways, Boston doesn’t hold Milwaukee to 103 points, and the game would have been a Milwaukee blowout. So yeah…@LikeSpend1 @TupacAG Current NBA Champion Milwaukee Bucks feature a Twin Towers lineup too. 😀😀😀 7'0 Center Brook Lopez and 6'11 Power Forward Giannis Antetokuompo. Use "Drop Zone Defense" to keep Lopez glued to the Rim. Dare you to make enough 3-pointers.@noonesburner1 @Wesly___ @secraw2 @filoASRpain @AnnaHorford @Bucks @PicknSaveStores Lol 😂 that’s what matters idiot we played like shit and we still only lost by 2@SaIMaione @Wesly___ @secraw2 @filoASRpain @AnnaHorford @Bucks @PicknSaveStores There is more than 3 minutes in a game 🤡@Bucks @PicknSaveStores Goaltending.@Bucks @PicknSaveStores Nice Goaltend@ClaySunUnion @Bucks @PicknSaveStores So sick of this dumb fn notion that because we had more free throws we were favored its about all the fn calls that should have been called that weren't....Giannis should have fouled out by the end of the third quarter if the game was called correctly so many calls missed.@Bucks @PicknSaveStores It's an obvious goaltend. Embarrassing for the officials and the Bucks fans who try to deflect and defend the HORRIBLE officiating that allows Giannis to consistently initiate contact by launching his body into defenders who are in front of him in proper defensive position..@raf_tyler is a BEAST.... will not be looking forward to facing  him in the semi's
Provided both the @Bucks and @MiamiHEAT face off@LegsESPN @smart_MS3 @Bucks The problem with this argument is the focus on 'think'.

It doesn't matter what Smart thought (imo, he didn't immediately think of 3, only after the other option was not there), all that matters is what happened. And what happened is very clearly described in the review.@Bucks @PicknSaveStores This is pretty good angle of the ball on its way down !! Idk bout you , but if this was @rob_williamsIII he would be called for goaltending?? 🤷‍♂️@wnbajones @ArtButSports @Giannis_An34 @Bucks @brewhoop @ErnieBarnesArt Good times@bhillsmusic @dcwriter360 @DiIorioAndrew @Bucks @PicknSaveStores @jaytatum0 Celtics defenders act like Italian soccer players.@sportsgram57 @Bucks @PicknSaveStores If you think that the officiating was favoring Milwaukee, you’re in another f’n universe. Was it the 34-17 Boston FT advantage? The 17-0 advantagein the last 15+ min? The inconsistency between the no-calls and the Boston parade to the FT line? What exactly favored Milwaukee? https://t.co/wjRMuB0S8J@noonesburner1 @Wesly___ @secraw2 @filoASRpain @AnnaHorford @Bucks @PicknSaveStores Do me a favor and look at the last two minute report for game 3 maybe you’ll understand how the refs handed you that game@nickbicycle @Jman8883 @ChrisBurak @Bucks @PicknSaveStores Dude, I tried arguing with you as nicely as I can.  Peace out.@riordan_jody @MODA3 @Bucks No shot@Bucks less turnovers &amp; stay aggressive going to the rim get those bugs in foul trouble &amp; make smart plays defensively a guaranteed win next game also defend everything don’t let them just shoot the shots without at least closing out strong &amp; under controlled to give pressure.@SaIMaione @Wesly___ @noonesburner1 @secraw2 @filoASRpain @AnnaHorford @Bucks @PicknSaveStores Sounds like an entire fanbase is living rent free right now.

These Celtics fans are mad salty right now 😂@ArtButSports @Giannis_An34 @Bucks @brewhoop @ErnieBarnesArt Aint we lucky we got 'em.'@NSheth4 @Jman8883 @ChrisBurak @Bucks @PicknSaveStores Learn how to play without fouling maybe. It was pretty amazing that they actually called the Bucks for some of their fouls for a quarter.“Some calls didn’t go our way. Obviously, we’re upset about that. But it’s over now; move on.” - @FCHWPO   who has the right mindset heading into what the @celtics  should view as a must-win Game 4 against the @Bucks on Monday. ​

And if we’re pussies and we’re playing “too physical” as pussies then what are the Celtics.@NOT_Hollywood7 @horchata999 @AnnaHorford @Bucks @PicknSaveStores Except in real time and in this replay you could tell it was on it's way down. Basketballs don't float in a straight line. I don't know what kind of physics classes you all took in high-school, but you must have failed. Maybe just because you need glasses.

Jaylen and Jayson push off sometimes. Giannis pushes off, charges and straight up fouls all the time and doesn't get called either, but does it literally every play because he can't score outside of the paint.@TripodReynolds @Bucks @Jockey It’s not that deep man@Bucks @BPortistime @pconnaughton I wished someone jumped that high on the last play on Saturday.@TripodReynolds @IowaHoopsDave @Bucks @Jockey Don’t be that guy…@TripodReynolds @IowaHoopsDave @Bucks @Jockey so what you are saying is that it's about yourself and the money not the team.
