Heard it was this guys B-day . 

We dont celebrate B-day with a loss. 

Stephen Curry of the Golden State Warriors will score over 25.5 points

Lets pick up a quick 50$ on this@warriors happy b-day Curry 🐐🐐KD chose Golden State because he thought their system “complimented” his game. The Warriors had two outside flame throwers in Curry and Thompson leaving the middle wide open him. Not because he wanted to get away from Russ.
