Need to match the athleticism of other teams sometimes. Looney couldn’t keep up. Kuminga def brings a different dimension to any lineup.@warriors Sans the one he missed where he was wide open smh@michaelsobolik @warriors @chamath Maybe the Uyghurs should stop sending terrorists to help the Taliban and ISIS and stop terrorist attacks inside China@DatFlipLife @Warriorsnin3rs @warriors @Garydwayne Kuminga is a better scorer than D.Lee.

Need to step it up.@DogSurfRoadshow @WheresTheBall97 @Warriors24Pod @Rick24Barry @warriors Here we go. "Lacob's burner account" every time someone agrees with the moves the FO made or didn't make.

No Klay to disrupt Wiggins and Poole, huge blowout
The problem is Wiggins + Poole playing with Klay
They will figure it out eventually but it has little to do with GreenKlay Thompson was definitely trying too hard in last night's game.
He just needs to take his time and sort himself back into the groove.
Since he's been back he's messed Wiggins and Poole's rhythm

Two totally different things man. Wiggins was more about the salary, which wasn't Warriors fault.

The bigger issue is your entire thread focusing on the Warriors not using MLE. Like, why must they? They got a MLE-level player like Otto on a VetMin.@Harlem4Dais @Brookwood408 @Jagdev77 @anthonyVslater @warriors No man he played on the Magic Johnson Lakers@mcgboye @WheresTheBall97 @Warriors24Pod @Rick24Barry @warriors When he plays he’s still efficient and the only way you could prove it’s a bad move is if the @warriors sign him and he doesn’t contribute. I remember when people were criticizing me for wanting Wiggins but continue on.@bill95032 @warriors That doesn’t mean too many 3 point shots that just means too many misses. They got plenty of good looks but they were missing.@DogSurfRoadshow @WheresTheBall97 @Warriors24Pod @Rick24Barry @warriors He was past it last year, which is why Denver didn't aggressively try to retain him. He's been playing like a player past it this year. And now the Nets are moving him on in favor of a two-way player, and rightly so. He'll be 37 next month and we could have wasted the MLE.@warriors @Oracle How about he dose this in 4th quarter?@michaelsobolik @warriors @chamath Sure! https://t.co/gpIBekWh5I@kirkgoldsberry @Suns @memgrizz @dmorey @MiamiHEAT @dallasmavs @Lakers @BrooklynNets @celtics @warriors @chicagobulls It's weird how much more strongly defense correlates to Net than offense does.@niner_raccoon @SFGarrett @jayvo1k_ @anthonyVslater @warriors Basketball is such a great sport because any team has a chance to win on any night

The team is lack heart or fire in DEFENSE. Wiggins 38 mins 11 points. You finally start Kuminga but only give him 15 mins. You bring in Looney which causes F foul and turnover.

Damn@thegenreisbtss @warriors and stop playing jta on crunch time@warriors @KlayThompson @StephenCurry30 Duarte 27 Pont 🔥🔥🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️🇩🇴🇩🇴🇩🇴🇩🇴🇩🇴@LookatChefCurry @warriors Kerr coaches these guys like a rec ball coach. Unfortunate. A lot of bad choices with this string of losses!@sagesteele @Pacers @warriors That was probably the best game I’ve seen the Pacers play this season and they didn’t have one starter on the court. From the Pacers to the Hoosiers… One hell of a night to be a Indiana sports fan ☝🏼@warriors It proves 3 things: 1. kerr is really just a bad coach. 5 secs with 3 pt lead. They should have foul. 2. Curry not a thinking player. Poor defense 3. Klay and Wigs are role players and very inconsistent@warriors Don’t ever disrespect the word clutch cause he most definitely isn’t clutch@warriors Lost to a g-league Pacer’s team without Turner, Sabonis. Levers, Brogdon lmfao 😂😂🤣. In all seriousness I hope Craig is alright.@TheMisterMann @anthonyVslater @warriors oops@ScharffReece69 @LulTreyy5 @BillyClosset @warriors That make the warriors just look even worse bro..What is that record for the last 12 games?@anthonyVslater @warriors Lookin pretty stupid now@Jacob54875305 @warriors Lost to pacers without no caris brogdon and sabonis cry@feels_tee @warriors I missed it WTF HAPPENED??@warriors Wiggins a walking Brick 🧱. Klay also@lorenzoy12 @warriors And he chose not to foul up three, at least he finally let steph play for more than 5 minutes at a time but overall a terrible night for kerr as a coach, he should just let draymond make the subs and plays even if he's playing@warriors Should have at least played GP II and Klay in OT... 😏@CacaReborn @LVD_1088 @GodlLotus @warriors Lmao@JPLynnKing @nbaman19_ @bronbetta23 @warriors My point exactly@warriors Clutch Steph the Goat@TheCaliDude213 @warriors Steph had 3 chances to hit a shot down the stretchGolden State Warriors' Klay Thompson (11) shoots and makes a basket over Indiana Pacers' Keifer Sykes (28) in the fourth quarter of their NBA game at Chase Center in San Francisco, Calif., on Thursday, Jan. 20, 2022. #dubnation #warriorsground #warriors #klaythompson https://t.co/ROLkO9MWlm@Johnsoliz9 @warriors @SteveKerr Lmao https://t.co/gKguR2prZa@LookatChefCurry @warriors For the sake of reality, let us say that Kerr intended him to be in that last possession of the 4th quarter.

He could just simply attack the rim (dunk) instead of just laying it up on the basket. #NBA #DubNation@TerronBackup @warriors U are welcome to check the play by play https://t.co/VPFUTIyaZJ@nbaman19_ @chival_ry @MasterytTix @bronbetta23 @warriors I know I’m talking about him to magic still number 1 until curry gets those accolades@JayLGK @warriors once again prove you missing brain 🤣@warriors Just wait till Klay gets back 🤡🤡🤡🤡@warriors We need KD.@warriors Refs vs Warriors@warriors Tough loss but yeah

The Indiana Pacers defeated the Golden State Warriors in overtime 121-117. #dubnation #warriors https://t.co/UFqk8hTG1p@warriors So I guess the best strategy for teams to beat the Dubs in the play offs is to kneecap Dray... Can Bob Myers get even a $2 centre already???@SeeSawRrr @StephenCurry30 I love the @warriors but they aint winning the championship this year. I think @KlayThompson is done. Youre right, @StephenCurry30 is not clutch. He can shoot but not the Greatest Shooter of all time. He never gets hot like this rookie guy Duarte from @PacersSmh @warriors . U need to stop losing now. Figure this out!@warriors how you guys lose to such Pacers？？？@warriors how are you guys even loose a game ?

- Draymond really can’t score but is the DPOY 
- Wiggins is a top 5 2-Way Player
- True
- GP2 is the best out of the 4 so far since Klay
- Man, they are the 2nd seed in the West 😭@anthonyVslater @warriors And tonight’s game shows what happens when you are not locked in@WisemanFan @warriors I've told by Sabonis Pacers have Kerr naked photograph so he give free win to Pacers 🧐🧐🧐@RachadAkobi @warriors Yesss! Preach!@warriors warriors y’all got laughed by pacer’s starting lineup@shxbus @warriors Are you from the uk?@Con_Chron @StephenCurry30 needs to play his PG role like @CP3 does till @Money23Green doesn’t get back that’s all I’m gonna say and take the ball to the rim than just shooting 3s @warriors depend on 3s only they really don’t know how to score in the paint@CalloutsLFGM @warriors he was like 11-20 at that point in the clip@warriors Everyone drag down Stephen.@MukanzaShamirah @warriors We still have a better record than you@rahul_stuff @warriors They ARE the best they are pretty much in a bad slump right now.

He does not have the desire to take charge. If he only he has the guts of Klay, he will be better@warriors I repeat Steve Kerr built his legacy off of a team that would of still won the 1st set of rings with Mark Jackson coaching.. 2nd set of rings the team could of won those with Luke Walton!

https://t.co/P1ln0ovPLLAll lives matter offense will be the end of this team in the second round. Get your shit together @warriors @SteveKerr@Warriors shot 9/42 from beyond the arc and only lost by 4 pts in OT. Crazy.@WisemanFan @warriors Actually the real culprit of this are Poole and Toscano-Anderson. If you closely look at their shot selection in this game, it is very arguable that these are not the type of results that they get from their shot in the previous games. #NBA #DubNation@warriors wtff I lost my parlay thanks to youTill @warriors newer players don’t figure out how to pass the ball to @StephenCurry30 &amp; @KlayThompson when they are on the floor together - every win = sheer luck and/or other team sucked!@Bnsaki97 @chival_ry @MasterytTix @bronbetta23 @warriors I'm talking about Curry. Curry is the best point guard ever. I was trolling about westbrook@omar74416608 @warriors take ur LIndiana #Pacers upset the Golden State #Warriors 121-117 OT for their second straight road win.

kuminga was consistently getting to the line and GP2 kept getting us the morale we needed

overall just bad@warriors Badly coached game@GordoBlack29 @daniok7_ @lancem69 @therealselena23 @warriors Keep sucking Currys dick bro + 6 followers 😹😹😹@RadRivas Indiana Pacers beat the Golden State Warriors &amp; Lakers in back-to-back wins. Westbrook redeemed@GavinCurrin @BillyClosset @warriors But pacers actually played their starters🤣@Stavi11 @warriors That was painful. 21 turnovers. Ball in their possession with 6 secs left. And lost the ball. PainfulMost Annoying loss so far

C’mon @warriors@warriors We had a 3pt lead with 9 secs to play.  Took them 4 secs to tie it. WTF?! What happened to our top ranked defense??@warriors Get Right Fellas We Ain’t Too Far From Where We Need To Be..Well at least I don't feel so bad the @Lakers losing to the @Pacers ... They beat the @warriors too! #LakeShow 💜💛@warriors @KlayThompson @StephenCurry30 Not enough to beat the pacers@warriors when kevon has the second highest score in this team, we know that this team is trash today@warriors The player that Steph guards are the ones most likey to score since Steph is so far away from them and they are getting uncontested shots.@warriors feels like 2020 all over again@chival_ry @MasterytTix @Bnsaki97 @bronbetta23 @warriors W he's the best point guard of all time@Pattyca26892879 @warriors Ratio@warriors I'm a warriror fan. Delete this please.One thing i always say. The world is a much better place when Golden State Warriors lose.@warriors #SteveKerr being out-coached again, nothing new, last possession few seconds left to play up by 3 and decided not to foul, good job #kerr@iWesliee @Ali_Szn14 @warriors I get that but as a coach you’re running plays to let players shoot from deep when the team has been struggling. Those 33 shots could’ve been easy 2s driving to the paint@warriors Need this as a frame@warriors This is an embarrassing loss.
Only Steph came to play tonight; with the exception of Klay others suck 😒 😤. 

What's wrong with JP? If he can't adjust to coming off the bench, stop playing him.

Loss to non-starters on b2b game....embarrassing 🤦🏾🤦🏾🤦🏾@warriors Beli deserves more minutes this game… he was super effective@warriors Now delete this@warriors And just when I thought the Sharks losing to the Seattle Kraken was bad@raiderman94 @warriors How can you always be the first one in the thread?@djzee_couture @warriors You lost.@warriors Jordan has to start being accretive with the second unit. Drive &amp; create or get to the line. He's become way too passive now that Klay is back.@warriors That was some trash, embarrassing basketball. Haven't been the same since before Curry broke the record.@warriors Another lose due to poor coaching. How are we not gonna foul when up 3 in the 4th with seconds left. Kerr really f’d up yet again@warriors Bruh the only word I can think of to describe the warriors lately is "WEAK" they look weak their literally goin through the motions getting by, by the skin of their teeth hence why when people talk about "super stars" of the NBA nobody on the warriors is mentioned@missionarymelo @warriors Kuminga stopped playing at 15 mins? Did he get hurt or Kerr just didn’t play him, I didn’t watch the game@warriors Too many 3-point shots! Other than Curry the rest of the team was 3-22 for 3-point shots!@warriors jp getting worst man@LeTrashFraud @KingCheez_5 @Reamdream18 @NBA @warriors u didnt own shit u dug to the depths of hell for a helicopter joke u fr fr sad@MukanzaShamirah @warriors And I'm sad 😭😭😭@BullsFan2021_ @warriors You missing brain?@warriors 3 player slightly in 3 digits@GavinCurrin @BillyClosset @warriors Bro what makes you think I’m a laker fan holy shit@warriors you guys are extremely toxic for me@anthonyVslater @warriors And then proceeded to lose to a depleted pacers team@Laks1Govind @Brad_Russ3 @warriors There’s no “playing terrible” for the lakers they just suck in general.@GavinCurrin @HonestPacersFan @BillyClosset @warriors Don’t matter though yall lost to the pacers bench 😂😂@nbaman19_ @MasterytTix @Bnsaki97 @bronbetta23 @warriors Oh but he did crossed Gobert and an easy lay-up.@warriors Why Lee in the game but not Poole or GP2?  Fire Kerr!! @Warriors, @WarriorsPR, @957thegame@redflash266 @morky23 @warriors It’s ridiculous that he let 33 shots fly when the team has been ass from 3@nbaman19_ @lancem69 @Bnsaki97 @bronbetta23 @warriors Well, that sucks. Rip.@warriors Evryone must go to detention and run 100 suicides tomorrow….oh wait we have another game …nvm@ChesterQ1984 @warriors Yeah. True. Thanks. I feel better already.How about those @pacers ! Went to San Fran &amp; beat the @warriors in OT despite Indiana missing ALL of their starters.  Lineup was full of names you prob don't know, including Keifer Sykes, whose journey to the NBA has been incredible. ⬇️ https://t.co/08FXagDM5jTalo yung mga manok ko today ☹️ but that’s ok. 🙂 Tomorrow is another day. Let’s bounce back @SB19Official and @warriors 💪@warriors Ayeee we out here playing relays again huuuf we are down deep we should try to bounce big...this slump is real!!! We need to shrug off and wake up big time@warriors Don't care just want Kerr to stop using the excuse "it's a bad night".
Actually analysis what went wrong or 
make better lineups that minimize each player's weaknesses.@BigBoss52112110 @RealGregMoore @WinPlsdamn @warriors He played good at clutch at 4th but still kerr should have put GP2 instead.

Plua, that FG% hovering around 63!  Is it just me, or is that pretty dang good for an SG?  And with close to 17 MPG, sample size isn't all that small.Ticket prices spike for marquee Chicago Bulls vs. Golden State Warriors game

In response, Steve “Dumbass” Kerr plays him the entire OT over GPII and Looney@ralphiebohner @warriors They’ve been average since before the injury to Draymond (back stuff doesn’t usually just go away either) and before Klay came I believe they were like 7-5 their last 12 so if title is still the goal I’d be a little concerned@warriors Go if fuck.@nbaman19_ @Bnsaki97 @bronbetta23 @warriors I don't see russ getting a ring@warriors Worst loss of the season, and it’s not even close.@patsmakemesad @rahul_stuff @warriors what the@WisemanFan @warriors Everyone@JabbarsBurner @warriors As far as I know, the Warriors are 1-0 in their season series against the @Lakers this season.

And the Pacers crushed the Lakers even if LeBron James scored 30+ points.@warriors This one stings. Bad loss. Bad shooting night… again! I am starting to get concerned about the @Warriors shooting and lack of offensive diversity. This right now looks like a “bounce out of the 1st rd” team. #DubNation #NBAonTNT@warriors that was a tough loss@GSWReign @warriors SHOOTING 12% FROM DISTANCE WITHOUT CURRY?? HOW THIS TEAM MOVING BACKWARDS? I MAD!@1Honor_Jose @Ali_Szn14 @warriors i agree but we can’t just blame our losses on the coach everytime. team effort, he played a role in this loss by not having the right rotations in, especially in the 4th but players have got to make their shots yo, cant go 9-42 and expecting to win a ball gameKeep this up and you bitches will be #3 seed by the time Draymond comes back @warriors@bronbetta23 @warriors How about trading westbrick for curry😆😆😆@warriors Was at the game frustrating to watch curry needed help no one was shooting goodTouch loss for the @warriors …You can’t win a game when you go 9/42 on threes and 21 turnovers.🥴 Nonetheless, that was still a very entertaining game.😌👌🏽@YC_0015 @warriors u lost bud@GavinCurrin @BillyClosset @warriors LeVert had a 22 point 4th quarter you casual@warriors Don’t https://t.co/SFKhgILZIY@bronbetta23 @warriors How is JorGod better than LeBeautiful?
Recruiting players - LeBeautiful
All - JorGod@WadeDrop @BillyClosset @warriors And lakers still suck@warriors Without Draymond the Warriors are undisciplined. This is a totally different team now and Klay need to take better shots or pass the ball. Jordan doesn't like coming of the bench. He's hesitating too much. He needs to shoot 3's  Klay isn't going to be ready this year.@uhlone__ @warriors Wat we don’t suck it’s just when curry not on the whole team is off same thing with lebron when he’s off the Lakers suck 🤷🏽‍♂️@warriors Wack as game@warriors Lot of games left but this one was embarrassing.  Kerr is so overrated@warriors let this be a lesson play your rookie let him develop he could have had great quality mins tonight. He even played great in the first half before benching him. Pacers rookie had 25 and a dub #Noted 📝@Original_Turner Come to @warriors .. yes I’m shamelessGo if fuck @warriors https://t.co/qgBgp31qmE@uhlone__ @warriors Happen when we have no bigs nor defense plus no green all we got is looney@warriors Tell him to go get the ball in OT. Looked like he didn’t want it. My favorite player to watch in the league, but played very passive when it mattered. GO GET THE BALL!@warriors Hm: Wiggins and Andre@warriors Lol ok@warriors Trade wiggins@warriors Don't careThanks, @warriors  😡😡😡😡😡😡@warriors Why everyone losing to the pacers lately lol@warriors Jordan 25 minutes and 5 points........@therealselena23 @warriors Bro u lack "Curry isn't clutch"@warriors And still found a way to lose@uhlone__ @warriors these the warriors fan that people make fun of🤣@JayLGK @warriors Ratio + #StephenCurry #NBAALLSTAR@ZayCinema @BMACK_3 @warriors In 44 minutes..@warriors Who sold@ArnavBhargava1 @warriors When the warriors lose, The niners win.@Plazuhbtw @warriors Still had 39?@warriors Klay why? https://t.co/g1qPKCynxwThe Fort Wayne Mad Ants beat the Golden State Warriors by 4 https://t.co/1XMHh08o6T@Aceless0512 @therealselena23 @warriors Lol nope not even close.

All of them didn’t play tonight 🤣🤡@warriors Fired kerr@warriors We really need Draymond back@warriors When do you guys plan on getting your shit together. Win one, lose one, cover the spread one night, get handed your ass the next. No consistency.@ScharffReece69 @Blazersplzwin @warriors nothing in OT bum@warriors All the Warriors haters are out right now and i dont blame them. I dont care if a team is depleted, haunted or handicapped. You're not winning a basketball game with 21 turnovers!! Pacers are feeling like rockstars. Beat Lakers and now Warriors.

Shooting - curry, (pretty close tho)
rebounding - Russ
Playmaking - Russ
Defense - Russ
Finishing - Russ
Blowing finals leads - Curry
Needs superteams - Curry
Detriment to his team - Curry@bronbetta23 @warriors Lebrons gonna be a first round exit@warriors This team needs Draymond@warriors Worst loss ever!  WTF is Kerr thinking?@warriors Kerr literally robbing Kuminga of developing@warriors Y’all really lost to our bench warmers 😂 https://t.co/ZL8040GE04@Plazuhbtw @warriors Ratio@ScottAgness This was the ultimate Trap Game for the @warriors@BagOfWords @warriors Dino, imagine being a Laker fan right now. 😭
😂@warriors @StephenCurry30 @juanonjuan10 @KlayThompson @22wiggins @Garydwayne @SteveKerr Ending my not good day in a not good day :((@warriors Trade curry@warriors What happened with Joku? He started the game nice and took him out. Whyturnovers and JTA attempts the game winner with klay, Wiggins, and curry on the floor 😐 losing against G league players on a back to back @warriors@warriors Steve Kerr not playing Jonathan Kuming in the clutch should be considered as racism. Absolutey 0 reason@warriors I know stop tweeting@warriors That was absolutely pathetic wtf@Warriors y’all really gotta stop f*cking around at practice. No more baseball bats! Y’all should be practicing highly contested layups, floaters, and midrange jumpers. #INDvsGSW@warriors WE NEED GREEN! LOONEY WTF WAS THAT!@warriors Should’ve kept loons in@warriors Disappointing,are we creeping back to last season now😒@warriors I know how it feels https://t.co/M0kCyCViNY@itzcumber @warriors And playing down to the competition@warriors PUT ME ON THE COURT I HIT MORE 3S &gt;:( &gt;:( WTF@warriors klay is washed@warriors No Levert, No Sabonis, No Turner, No Warren and the Warriors still lost, so the Lakers loss to Indiana wasn’t that bad if you compare the two@warriors DepressionYo! The @warriors got caught sleeping! @Pacers great win@TerronBackup @warriors he took 1 shot in OT and had 39 points@warriors Stephen Curry choked against a trash Pacers team without their starters and everybody is fine with it.

But if it was Lebron, Giannis, or Kevin Durant they’d be trending #1 getting slandered.

Once again proves that Steph is the most protected athlete of all time.@BrianAgustin25 @SteveKerr @warriors @NBA That was awful. But you have to give the faul before that shot and that was in Toscano hands 🤦🏻‍♂️ wrong decision right at the end@iWesliee @Ali_Szn14 @warriors This has happened since game 1 with the turnovers. If you can’t coach out the TOs then these losses have few excuses@warriors More like choke.. it's a joke that clay is over booker in the all stars.. he's played 6 games and over 2 year and just lost the game to a bench version of the worst team in league..Final 📊

Stephen - 39p/5r/8a/1s
Kevon - 13p/15r/3a/2s
Klay - 12p/2r/1a

Great day!@theskeetle @warriors Awww still unacceptable that Iggy was in the game we got klay 2 extra minutes won’t hurt him or even kumaniga shi put Lee in someone that can hit a shot cus Iggy not it🤦🏿‍♀️@rahul_stuff @warriors he still lost too so does it really make a difference@warriors Wtf boys, next....@warriors Just pathetic! I ain't giving y'all a pass for this embarrassing performance! All around weak 💩@warriors i don't understand why kerr use jta,andre,but not gp2 or jp🤔🤔🤔🤔@warriors Just lost to this! Seriously?? 😂 https://t.co/rCqlT2XaSW@warriors Anyone with news on Wiseman?@warriors A loss to the Pacers, really? I like Kerr but he lost the plot tonight. He has to figure out this starting line and a better way to work Klay in. We're better than this. #DubNation https://t.co/zdX1EeNBXk@Colinta26135116 @warriors Preach!Wait a minute

Did the Golden State Warriors minus Draymond Green lose to the Indian Pacers BENCH!!!!!????

Congrats to the @Pacers on their tough win!
#NBAonTNT@GodlLotus @warriors your boi missed wide open shot and got swatted on the lay up, he can’t iso to save his life@RealGregMoore @warriors FACTS😞@warriors How is Klay expected to tie it after sitting all OT? Tough loss tonight.@warriors can the warriors depend on players like Looney and Wiggins for the championship??@warriors PWAHAHAHAHAHHAHA!!! Sike nah, that was a good game. Super talented team n coulda gone either way… Glad y’all lost tho lol 🤣🤣💀💀 #gosuns@GavinCurrin @BillyClosset @warriors I mean they lost to a bad Pacers team without Levert, brogdon, turner, McConnell, Sabonis@TheKumBucket00 @jayvo1k_ @anthonyVslater @warriors Well, I guess it does matter because they lost tonight in overtime. Maybe next time they practice basketball instead of playing baseball.@warriors This is me rn and yall come with the "we fought to the end" bs...just stfu https://t.co/79gwxDs2nn@warriors Y’all need to go back and work on ball handling 😤so many turn overs@warriors lmao@JujutsuZype @warriors That's really frustrating, seeing Warriors struggling against depleted Pacers 🤦🤦@warriors @Money23Green 😫😫😫😫
The play maker in the team 💯@CalloutsLFGM @warriors steph froze ❄️❄️@warriors I feel bad for Steph he dropped 39 just to lose@Dverxs @warriors He’s 5 games back from 2 years out you meltI don't know how many times I have to reiterate this but without @Money23Green the @warriors are just a decent but not special NBA team. Like taking Magic or Bird away from the 80s Lakers/Celtics. Tonight's loss against a depleted @IndianaPacers_ team was really disappointing.Great game by the Pacers. Embarrassing loss by the @warriors

A super effort and win tomorrow won't change the sting on this one.@warriors hard to watch the whole game! Bad coaching, should have foul leading by 3.@KardsDTX @Plazuhbtw @warriors He hasn’t done in a month  and he finally dropped 30+ for the first time in a month but he also sold the game . He made a defensive mistake that led to the pacers scoring that 3 in the end of regulation and he also missed all his shots in overtime@marcsardou @warriors The all backboard is a rough miss man, can get middle school kids to finish thatCan saturday come closer, fuck the @warriors .. gimme some Deebo.@Warriorsnin3rs @warriors Just because he his the brother-in-law of steph, they keep him@itzcumber @warriors They looked like the Knicks tonight@warriors Poole.

The team aint the same without ya.@warriors Kerr substitution during the season has cause this low period.@warriors With a 3 point lead in the last seconds you should have fouled on the possession play and let them shoot 2 instead of them taking the game to O.T🤬🤬🤬🤬@warriors Getting beat at home by a sub 500 team that had no starters available. Wow.@warriors team snack before every game https://t.co/Ak3GBhlMfTI cannot believe I stayed up to watch that disgraceful performance @warriors @SteveKerr https://t.co/Q19QiXAUAu@warriors What happened@warriors wtf is going onnnn??!!?? Y’all started this season perfectly and now y’all are slacking. Cmon man! This isn’t Warriors Basketball that I remember watching in the 2010’s!@warriors It’s the same thing game after game, year after year, this team can’t take care of the ball. Hey @warriors maybe instead of showing the warriors shooting 3s, start showing them practicing defense or taking of the ball…@MOBBIN44 @warriors I took pacers on odd 7 and 4.5 quickest 300 i made@warriors Let's go San Jose Giants!!! They just can't shoot, pass, make switch on D, and the confidence level is below zero. It's OK!! https://t.co/8JQEjiDj19i could have been asleep right now thanks a fucking lot @warriors@warriors are y’all dead ass dawg!!?!?

That is impressive.@JujutsuZype @warriors In my head I’m like oh he’s a professional, he got this…. 🤦🏽‍♂️ Not only was it a miss, but whew@warriors tell Steph that he ain't Dame LillardHow y’all let @Pacers beat y’all without their starters? @warriors@warriors Hmm didn’t really feel like it…@dumberweebcyan @warriors LMAO@YoriichinoKuni @warriors I was so mad when I watched this live lmao@mikenewwin @Pacers @warriors That's on Kerr. We definitely should have fouled and put them on the line instead of allowing them to jack-up a 3-pointer. With 9 seconds left in overtime, Rick Carlyle had no problem directing his team to foul instead of allowing the Dubs to shoot a 3 for the tie. SMH.@akan3chan @warriors @BamBam1A Great song 💚

#StephenCurry #NBAAllStar@warriors I’m really tired of seeing this team think they can just walk into a game against a shit opponent and think they can easily win it. Playing down to people is not a good look 🖕🏻@warriors Duarte owns your poverty franchise https://t.co/xzkSggiDhD@warriors Kerr is to blame. He picked the absolute worst people to play in OT. JTA over GP!? Lee!? He sucks! Poole is so reckless, that was also a horrible choice!@warriors Lol and this is the team the media are obsessing over to win the title.@BiggRannn @Plazuhbtw @warriors Also messed the game . His defensive mistake led to the pacers scoring that 3 in the end of regulation and he missed all his shots in overtimedeserve @warriors 🥴@warriors Draymond HOFer. He's the glue for dynasty. He's gonna get a statue.@warriors Warriors are officially out of it. Losing to Indiana is unconscionable. You can’t be a championship team and lose games like this. I would say they suck, but that’s not strong enough.@warriors It Hurts but got to give credit to the @Pacers. We got to use this as fuel and to learn from our mistakes #DubNation. You always have our Support Guys.Until @warriors  fire Kerr or get a center I can’t watch it@StephenCurry30 @warriors What an embarassing loss!!! 
The way Warriors is playing in the last 10 games, it will be lucky if they landed in 8th place!@warriors terrible loss, everybody was just missing 3'sWay to ruin my day @warriors  🤦🏾‍♂️I only had $12 available today on a late start. I'd say I did well. God loves me
That loss by the Lakers not looking as bad now. Pacers beat Golden State Warriors and Lakers back to back nights https://t.co/Mfs6jp9Lhv@rahul_stuff @warriors And I was told the Nuggets are the “BEST” team in the league and Jokic is “MVP”

No energy in the first half.
Bonehead foul on a 3 at the end of the half.
Missed opportunity to foul the worst freethrow shooter on the team with 8 seconds left up by 3.
Another horrible team night from deep.

Hope this can be turned into a positive.@warriors Kerr is so dumb, every game the warriors are up 3 at the end he doesnt want to foul.

More info: https://t.co/CmSRpfBOJg https://t.co/YNmlEriov6A wake up call @warriors WTF! You’re playing like amateurs. We need to find steady cast if we want to win another 🏆. This loss is fuckin unacceptable. 🤬🤬🤬@theskeetle @warriors He fouled out? Or was it his second?@guccigangharry @warriors Jta was our second best player in clutch apart from the layup and the three@PiratesWSSZN @warriors CD is a amazing player, goga had a good night and skies if playing great ball, backups? Sure but not as bad as people make it out@warriors And White Iverson wasn’t even playing 😤😂😂 https://t.co/WnFm49vqBY@GavinCurrin @BillyClosset @warriors no one outside of laker fans think the lakers are winning a championship and also starters were playing against the lakers@warriors The worst coaching practice ever. You just waste Steph and Klay effort. It's time to bring back Steph previous Rotation this is suck. Steph in and out is suffocating. 😤😤@warriors y’all trash 🗑 lost to some damn G league pacers@feelinliketune @ZayCinema @BMACK_3 @warriors Yeah just like your bulls.@NBA @Pacers @warriors How many 3 point opertunitys do you need😅🤣😂@warriors 0-7 from 3, turns the ball over as soon as he enters OT, Warriors lose to the depleted Pacers at home 🔥 https://t.co/oVOPYEPmlH@warriors This is embarrassing, we literally gave them the W@warriors Don't tell me no shit, Toscano-Anderson had one job and was to dunk the ball at the end of the fourth quarter cause everyone scared of fouling him. I just don't understand, I hope this is stings and stings hard cause this was a too easy game for you guys to lose.@ElCurry30 @warriors Exactly before OT I was like “FOUL YOU DUMBASS” surprisingly it was Jta guarding Jackson like fucking MORON if he would have fouled he would have gotten 1 or 2 shots and we would have won 🤦🏻‍♂️@warriors JTA instead of kuminga
kerr doin shit 4 sureMaybe instead of a fun baseball photo op you should think about practicing @warriors@warriors The simply unbelievable. Defeat for Pacers? They're kidding! Tomorrow defeat for Rockets too? It's just what's missing. What a shame!@ZayCinema @BMACK_3 @warriors Lost to the g league pacers still🤡When you win a bet against the @warriors @WorldWideWob https://t.co/f3B6rAGCVB@warriors We lost to the shittest team in the NBA cuz Curry can’t hit a open shot 🤦🏻‍♂️@nucero8 @RealGregMoore @warriors I know yall aren't talking.🙄🤣 https://t.co/EojoBsIx1f@warriors Needless to say, after losing like this to a team like this, I can’t see the warriors beating Houston anymore…Golden State Warriors 🤡🤡🤡warriors = Turnover Merchants .. No you cannot win turning over . @warriors@iWesliee @warriors He’s overrated coach idk what anyone says@BillyClosset @warriors Lakers lost to them yesterdayI don’t want any @warriors fans talking to me until May https://t.co/g4QlKVgVIi@warriors lol, seriously you tweeting this? Fought till the last min with G-league Pacers? Who is the leader of this team?🤡🤡@ZayCinema @BMACK_3 @warriors He sold the team in the clutch bro@warriors mane who is this dude taking these big shots???@warriors It's alright, you're gonna win by 35+ tmrw.@warriors Shoulda quit while he was ahead https://t.co/JKmhqKViWn@Money23Green come back soon we seriously need you 😭😭#GoldenStateWarriors@vibecheckviv @Ali_Szn14 @warriors kerr also bricked 3 3s in OT to win a ball game, sad case@warriors Good job, you guys been looking for that L. Well deserved 👏🏼@AnalAdvocate94 @NBA @Pacers @warriors We've already established thatThe @Pacers really came to Cali and beat the @Lakers &amp; @warriors on consecutive nights. That is #GoldBlooded@Dgls27 @warriors never could have won if a team shooting 9% from 3 without curryThanks for not fouling @warriors ….. you IDIOTS@warriors The Golden State Warrioyahhs have NOBODIES - flight reacts@wookrighterson @GodlLotus @warriors he didn't play ass so L@warriors And. Play JK.dat wasn't very 🅿️ of u tonight @warriors i bet $ on u fuckers@warriors Whoever took pacers to win won some serious money@RealGregMoore @warriors Ask the nets. TrailBlazers smoke their ass with bench guys as well.  Just goes to show the level of talent there is in the league@YCheeza @warriors And I was told the Warriors are the “BEST” team in the league and Curry is “MVP”

I’ve OFFICIALLY seen ENOUGH, Curry is becoming the most overrated player in the league… Do better CurHeldScoreless@DrStrangeBurner @warriors Kerr doesn't believe in that sadly@warriors Why JTA, ah…over GP|| and JK… while we struggling, oh come on 💔@warriors As good as Steph curry is, he is also anti clutch. Even on a good shooting game he still can't make em down the stretch@warriors We are shittttttttttttttt@ZayCinema @BMACK_3 @warriors How many in crunch time??@warriors https://t.co/96V7t4ryPl

Cmon bro@warriors Curry no clutch, bring KD back... Trade wiggins@warriors 🤣😂😁 lost to g-league@Blazersplzwin @warriors Held scoreless?! He had 39 points. Go watch a game for once you casual@stberniecaleb @imr3aler @warriors Yes but not the g-league pacers they had Brogdon , Levert and Sabonis@warriors Pitiful. Y’all need to straighten up your game and Kerr needs to work on the matchups. Just pitiful.@warriors Garbage@warriors No way@warriors Not hard enough #GoldBlooded@Killa2shooter @warriors He got a flagrantMaybe the @warriors should have practiced yesterday instead of playing baseball. 21 turnovers, lack of intensity, too many fouls, and how does the shot selection get worse each game?@warriors It has never been more obvious than right now how critical Draymond Green is to the Warriors success. Ever since he has been out with injury, we have been a subpar team, even with Klay back. Losing to lowly Indiana tonight after having a 3pt lead with 9 seconds left is proof.@warriors Wiggins, Klay, and Poole were 1-18 from 3. 5.5%. Yikes.@warriors Omg I'm sorry. But you will win again don't be sad@MasalaMan06 @warriors -Roots for miners and a generic HS sports team name and watches Loccer@ZyIiss @GodlLotus @warriors Yes the warriors lost tonight@warriors Losing to the extra depleted 13th place pacers team with no starters playing lmao@BookDaCoo @RealGregMoore @warriors How is Holiday a superstar? Are you sure you’re thinking of the right Holiday?@anthonyVslater @warriors Well looks like they needed the damn Practice 🤦🏽‍♀️@rahul_stuff @warriors sadly Wiseman and Klay is rusty too@youkapalot @warriors Idk about the out of slump, he sucked on three percentage wise@warriors Wrong pic@warriors Warriors becoming lazy on their offense instead working on their shooting they are playing baseball. Send Poole, Lee,JTA to the G league.@BMACK_3 @warriors Imagine hating on a guy who just dropped 39 and points and 8 assists🤡@ScharffReece69 @warriors Nope they actually had Sabonis , Levert and Brogdon not the G-league pacers@HonestPacersFan @warriors wtf dude is just a 10 day contract@Plazuhbtw @warriors Wdym he still dropped over 30 on y’all asses@warriors actually overrated. trade for ben simmons or trade everyone and rebuild@jordanh07961426 @warriors Seems like it’s getting worse from herePacers pagaba +1100 ML 💰

Cost them the game 🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶
Klay is washed in my eyes and warriors should trade him immediately 🔥🔥@warriors We lost. Doesn’t sound clutch. Maybe just me.@warriors Curry carrying I guess nothing has changed@warriors Congratulations Kerr 🤦🏻‍♂️@cyanshsharma007 @BillyClosset @warriors pulling out all the excuses 😭@warriors I dont get it why Toscano is shooting threes, stick to being a role player and pass the fucking ball to Klay/Steph@warriors Y’all lost to the Fort Wayne Mad Ants…@warriors YOU JUST LOST TO A REBUILDING TEAM 😹😹😹 https://t.co/1Sush1C0ob@warriors could've just fouled up 3 and the final buzzer would have been 5 minutes earlier with a W.@warriors Did we just lose to the pacers that have 4 starters missing 💀@ImSupaFreshh @warriors Pelicans clearMight be time to get honest and admit that the start of the season was mirage. This @warriors team is mid as hell.The full tank, missing all five starters, on the second night of a back to back, on the road Indiana Pacers beat the nearly full strength, rested, championship aspirational Golden State Warriors?

You love to see it.@warriors bricking till the final buzzerDid I really just watch my home team the Indiana Pacers defeat the Golden State Warriors in overtime? Do mine eyes deceive???@warriors Y’all pissed me off tonight https://t.co/0LteTWuzzG@TaylorTannebaum Back to back unexpected road wins for the @Pacers and now @Warriors! #GoldBlooded https://t.co/m5RCJQmi1V@Orochymaru_ @warriors No it isn’t GTFO the team played like TRASH all of them played horrible except Steph surprisingly@warriors trash 🤮@warriors We lost to Role Players@YCheeza @warriors Murray and MPJ are out@SkjodtBYKE @warriors Midwestern sports are dumb. Either draft a generational talent AND support them AND build around them AND shell out the money to keep them for their careers AND get lucky

OR

Live in mediocrity for ever.@jayvo1k_ @anthonyVslater @warriors Doesn't mean it had anything to do with not practicing.Embarrassing loss @warriors 🤦🤦🤦🤦@brasilcoast2 simplesmente Golden State warriors@35slimm @warriors Not frauds. We don’t have our DPOY playing.@warriors Who is this loss on?@warriors Fire Kerr NOW. It’s time to give him the frank Vogel treatment. His rotation is GARBAGE.
What’s your fucking obsession with Lee and Bjelica? Play your rookies for god sake 🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️@warriors Coach #Kerr with them bad lineups@djzee_couture @warriors We lost…@warriors Ooh God when is Green returning? This is so frustrating to watch@warriors Should've made an open three@DavidVe64270691 @imr3aler @warriors Did yall lose to them last night@guccigangharry @warriors Jta was clutch in the 4th. But in OT HE WAS AWFUL.@warriors WHAT. A. GAME! you did great Dubs!

The best players never get in rhythm@warriors Teams an absolute mess right now. 5-7 in our last 12. Kerr has apparently forgotten how to draw up a good play at the end of games. So frustrating when we started the year so good@warriors Fought? Nobody fought the pacers fought and won they shouldn’t of won but they did we suck and it’s showing draymond green is very needed this offense is so shit without 20 plus more turnovers@warriors Pacers bench players exposed the Splash bros and Warriors. Warriors will not even get pass the first round. Curry too busy golfing than making shots. Klay ain’t the same and the rest of them still green.@warriors Lee out, Kuminga &gt;&gt;&gt; Iggy, Kerr Please?@warriors But easier since the next game is tomorrow so hopefully we can get another of the bulls game tomorrow. Let’s bounce back@warriors Why did Kerr put Kuminga in the doghouse??? https://t.co/fDC6NyLicU@messi7lm @RealGregMoore @warriors Imagine talkin' shit and have Pessi as your pfp@warriors omg its pacers@GavinCurrin @BillyClosset @warriors The Pacers starters were there at the Lakers game...@warriors my guys are outthere looking pretty weak for the second half of the #season I really don't know if yell want this thing yell are really looking like winded high school kids@SFGarrett @anthonyVslater @warriors Called it@GavinCurrin @BillyClosset @warriors We're supposed to be a championship team not whatever the fuck this is.

Let’s get them tomorrow!  #chinup@messi7lm @warriors Stick to soccer BOT🥴@guccigangharry @warriors I think jta is okay in the clutch when he has a good game, but when he has a subpar game?

More complete team with a more versatile offense.@GodlLotus @warriors Bruh Steph choked@rahul_stuff @warriors you root for the chicken nuggets &amp; patriots bud@warriors And I was told the Warriors are the “BEST” team in the league and Curry is “MVP”

(Which the warriors are). Pacers are pretty deep too.@HonestPacersFan @warriors lowest paid current nba player vs highest paid current nba player 😑😹@DavidVe64270691 @warriors So did the lakers yesterday@warriors Disappointing@warriors Steve kerr Holly shit 😭😭@warriors Weak-ass warriors@Pacers win ! @Pacers win ! @Pacers win ! @warriors @NBA@youkapalot @warriors Should of fouled at the end@JayLGK @warriors We still don’t have green sadly@warriors Baseball pa more 😬@warriors Golden state warriors una.

Thank you Steve Kerr for wasting 3 hours of our time@warriors Go to sleep warriors only fixing how much money pick this day  waste game, waste players are in this game@warriors Y’all really lost to this starting lineup https://t.co/mzOzFMLAnS@warriors can y’all please have a game where we limit turnovers and stop fuckin fouling everyone@warriors we ass@warriors When you play like garbage, you lose to teams that are garbage and having to use bench players as their starters were out. This should’ve been an easy W, but they played like shit and deserved this L. Hopefully they play better at the Rockets but I’m not counting on it.@warriors FUCK.@warriors Steve kerr and klay false tonight@warriors idk how y’all even won 32 games.

No passion to win games. No killing instinct! Playing tired…🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️@warriors This might be the most embarrassing loss in the Kerr era. This team had a win gift wrapped to them and the comedically and miserably blew it. Screw the needing OT, when you can’t beat THESE pacers AT HOME, that’s beyond embarrassingshame on you @warriors@warriors You didn’t fight worth 💩! That’s a 🗑 effort all the way around!!!!!!!!!@warriors YIIIIKES. Tight race with the Suns for the 1 seed and y'all lose to a G-League Indiana team💀@Plazuhbtw @warriors Should have 43 cause there were 2 uncalled fouls@kkwessi @warriors Tonight?   They have been playing like this for the past month.Poor game management for me in this game. @warriors we had a foul to give with 3points up and secs to go. We should have fouled before they got the pass and shot off in regular time to tie the game. This should be a Dub for us. Poor game management!@bronbetta23 @warriors Such a casual comment. Nobody was clutch this game.@warriors Wow what a game sucks we lost but we still fought hard. Good game to the pacers@warriors Disgusting and disappointing, Yikes!!!!@warriors Fought where?@warriors ruined steph masterclass@messi7lm @RealGregMoore @warriors Even more than the &lt;.500 lakers?I hope @Warriors won’t show up against my @HoustonRockets tomorrow. #Rockets@warriors WHY ISNT LOONEY PLAYING IN THE FINAL MINUTES KERR. IGGY ISNT DOING SHI@DB868 @warriors Tuscano-Anderson is a joke, could of ended the game with a simple layup, didn’t even hit rim. Had a wide open 3 in OT missed it… Careless with the ball. I lost a lil something too, it’s sickening@warriors Can u tell Steph not to choke for once@warriors 11.5% from 3 by everyone not named Curry. Embarassing.@warriors Disgusting performance@therealselena23 @warriors Facts@30isGod @warriors We are nothing without Draymond Green.@upnextdavid @warriors You just copied this, be original
Get this ratio@warriors Good thing we have Loon on this team. #KevonLooney #NBAAllStar@wtfgaily @warriors they better win by 60 with steph and klay masterclass😂@warriors Curry got no help tonight. My bet is he doesn't play tomorrow and there's the chance of another clanker.  Lee, Toscano, Wiggins, Poole - awful.@warriors This just proves kerr is only a “good coach” cause he’s been sourrounded with MVP type players his whole coaching career@messi7lm @kkwessi @warriors You probably like soccer@warriors I don't care if you fought, this is one of the most embarrassing loss of the last 10 years@RealGregMoore @WinPlsdamn @warriors Fuck Steve Kerr, that’s what i’ve been saying!! Why play JTA over GP2 ?@warriors Trash@warriors Half those players won’t even be in the league next year and they just beat “the best team in the nba” 😂😂😂@warriors arriors because you couldn’t get the W 😂😂😂 down bad@warriors Warriors fans clowning the lakers to losing to the pacers starters and than warriors losing to the pacers bench the next day 😂 clockwork@warriors I’m Arresting Kerr for War Crimes https://t.co/nhLGm1uLxU@warriors QUIT TURNING THE BALL OVER OVER 20 TOS@Plazuhbtw @warriors He had 40@warriors What a joke lakers the other night now the warriors too come on guys get it together 🤦‍♂️@TTicklezz @warriors What we need is to make the right decisions and the right moves. Russ has to go. Stanley has to play much more than Melo and Ariza. And get solid sized wings like Kenrich Williams and Torey Craig using 2nds@warriors If y'all had taken care of business in the 2nd quarter, y'all wouldn't NEED to fight to the end.@warriors Cmon klay 🤨 this one was on you man🙃@chefwardell_30 @warriors CurbrickSources tell Based that Golden State Warriors Head Coach Steve Kerr's status at the helm is "day-to-day" after a depleted Pacers unit defeated his team off a back-to-back.@imr3aler @warriors Ok at least we didn’t lose to a G-league pacers team 💀@blackhonee @warriors Damn I had them winning this one by 15 plus easily@warriors Very disappointing match… Bad offense… so many fouls 😔I hope y’all give @drae_money5 his due respect knowing how important he is for the @warriors to win. Without him, na ah this team won’t even get past 2nd round of the playoffs.@warriors  go get a center🤣🤣🤣That last shot should not have gone to @StephenCurry30. Wide open shot and missed #IWantIguodala
@warriors @maxkellerman @Pacers https://t.co/EnRLBZtPqR@warriors does Kerr have an explanation for not putting GP2 and Klay during those crucial moments?!@warriors lost to the b team of pacers@warriors Y do y’all got some of the weakest inbounds plays in crunch times"Live by the 3 die by the 3."

Also, for Warriors fans at the arena, please don't cry after a regular season loss. It's not that deep. Don't do that.@warriors Not another coach that plays his stars less than Steve Kerr does. I'm chalking it up to Steve Kerr being racist because there's simply no reason for Kuminga to not be getting clutch time minutes with his skillset and finishing. https://t.co/wuoaQcjs3Z🤣🤣🤣 @warriors #warriors blew it... a few times!!! 🤣🤣@warriors We could have won! more that's it Let's go Warriors 💙💛@warriors Needed the Warriors straight up at -800 on Draft Kings to win a 7 team parlay and they do this 😭Embarrassing @warriors not worth staying up until 6am UK time.

Will be interesting to see what Kerr's reaction is postgame. Has to be Golden State's worst loss of the season.Suns now lead the Warriors by 3.5 games for the top spot in the NBA/West after a loss for Golden State to the Pacers.

Chris Paul said last week the team has it as a goal to hold that spot so Monty Williams and the coaching staff get to coach at the All-Star Game.@warriors Are you sure about that?@warriors GP2 needs more mins give him all of D Lees minsyall messn up money for me maaannn @warriors 😒😒😒😒Disappointment L @warriorsgolden state warriors@valverdecentraI @warriors As long as you bought your season tickets already, it's not their problem 🤷‍♂️@warriors you just fucked my whole day@warriors @NBCSAuthentic awful o.t. for Steph@warriors @NBCSAuthentic Disgraceful getting beat by a team with only 11 players, you guys need a gut check.

https://t.co/IIuYCTQkL5#Pacers  injury list: Brogdon, McConnell, LeVert, Warren, Sabonis, Turner. That’s an entire starting five and sixth man. This same team just took down the Golden State Warriors who are a top 3 team in the league. AFTER beating the Lakers the night before. I love this team. 💛💙@warriors just lost to the @Pacers in #OT@JmWou @Petsin_Fn @djzee_couture @warriors Hold that L 🤣@GorillaMna @warriors Lavine at the 5 https://t.co/EZqmQomVgXIndiana Pacers probably just had the most improbable win of this NBA season. 16.5-point underdogs on the second night of a road back-to-back at the 32-12 Golden State Warriors while playing without Domantas Sabonis, Myles Turner, Malcolm Brogdon and Caris LeVert, plus others.e o nosso golden state warriors hein?What a ducking joke @warriors bums@Pacers without all of their starters with perhaps the upset of the year against the mighty @warriors.@warriors @NBCSAuthentic Y’all got into a dog fight against a depleted @Pacers team and couldn’t beat them in regulation or overtime 😑The Indiana Pacers have upset the Warriors at Chase Center down 7 guys, on a back to back. 

121 to 117. 

15.5 underdogs and they win this game against all odds. 

What a awful loss for the dubs on this 7 game homestand. 
This is the 4th home loss for Golden State. 
#INDvsGSWIt is CRAZY how night &amp; day the Warriors are without Draymond Green.

#GoldenStateWarriorsyikes @warriorswe winning tmr right @warriors  ?#fraudwatch Golden State WarriorsLMFAO dog food @warriors@warriors You guys wouldn’t have been in this position if you didn’t play like shit tonightBunch of bums @warriorsWorst lost of the season. @warriorsTf were y’all thinking @warriors I sweartahgod y’all stress me tf out with all these fuckin starters out you still lose a game you could have won in regulationPacers beat LeBron's Lakers and Steph's Warriors on back-to-back nights minus Myles Turner in both games and all key cogs except rookie Chris Duarte missing at Golden State. By mandate, Rick Carlisle is now the greatest coach ever. Duarte is back in ROY race. These are the rules.If it isn’t obvious yet, the @warriors aren’t making out the West w/ only one guy who can consistently create O off-the-bounce (but doesn’t get the chance to do it throughout the game), and a limited frontline. Not gonna happen.Juan Tuscano needs to just not take any threes or lay ups as he can’t make none…. Most useless person.#GoldenStateWarriors@warriors Kerr and his stupid ass rotations show up against@warriors @NBCSAuthentic Where’s the Tweets ??? 🦗🦗🦗🦗🦗🦗🦗🦗🦗Coach Kerr had a bad game today.

What happened to that intensity and tenaciousness you started the year with?  Kerr isn't helping with those shit rotations either.  Pick your 11 guys and the rest sit until if/when needed@TTicklezz @warriors The Pacers are without Brogdon, Levert, and Sabonis. All those guys played against usPathetic @warriorsWith all their starters out @Pacers just beat the @warriors 
@Lakers couldn’t dream of anything like that!!#NBA @warriors be losing to G League Pacers I can’t even 🤦‍♂️As a Suns fan, it brings me much joy that the 16-29 Pacers, missing some of their most key players and getting some key minutes from Torrey Craig, flexed all over the 32-12 Warriors in overtime.
