What are you talking about? You know who is the only team who has (or will have) three 20+ PPG scorers? THE BROOKLYN NETS. Also, you‚Äôre somehow forgetting that the Nets have a better DEF than both of those team‚Äôs this season@WestGoat @BleacherReport @BrooklynNets Nets only getting Kyrie back for away games.
