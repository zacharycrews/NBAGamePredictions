Yes, it took 50 years for the Bucks to win a 2nd chip. There are a lot of factors that went into that. Things change. Die mad about it.@Michael8easley @Bucks we bringing back all these former Bucks.

I will be buying birthday hats to wear for @Giannis_An34's birthday.@Bucks Please give him a 💍 with ❤️@g_money_stud @MarkHamptonHK @GameTechSudios @TheNBACentral @FoxSportsRadio Literally this. Plus adding in, the poor decision making in from the Bucks that Giannis typically makes up for half the time. The series may not even go to 7. That's before you get to who Milwaukee could even think to put on Giannis. Brook?...PJ? 😂😂Living in Athens is an experience itself, but walking by the Athenian neighbourhood of a legend, is something else @Giannis_An34 #antetokoumpo #greekfreak #mvp #nba #athens #sepolia #Greece @Bucks https://t.co/K69LNnR5rb@MotshidisiM @Seseki Okay teams to watch are

Really liking the Cavs tomorrow. Coming into Milwaukee on a 1 point L vs the Bucks who are coming off of a blowout revenge victory. Not sure why Giannis status will be but +8 is a gift. Cavs are 9-2-1 ATS on the road. The one drawback is MIL owns them. 1/2...@Bucks 29 minutes until you have to post Giannis birthday@Bucks Jesusemilore Talodabijesu "Semi" Ojeleye is an American professional basketball player for the Milwaukee Bucks of the National Basketball Association.

Pretty sure since bud has been here they haven't missed the playoffs once.  Nice try though sweetheart.@ashan1738 @Bucks RatioI predicted the #Rockets would go on a six-game winning streak. Easy schedule. Here come the hard part. 

The Milwaukee Bucks and Brooklyn Nets come into town. If they get Jalen Green back in time for the Nets, they have a chance but not against Bucks sadly. I could be wrong.@jsbettah @Bucks I care@Bucks Nobody cares@BangoBurner @Bucks waited all day to say it cuz he's a bum 😭@Bucks but admin can u be sure to post giannis bday tmrw early@Bucks ur late@EricStokesSzn3 @Bucks Real cute coming from a bandwagoner.@Lagowitz @Bucks @Giannis_An34 You guys look so good!@Bucks AND HBD@Bucks LEMME GET A FOLLOWHappy Birthday, Semi!! 🥳 https://t.co/CLpbxRHEEu@SepehrEskandar1 @johnwall_s @statmuse @BPortistime @Giannis_An34 @Bucks Not only that, i bet the man is making bank with some of his brand products.

Bucks arent any better then the raptors@dwreckBTW @HerroSexuals @logan_palmer_44 @highimjasonn @Bucks @BPortistime @pconnaughton By what metric do you think the Bucks are one and done? When healthy this team is better than last year's. It's not like the Raptors where their superstar left after winning.

Will the Bucks become a "dynasty"? Who knows? But discounting the possibility is absurd.
