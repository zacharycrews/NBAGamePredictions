Wpwgx@NBA @dallasmavs @warriors I doubt Mavs can win but I hope they do. No NBA fan outside of Warriors fan base wants to see GSW in the finals. Ever since GSW bought two rings by signing KD, watching Warriors became boring. @NBA if you want good ratings for the finals, don’t help GSW win.

Probably...@NBAonTNT @dallasmavs @warriors If the GSW want to win/possibly sweep dallas,just make luka look human and harass him right from inbound(full court press).Make him have to handle the ball and wear him out.Don’t let him just walk up to the 3 point line and start cooking up his magic! #NBAonTNT  #DALvsGSW@warriors Why tf is looney in the starting lineup🔴𝐆𝐨 𝐎𝐧 𝐋𝐢𝐯𝐞📺@nbaliveiistream

He can score 40+ and still Mavs lose because they are not gonna be able to match the Warrior's scoring.  Do you think Mavs will be able to stop the Warriors?@warriors Wow Rebounding is gonna be great and lots of second chances but Luka gonna hide on Looney@Michael_2221X @AIsKarma @TheHoopCentral @warriors Ur right he doesn’t.

Dallas and Golden State! 
TONIGHT 830 on @939TheVille https://t.co/tu5EVLhJJ6Honestly, i think this is the first time i feel after so many years of dominance and rebuilding, @warriors don't feel so comfortable. maybe, reminiscing 2015 when no one thought they could do this. 

I don't mind being wrong, but Warriors in 7.@TheHoopCentral @warriors Dubs@terry_bartlett @WUTangKids @warriors I was on the east coast for work last October trying to watch @SFGiants games with first pitch at 10:30pm!!! Horrible!!@Braeddyn @Luka77GOAT @WisemanFan @TheHoopCentral @warriors Lol it’s funny because they’re loud and don’t even know something that’s common knowledge. It was because the games played as many voters noted.

He is nowhere the caliber defender of Giannis, Bam, Gobert, Jrue and etc. are. It was his availability and they wanted to reward it.@GoldinCo @KenGoldin @luka7doncic @StephenCurry30 @dallasmavs @warriors @PaniniAmerica @beckettcollect @PSAcard @NBA Warriors 112-105@warriors in 6 🏀 up.@warriors @Oracle take care of the ball jp@jorgoat23better @warriors W videoWill the @dallasmavs win or will the @warriors lose? #WCF #mavs@Stephen_302 @NBA @dallasmavs @warriors Mavs V Celtics would be great. 23yo Luka vs 24yo Tatum.

Mavs 107I don’t think the Warriors will stop Luka, I just don’t think Luka can keep up with the Warriors alone.

Pass the ball and play Warriors brand basketball!@Outkassst @warriors @NBAonTNT @957thegame @kpthrive 2nd seed for a reason?@N3moHoez @NBAonTNT @warriors @dallasmavs Kevin Durant is in Brooklyn tf is wrong with youThe last 4 teams left in the playoffs are carbon copies of the @warriors championship blueprint when it comes to building a team. Foundation is 3 &amp; D with a superstar. Unfortunately for them, GSW have the best shooters. Imitated, never duplicated. #GoldBlooded@NBAonTNT @warriors @dallasmavs If you thought the Grizzlies were a threat, then check out the Mavs sprinkled with a little Luka magic. Warriors players are resilient but their fans are disrespectful 👎🏽.Questa notte ore 3.00, su @SkySport  e @SkySportNBA  @warriors vs @dallasmavs 🏀🔥

#NBAPlayoffs #NBA #WCF #SkySport https://t.co/VEOWYmid3c@Aviles1910 @NBAonTNT @warriors @dallasmavs I remember that the Warriors have a pretty good record in game 1 of a playoff series so I looked it up. The warriors are an incredible 20-2 in Game 1s. I don’t put a lot of weight into that type of stat though- the warriors at home, lots of rest but still think Dallas wins thisWe bet 2 Teams to come out the WEST: 
Phoenix +250 50K 
Golden State +550 50k

We played the Timberwolves and the game went into OT. We only had eight guys suit up. Rony Seikaly seemed like he had 100 points (it was only 31).

I was hooked.

Legitimately, the Warriors have 4 or 5 players better than the 2nd best player on the Mavs.  Luka, Kidd, &amp; team defense are what help balance the scale.@N6A_Paul @N3moHoez @CameronHieb @NBAonTNT @warriors @dallasmavs google exists for a reason https://t.co/nvHGNF9fHr@caelwell17 @CameronHieb @NBAonTNT @warriors @dallasmavs They’ve won without him sir, he didn’t play during the blowout@FirstTake @KDTrey5 @MadDogSirius @MollyQerim @stephenasmith KD should’ve stayed @warriors .

So, i want the #Warriors to take out those #Mavericks in 6 or less games ! 😬 😂 https://t.co/vPwl1Kbwqf@NBA @dallasmavs @warriors Dallas wins if Draymond gets ejected, Steph goes 2 for 15, Klay gets reinjured, and Luka goes for 60. Which oddly enough could happen..this year superstars or game changers get “injured”and have changed the whole series..let see what happens!!@warriors I am ready 🥰All the sports media are taking the Golden State Warriors to win the series but at the same time calling them the Underdogs? All the while their fans think Steph is going to run circles around our fat boy??? This is why I avoid the “NBA figure heads” and these spaces Lmao https://t.co/jbfHKWNICr@raashaan @warriors Agree.

They don’t have anyone that can truly take over. That’s why they need Ja to be apart of the team. He is too big of an accent when it come to the stretch of the game.Golden State warriors needs to do 3 things to stand a chance against Maverick Dallas tonight:

1. Avoid turnovers
2. That same turnovers, reduce it.
3. Still on the turnovers, avoid THEM!!!

😒😒😑😑😏😏@DannyRo59875195 @danilitos @NBAonTNT @warriors @dallasmavs Does this Dallas team have more championship experience than the Warriors? I think you’re confused as to what the word experience means.@ingoracks @FirstTake The East Will not win the @NBA Championship this season. The @warriors or @dallasmavs will beat either team coming out the Eastern Conference. I don't trust @JimmyButler or @jaytatum0 to lead their teams to the finals.

@RSportsTime #realsportstimepodcast@N3moHoez @NBAonTNT @warriors @dallasmavs 4-2 series. Close games that went down to the wire. Plus you lost Payton.@Jermain90922702 @NBA @dallasmavs @warriors Who did he win a ring with?@NBA @dallasmavs @warriors Watched ESPN all morning&amp; The question wud b " How to defeat the Warriors kus there the fav "
And the first thing the analysts says: How u guard Luka, and shutdown the other Mavs.
We should be discussing how to beat the Warriors Not how u beat the #4 seed. Y da focus on da Mavs?!@K2_ANT @NBAonTNT @dallasmavs @warriors Luka was mostly hunting switches*@N3moHoez @CameronHieb @NBAonTNT @warriors @dallasmavs Ja only played half the series 💀💀@SteveKo96181773 @NBAonTNT @warriors @dallasmavs Yet here you are.@K2_ANT @NBAonTNT @dallasmavs @warriors No it was the Mavs roleplayers shooting their ass's of hitting every 3. They carried Luka in the 4th quarter and was mostly hunting switches onto bigger player not PG and Kawhi@givemesome_rope @NBAonTNT @warriors @dallasmavs Sounds like someone on the Mavs banged your mom.I personally think this is a horrible matchup for the @warriors. Luka is almost as big as GSs starting center Looney. His ability in the paint and as well as Brunson's strength attacking the hoop could be an extremely tough cover defensively. And help will lead to wide open 3s. https://t.co/5iBKYon23fForward Otto Porter Jr. came off the NBA injury report for the Golden State Warriors, putting him back in the mix for their playoff rotation against the Mavericks in the Western Conference finals.

From game 3 whenever suns picked on Luka rather than simply letting them switch they immediately put pressure on the ball. No one in suns is gifted to find pass in traps like Luka or Jokic.Then Luka slide off This was to avoid preswitch communication issueI envision the @dallasmavs vs @warriors series going down EXACTLY how the Phoenix series did for Dallas.

Minimize ur turnovers to 10 or less. Don't rush ur offense. B. Be aggressive on defense and guard the perimeter. C. Play hard for 48 mins, specially during the 4th Q.
Go Warriors! 
@esfajardo2003@Phounmeister3 @paulbassoon @DogSurfRoadshow @warriors Some Dub fans were even clamoring for the Warriors to drop to 4th seed cause Jazz were seen as the softest possible first rd opponent for them.They didn't duck the back2back MVP.Took him head on and gave him a gentleman's sweep.Mannnn.

Boston was without 40% of it’s starters &amp; dominated the majority of the game despite essentially not playing the 3rd Q &amp; half of the 4th Q.

@Giannis_An34 had a bigger impact on G1 than @JimmyButler. 😉

Late Dec. ‘21, @Celtics are sub-500 10-seed in the East. C’s finish 22-23 a 2-seed in stacked East. It happened bc @smart_MS3 believed in &amp; elevated his teammates.

My original point was only that the numbers actually favored Boston and not Miami. I wasn’t saying that the win differential stat is the reason why the Celtics will win the series.

Tied with the Mavs. So then it comes to offense. Golden State has had ridiculous offenses under their core 3. They had the number one offense this year. Mavs were 10th. It might be competitive, but I got the Warriors.@MelissasProduce @celtics @MiamiHEAT @warriors @dallasmavs @NBA Celtics vs Warriors @Wander4PurposeThe Miami Heat Turnt 🆙 In The 2nd Half YassssLord🎚 I Love It,I’ma Loyal 2My TrillionDollarKey 🔑Golden State Warriors💎,The Heat Cool With Me🏀 https://t.co/VBLJS8te6FWarriors fans kill me. GP2 did not stop Ja Morant no matter how you spin it or whatever bs stat you came up with. That man dropped 30+ the entire series. Got lucky he got hurt too. Ja specifically was dog walking Golden State. Can't wait till next year. https://t.co/WzdYmtPbHzThe Miami Heat are pulling a Vintage Golden State Warriors 3rd quarter avalanche on the Celtics 🤣For the non-hockey fan, the @Avalanche are the hockey equivalent to the 2018-19 @warriors . Just a run and gun, puck movement, talented team. And yeah, I realize the Warriors didn’t win it but same style of play.Golden State is ready😤😤😤😤
