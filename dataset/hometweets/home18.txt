Please lose on Saturday to the Cleveland Cavaliers. If this happens, the Braves will go to the World Series. If you guys win, then we have to rely on the Falcons losing, which is always a toss up. Please make our lives easier.

You are one of the best ever and I really really enjoyed watching you and Kobe play together 👍 you guys are two of my favorites and what you guysI know the news surrounding Kyrie isn’t so good right now @cavs but the Cavs were just a different product with LeBron and Kyrie than with just LeBron. It really disturbs me that this didn’t get recognized more.@cavs @goodyear @isaacokoro303 I have the monthly package, I see my preseason tickets from earlier, but when will my tickets for tomorrow be put into my account?@dariusgarland22 We don't need you to be a hero or cute, we need you to execute.

Will also be going to the @cavs game on Saturday if you're into that sort of thing. DM me if you're tryna go@Reflog_18 Nice to see @cavs STILL cannot defend ball screen at all, and all talk about committing to defense translates to "holding" Grizz to 73 1ST HALF POINTS!  Time for a new voice in the locker room..Perhaps Evan Mobley did change the trajectory of the Cleveland Cavaliers franchise after playing only game?

Perhaps, the Cleveland Plain Dealer is a terrible source of news that is owned and operated by communists?
