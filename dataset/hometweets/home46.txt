https://t.co/PjvK1e5KWfJust like we all thought, the Minnesota Timberwolves have the best defensive efficiency in the NBA after the opening week

Allowing 87.8 pp/100

SSS be damned (I’m having fun!) their defense really has been quite good!'I get to work with the best athletes on the planet' 

The dietitian for the NBA's Minnesota Timberwolves says he owes some of the credit for his career to his days as the head coach of Mount Saint Vincent University's men's soccer team

While I think he eventually figures it out and becomes a rotation guy, the Minnesota Timberwolves did well in getting Patrick Beverley.Warriors fans really tried to blame Minnesota timberwolves player development for Wiggins not living up to his contract ...The Minnesota Timberwolves have scored 1.24 points per possession in transition in 2021-22 (5th in NBA).

At 106.75 possessions per game, the Wolves have been playing at a breakneck pace (2nd in NBA).

Scary combination of transition volume + efficiency.
