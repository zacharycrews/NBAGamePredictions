@Suns #basketball@iamnameless___ @swaveyquis That's because Steph doesn't flop 😂 It's unfortunate, but true. And over half of his shots he took were 3s. Like, I get it, Steph can make that 3 over McGee, but the difference between the Suns and other teams is Phoenix just doesn't give open shots. They are insanely...@BlqMgck Nothing? How many national TV games do the Suns get when they are bad. Now how many do the Knicks, Lakers, Bulls, etc get when they are bad? I bet they get a whole lot more than the Suns.

That was my point@Joshhhh05850858 @fauzangiri @DetroitPistons @Suns @BallySportsDET @971theticketxyt @Shopify @FootprintCNTR It might, idk how a full game without Dbook would look + for some reason they always take the pedal off the gas in “expected” wins.@ChristopherGnrd @Suns Oh hey handsome! 🥰😍@iamnameless___ @swaveyquis Yes, I do. I watched that game and had money it. He was great defensively, Reggie Jackson didn't even score; however, the Clippers are nowhere near as efficient as the Suns offensively.

It's not OK.@ChriswClay @Jumpshot8 @ShannonSharpe @undisputed @Lakers @SacramentoKings @warriors @Suns The whole metro area is almost 5 million people, actually more populous than San Fransisco, for crying out loud.

Phoenix is literally the fifth largest city in the country, just behind Houston. Sure, L.A. is second, but Phoenix is hardly small market.

No, he did not. U know how I know? Because he has literally NEVER shot so badly before. He did not just have a bad night. He had his worst night literally ever. And it was because Bridges shut. Him.
