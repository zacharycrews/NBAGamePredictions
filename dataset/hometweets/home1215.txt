ALL I know is the Nets cant stop ANYBODY and you know it!!

That’s nerve wracking@wilborn_lane47 @PsAndQss @ValtGang @wojespn Bucks and grizzlies resting starters today so Celtics would probably be the 2 seed and rn Brooklyn is 7 so they would play in playoffs.

Moral of story so fire im gettin@BrooklynNets @KDTrey5 @Patty_Mills @daviddukejr None of those players would survive in the 1960s@KeithSmithNBA Ideal path for what the 2nd seed &amp; the Brooklyn Nets? I think not. They’re not trying to do that. Neither is Milwaukee. They’re already starting to maneuver and call in sick to secure the 3rd seed to avoid Brooklyn. It’s a big difference between playing Bklyn or playing Chicago.The Nets would need Kyrie and KD to score 60-70+ points every game in a series against the Celtics which isnt as easy as it seems w/ Cs defense. It's going to be hard for Brooklyn to win without home court advantage.

Cavs knocking out BKYLN would give this team that next level confidence. 

Also losing to the Nets and losing the other games to retain our draft pick doesn't seem bad either.

#LetEmKnow@Stephen38135252 If the Cavs and Hornets both win, and the Nets lose, Brooklyn drops to 9.What the Sixers need to do. Lose tonight to get the 4 seed. The Nets to win out and get the 7 seed. If we win round 1 we face Miami in round 2 instead of Boston Milwaukee Brooklyn.@KingWarren3rd @BrooklynNets You do not have the personnel for that@BrooklynNets Pls pls review how the raptors 2019 and Miami defense 2021 did to Giannis https://t.co/ZcMpmPyAEJ@mkay12_ @BrooklynNets Not if it’s the playoffs, Joey Buckets, non existenceBeing the last game of the regular season it concludes my first full year as a real season ticket holder. Met a lot of the #Netsworld family this year from Twitter to in person. Love this family and team. Renew already for the next season. It’s our world. @BrooklynNets 🏀🔥🙏🏾💯 https://t.co/xb7v2Dlg3P https://t.co/LtCmYUUORX@aohughes @PaulReedWrld @BrooklynNets whatever helps you sleep at night man. you'll see eventuallyi hope the brooklyn nets don’t get the 8th seed@PaulReedWrld @aohughes @BrooklynNets Yea, he didn't shoot. We know. But he played lockdown D on Trae, facilitated the offense, and rebounded, which we suck at this year. The same thing that happened to him is slowly happening to Tobi and Harden. They're too focused on getting Jo the ball and can't score themselvesLooking ahead to today’s game — The Nets have won the past six games against the Pacers going into today’s game. A win today would officially set Brooklyn as the 7-seed in the Play-In. 

It’ll be interesting to see how 2-4 East seeds play out today as well.@TheNBACentral @BrooklynNets @AhnFireDigital We do this every yearGet that W today 🏀🙏🏻🤍🖤 @BrooklynNets @KyrieIrving @KDTrey5 @BruceBrown11 @_claxton33 @KesslerEdwards @blakegriffin23 @sdotcurry @AndreDrummond @aldridge_12@aohughes @PaulReedWrld @BrooklynNets How is that casual? I just gave you clesr stats. You've probably never even been to a Sixers playoff game before lol. I even went down to Georgia last year for the Atlanta series@Eternity9 @BrooklynNets Just let the young teams Cavs, Hawks and Hornets attempt to get in the playoffs they weren't expected to contend for a championship this season. If they lose to Milwaukee the defending champions or top seed Miami those teams rep won't look bad as the Nets losing in the 1st round.@ShenkKyle @PaulReedWrld @BrooklynNets You are such a casual, I can’t even.@NetsOnYES @Grady @BrooklynNets @NBA @ChrisShearnYES @TheFrankIsola @sarahkustok @YESNetwork And this was the exact viewing of this year,showed some champions esk performances away &amp; some absolute stinking bottom of the league performances at home.@ShenkKyle @PaulReedWrld @BrooklynNets Well Ben has always been consistent in the playoffs. Consistently bad. He ain’t playing.@Eternity9 @BrooklynNets Not to my knowledge the Nets with their season been a major disappointment they should be the team that just say screw it not worrying about making the playoffs this season where they will get beat in the first round. They are supposed to be championship contenders this year.@TheNBACentral @BrooklynNets @AhnFireDigital Any normal hooper can do that lol@BrooklynNets Much love @BrooklynNets @KyrieIrving@minakimes @BrooklynNets You know Dabo never said he was against players using the free market to make money. https://t.co/Fn1b29reesIf the Cavaliers win today, The Cavaliers will face the Brooklyn Nets in the 7 vs. 8 Play in game. it will air at 7pm on April, 12 on TNT.

Would of been nice though!!Someone in Nets spaces yesterday said the only two teams that can score a ton of points quickly in the league were Brooklyn and Golden State. Memphis would like a word.@BrooklynNets yall forced kai into this@BrooklynNets Bruce is only fuckin around 😂@James_Blairx @NBA @KDTrey5 @BrooklynNets Best player in the league is Lucas doncic but he white.problem.@BrooklynNets Got it at the game last night.

Option A: Play Nets 1st round 
Option B: Play Bulls 1st round and the winner of a definitely grueling series between BOS/PHI vs Brooklyn. https://t.co/xLwPCXGRQvIf Milwaukee bucks vs Brooklyn Nets happen at the east first rounf playoffs. Who do you got ? KD or Giannis ?

We could use @MetLifeStadium stadium for a @nyknicks game and(or) @BrooklynNets@berrywtw @BrooklynNets whole team tho?Meet Brooklyn Beckham's billionaire in-laws Nelson and Claudia Peltz with epic net worth - Mirror Online | @scoopit https://t.co/tIYJ8Ol6MjFor 54 years, Herb Turetzky was the official scorer of the Brooklyn Nets franchise. He charted field goals, assists and rebounds as the team moved from the A.B.A. to the N.B.A. and played in eight local arenas. He has died at 76. https://t.co/APrrzDSRmA@BrooklynNets This would be great to have! Thanks for the opportunity to win this! 🙌🤞⚫️⚪️The star-studded Brooklyn Nets won’t win the NBA championship and Andrew Bogut can’t see Ben Simmons making a difference if he returns from his back injury. Read his column now. 

https://t.co/qoKqIJ94KYThe 76ers will travel back to Philly in hopes to eliminate the Brooklyn Nets. The series is currently 3-1.@robinlundberg Even though they didn't I still believe the @BrooklynNets  with KD can beat the Bucks and any other team in the Eastern and Western Conferences. People gotta stop saying not the Bucks in round 1. Stop running from the challenge and embrace it. Fear no man or team! ✌️😐In thinking about the increasing likelihood of facing Brooklyn in round one, I will say this: The only sustainable formula for beating the Celtics these past 3 months is playing elite lockdown defense and taking it to another level in crunchtime.
That… does not describe the NetsFor me:

1) Miami Heat
2) Brooklyn Nets
3) Boston Celtics
4) Milwaukee Bucke
5) Philadephia 76ers
6) Cleveland Cavaliers
7) Toronto Raptors
8) Chicago Bulls

And I think all 8 teams would have close records@Larry_924 @UFANYC @KyrieIrving @BrooklynNets @nyknicks @Yankees @Mets @NYRangers @NYCFC @SenSchumer @RepYvetteClarke @NydiaVelazquez What percentage are you paying?

Dont you pay your own?

That's the deal

You work you pay 

You dont work you live off a system and ultimately may become unemployed on welfare or homeless

It probably will not happen but would it not be just deserts if Kyrie infected KD or other teammates? Then they would be brothers in protocol.@BrooklynNets Die hard brooklyn fan and so is my son https://t.co/CUoSmEGwFY@BrooklynNets ME PLEASE I'M BEGGING@balldontstop @BrooklynNets What?

Brooklyn nets suckBucks don’t want the Nets. Boston takes the 2 see cause the 6ers are ass. Boston and Brooklyn first round. C’s in 6. LFG. https://t.co/bW3K74rTk5@BrooklynNets @KDTrey5 Jesus! He has the dimensions of a crackhead! Amazing his stability and gracefulness on the court. He just may be the best basketball player in the world built like Pookie on New Jack City.@deathrowdj Bucks won 2 on the road vs Miami in the 1st round to win the series

Beat the nets @ Brooklyn in game 7 to win the series 

Beat the hawks in Atlanta in game 6 to win the series 

Beat suns game 5 in Phoenix. 

I 100% doubt they care about home court advantage.@KyrieIrving been a Brooklyn Nets

Great win for the Nets https://t.co/skNhIkpKdp@BrooklynNets He missed around and almost got a triple double. That’s what we need from him in the playoffs. Play harder and do the dirty work. Those four blocks and those rebounds were more important than the assists and points. Those were just a bonus. Great job Bruce. Keep it up.
