To properly rebuild, you draft and develop players. It is exactly what the Hornets have done. You don’t bring in vets to eat up all of their minutes and/or trade your young players away.
Let the young guys play so they can get better.@Viral_Marc @nyknicks @RjBarrett6 No, I never said we should lose. 
There is only 1 winner in this league. Everyone else is a loser. 
Guys like Fournier, Kemba, Burks, Noel are not going to win you a championship. 
What they will do is waste about 3 years that you could have spent developing players &amp; then retireSome really great value picks today.

https://t.co/W95yF78w9h@nyknicks you really should rethink the phrasing here.
@nba https://t.co/yaQ4cGVHJl@NBA_NewYork I would trade for either Brunson or Fox instead. Here's why: if the Knicks are gonna get back to the playoffs this year or next then they need a PG.

 #Brooklyn_Nets@rahmmagick @NYPost_Berman @boxand21 @nyknicks After February and March this team could very well be in the running for a top 5 pick. I’m not trading that for Turner. Maybe trade the Dallas pick but with his injury I wouldn’t even trade that. Best I could do is Obi for Turner straight up.Honored to be on the Board of Advisors at @EMNRSchoolNYC &amp; happy to report this new charter school &amp; it's students are excelling -- just like the school's namesake, Legacy Trustee &amp; my all-time favorite @nyknicks  @RealEarlMonroe did as a pro.

We bringing everybody back! Snag Spree and Reed too!@rahmmagick @NYPost_Berman @boxand21 @nyknicks I understood the point, I just think this regime is very careful about giving out #1 picks &amp; they wouldn’t pay Robinson while also paying Turner next year. Honestly, I wanted Turner, but Robinson is coming around so maybe we should go after a PG like Brunson instead?Will the #Knicks bounce back tonight at MSG against the #Timberwolves?

One day he will get to go to MSG and see @nyknicks play live. #RJBarrett #JuliusRandle https://t.co/TnZd16zrCO@DeadLaced @nyknicks my thoughts on why
1) still trying to compete
2) jericho sims isn’t ready
maybe next year, they’ll get minutes but for now i’d rather play Taj over Sims. Idk why McBride doesn’t play over Fournier or Burks tho.@nyknicks Trade Quickley or Rose to Cle so they get win the ship, don't waste there future on this hot messFire Tom @nyknicks you know what to do@LFCEoin_ @nyknicks i wish that would happen@nyknicks Too bad anytime Obi makes a mistake Thibs runs to Randle like he’s the GOAT of basketball@nyknicks Make it happen. https://t.co/8onIQIBSas@CharlesDiloren6 @nyknicks They’re away games .. on the west coast .. doubt the Knicks had any say in the matter@nyknicks “They gon keep playing Taj and the rest of the seniors”
