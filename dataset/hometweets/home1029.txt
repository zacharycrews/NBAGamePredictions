#ttrpg @TheOnyxPath #streaming https://t.co/giUN7wOqjPWhat issues do you think have to be fixed before the post season for the Miami Heat? 

Head over to our IG and let us know what you think 

https://t.co/EgHVWup2AJ@PrizePicks My choice would be 
1. Kyrie Irving - he OWNS road games, needs to produce for a #Nets win. Him and KD should dominate early in this game.
2. Jimmy Butler - should be an all-around good game for the Miami Heat, looking to secure spot in playoffs. (C. Cunningham questionable)Boston to Miami, Starting my vacation right in Miami by attending the @MiamiHEAT game tonight ! #HEATCultureDetroit Pistons match up against East-leading Miami Heat tonight in South Beach, and will have reinforcements in the lineup. 

However, Cade Cunningham is questionable.
