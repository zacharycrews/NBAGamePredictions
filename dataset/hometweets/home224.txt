I’m wrong often🤷🏼‍♂️@malika_andrews I'm very disappointed today tht u guys didn't mention Heat player Butler stats on 11/17 31/10/10. Herro not on top plays with the lob to Butler from the other end of the court but went in. Show Miami Heat love 😘😘Love watching you,keep it up!Bonus:

Yes miami had injuries but if olynyk wasnt on for spacing AD was rotating on every drive taking away the rim, my personal FMVP(for whatever thats worth😂). Also he LITERALLY did not miss a middy that offs.

#BarnardYearOfScience https://t.co/4P19wwyhSw@cclark_13 Miami was the most dispiriting loss of the season (thus far). Heat opened with high-pressure D; Pels made corner 3s and took a lead; Heat adjusted; and that was the game.
Ingram was doubled every time; Butler almost never doubled.
Pels went to small-ball lineup way too late.

Pels with another ugly loss to fall to 2-14 this season. They were held to 39.6 percent shooting over the final 3 quarters and were completely dominated in the 2nd half by a Miami team w/ no Bam/Lowry@LopezMalaqias @MiamiHEAT I’m the past 20 years we have 3 championships 😳Final Thoughts: Miami overcame a rough start against New Orleans and managed to dig deep to pull out a big win. With Kyle Lowry and Bam Adebayo sitting out to rest and injury respectively, the Heat would have to rely on not just Jimmy Butler, but also their core bench.Jimmy with a triple double

@MiamiHEAT | #HEATCulture https://t.co/3ZMAb1dzYmThanks for coming out @MiamiHEAT@MiamiHEAT @betwayusa HERRO NEED TO STOP WITH THE DAMN TURNOVERS.@MiamiHEAT @betwayusa Bro what the fuck. We are playing a TWO WIN TEAM. Get your shit together.@MiamiHEAT @betwayusa What's goin on..@diorreditz_ @MiamiHEAT @betwayusa the whole team fault as a whole.. poor defense, ugly turn overs, jimmy missing easy lay ups etc@MiamiHEAT @betwayusa Games like this make me realize how important Bam is…Miami's first quarter ...

- first 1st quarter where Miami never led this season
- 15-point deficit was largest faced by Heat in the first quarter this season (previous, 11 at Dallas)
- 13-point deficit is largest by after one quarter for Heat this season (previous, 6 at Dallas).@theheatOWNyou @sportsfanatic39 @MiamiHEAT @betwayusa Well that’s why lowery is starting. Herro does great coming off the bench. Just not good starting.@MiamiHEAT @betwayusa The heat thought they had this in the bag. Pelicans want it more and they’ll probably get it. We also desperately need a true backup PG.@MiamiHEAT @betwayusa If the heat lose it doesn’t count cause Lowry and bam aren’t playing imo@MiamiHeat_LATAM Muchas gracias crack!!@MiamiHEAT @betwayusa Need a Jimmy Butler appreciation tweet, admin 😊@MiamiHEAT @betwayusa COME ON HEAT THIS TEAM IS 2-13   THE WORST TEAM ALWAYS PLAY HARDER THAT THE HEAT.
