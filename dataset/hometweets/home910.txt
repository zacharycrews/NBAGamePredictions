Thought about it for zero seconds.I might just go back to supporting Houston Rocket next season cause this team is unserious by the way.@WestGoat @Claxstan @TheNBACentral If he was a #1 Seed the Lakers offense would cater to Russell Westbrook. 😂😂😂 Even as the #2 Scoring Option, Houston Rockets traded 6’10 shot-blocker Clint Capela specifically for Westbrook’s driving lanes. #3 option doesn’t fit Westbrook@TodayInSports3 Also the 1994-1995 Houston Rockets! 🏀
