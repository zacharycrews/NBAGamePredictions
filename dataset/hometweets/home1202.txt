We’ve always spent time at Detroit sports games over the years so it would be awesome to take him to a game!@Jefftuttle @DetroitPistons @FrediThePizzamn Thank u@DetroitPistons @tigers @alexis_of_313 @ausomecity313  let’s win@grind_stat3 Dude if the Detroit pistons trade for Russ I’m done being a fan, mostly because I’m putting a gun in my mouth 😂😂@RedAlternates If the Pistons throw max money at Zach he might consider the Pistons. Cade Cunningham is a player people want to play with. If they land the number 1 or 2 pick &amp; grab another top rookie, he might like it. Detroit is on the cusp of greatness!@DetroitPistons @tigers @BunnyBear47 you can go to games this year!Future piston using the Detroit lingo already, you wont be sick anymore when you and Cade winning chips https://t.co/hucLIhwDDdCome on @DetroitPistons u know #1fans support all detroit teams https://t.co/8lsiGp9BCSI know my piston’s fans on my TL like nahhhh this young core will b just fine 😂😂 but seriously if I’m Detroit, Houston and Charlotte hell no lol https://t.co/ORJ5BHqs5t@DetroitPistons @tigers @Joe_Larsen18 lets go@Jeremiah151738 @merlin7dsins @DetroitPistons Why?
