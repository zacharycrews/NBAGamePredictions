Staying in Sac-town, Richaun Holmes is ranked 33rd per game even though he played just 17 minutes in one of his two games due to foul trouble

With Marvin Bagley out of the rotation, expect more boom games from Holmes (if he stays out of foul trouble)Sacramento Kings

Umm, can we talk about Harrison Barnes for a second?

The Kings are running a tight 7 or 8-man rotation, and Barnes is averaging 37 mpg

He’s ranked 14th as a result of putting up a line of 31/12/2 with 1.5 steals and just 1.5 TOs per game

He looks like a stealDay 10 of tweeting @SacramentoKings that Richaun is the GOAT until they fb.At least @warriors  Vs @SacramentoKings  is at 9 pm. 😌

In conclusion, the Utah Jazz are the best.

DM me if interested@vs8fnn6d893 @statmuse @Mike_Schmitz @hoopculture13 @SacramentoKings I asked for the Dame stat line but ok. Still impressive defender either way. I expected it to be good, I watched the game... I just feel like an account called statmuse would give the real numbers instead of making it seem like something it’s not@aknight292 @statmuse @hoopculture13 @SacramentoKings Haters man….that’s not the point of this stat. Yeah he got the win and 27pts but many of those points were where Davion  wasn’t the primary defender. Davion as a rookie made an all nba player wildly inefficient and have to work for each bucketGolden Eagle Baccarat Strategy
