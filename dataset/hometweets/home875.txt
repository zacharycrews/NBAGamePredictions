He joined TNT's Inside the NBA team shortly therea https://t.co/HphulxXYei@EKMensah5 @NBA @Suns So what do you have to say about you beating GSW with same team?In Summary, @Suns are really good team. We are just waiting to see if it turns into Great championship Team. Is it fair to the Suns? No but thats how these things are. Almost all great teams have to go through this challenge.Do @Suns really have a superstar who can take on the best player from other team. Depth unfortunately can take you to certain levels but after some point it turns into 1vs1 game. Can Ayton/Bridges go to higher level?We are still waiting for answer(8/n)Who would win: the Memphis Grizzlies with Ja Morant or the Phoenix Suns with Joel Embiid? #ValleyProud #GrindCityNow lets talk about last year playoffs. @Suns were dominant in most series. The concern was that every time other team superstar took control suns struggled. AD from 1-0 to 1-2, PG almost made it 2-1 from 0-1 and of course Giannis in Finals. Can Suns really turn the momentum(7/n)🏀GAME DAY🏀 🏠

Other Contenders are going through these issues(4/n)@NBAonTNT @Suns They lost last week. How is that 16 straight@Suns So Lets start with the current season. @Suns are 1-2 vs @warriors , 1-1 vs @memgrizz , 0-1 vs @MiamiHEAT , 1-0 vs @Bucks @chicagobulls @sixers. Warriors and Heat losses were really bad. Grizz loss was close. Close win vs Bulls. The one really impressive win is vs Bucks(2/n)@femaleatlhawk That is why young teams need at least one solid vet with leadership skills on the team to school the young guy's as Golden State, Miami, and the Phoenix Suns, do for example.VIDEO: Highlights NBA, Phoenix Suns Atasi Perlawanan LA Clippers 103-96 https://t.co/y5TnbynOppPhoenix Suns' latest win in clutch comes through defense vs. Clippers – NBA News https://t.co/BxZZzSDgla@Neroli_Meadows @Suns Photo with @DevinBook would have been massive.@puntereinstien @Suns You’re a lakers fan lmfaoSuns look to keep ascending against reeling Rockets https://t.co/1rC9oLneIB #NBA #HoustonRockets #PhoenixSuns@Suns @mikal_bridges DA face 😂The @Suns are a great regular season team https://t.co/gkGCJDXkzpOrlando Magic - Atlanta Hawks

Why booker does a turnover

Cause they were gonna cover -7.5 first half

Its fucken rigged and i'll expose this garbage sport 

@NBA @SUNS @LAClippers@Suns *ahem* .. https://t.co/rlbDHBh0OiPhoenix takes a 53-47 halftime lead, though it is a major accomplishment for Clippers that the lead never reached double digits with Suns shooting 53.5% FGs. 

Booker with 13 points, all in 1st quarter. Ayton started making up for bad 1st quarter with 8 points, 7 rebounds in 2nd.When they came to #Detroit the @Suns won by 24 Points.@Suns have the lead at the break, 53-47 🍿 https://t.co/I99UHEBB86One half in the books. https://t.co/sy0N3wcqeSPhoenix Suns and the OVERR https://t.co/qOtgxTjeleNBA fans. Does anyone know why the @Suns play the “USB connected” sound on made free throws?Suns lead the Clippers at the break 53-47.

LA is getting hustle points, grinding for extra possessions (8 OREBS) and hitting tough shots. But Phoenix's highly efficient offense has them up now, shooting better by 13.5%.

Booker: 13 PTS, 6-8 FGs
Paul: 6/7/2
Ayton: 8 PTS, 8 REBSJust like how Devin Booker (Phoenix Suns) can be easily double-teamed, or how Giannis Antetekounmpo (Bucks) takes too long on his free throws.I love the @Suns but sometimes I can’t stand the bitch as moves of cp3 and Booker sometimes. I understand the strategy is getting the foul, you can’t depend on any Ref to give you the call,  let the playing do the talking... we’re that good, don’t need the acting.A classic drive and dime to DA. 💁‍♂️ https://t.co/O4259WT4ab@Suns Marcus Morris clearly learned this push off bs from Paul George.@Suns @JaValeMcGee I'm so happy the Suns are on TNT I finally get to see a game.
