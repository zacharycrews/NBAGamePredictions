Playoff Rondo is real. I hope he helps bring the Cavs out the east. They now have two players I adore. 😂💯 https://t.co/cf2b8WY9g4@JohnTelich8 @cavs Welcome to CLE!@cavs @RajonRondo So excited!!!!! Welcome Rajon ❤️@CavsJMike @cavs He a Cav player now@SethMainwaring @wasted_voter @clevelandfan49 @cavs @RajonRondo Rubio had a fg % of 36.3% and 3pt% of 32.9. Both well below NBA norms, but within the normal for Rubio. One of the reasons Rubio has moved around so much is his poor shooting. The Cavs didn’t care so it worked here because they wanted Spanish Ricky. Most teams don’t.@Walker_Kinon023 @cavs @denzelvalentine How many f****** teams you *root" for? 😑@cavs @kevinlove Fall in LoveThat’s 2021-2022 NBA 6th Man of the Year @kevinlove to you. @cavs #LetEmKnow https://t.co/oCwmCMrWiD@cavs @RajonRondo Rooting for you champ @RajonRondo@vinodiese1 @BrowBronBrodie @cavs @RajonRondo Silly 🙃Sources close to the Golden State Warriors say after a two-year hiatus, Klay Thompson is expected to play with the team in their game against the Cleveland Cavaliers Sunday.

I also like the Cleveland Cavaliers. LeBron James won me a big bet one time winning the championships; There's been a lot of chaos, and I actually can't remember what team he was on at the time. But he dominated so it hardly mattered. https://t.co/uh7xkcpvWq
