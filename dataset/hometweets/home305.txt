#LEGENDoftheMiamiHEAT #NBA75 https://t.co/6JS3aJCjU8@MiamiHEAT Herro out again with body soreness❓really 🙄 let's get on the floor dude 👈 total nonsense 👈And here's a really odd stat on the eve of Heat-Nuggets, with credit to the Nuggets traveling media for bringing this to our attention.

Current temperatures, as I type this, on November 29, 2021 at 6:22pm Eastern:

Denver, 68
Miami, 67Michael Malone, on the Jokic brothers here tonight for Heat-Nuggets II: "When the schedule comes out, who doesn't come to Miami? You're not going to Memphis. No disrespect to Memphis or any other city, but Miami is a great city to watch your brother play."

The full Malone quote: https://t.co/4w8XriS3GDMichael Malone on emotion of Heat vs Jokić: Much has been made of Jokić brothers coming to Miami. Irresponsible in my opinion because they've come to Miami every year. They're not coming down here to start something or cause trouble, just to support their brother. https://t.co/QtrsrmAEyxKeys to the game
Nuggets vs Heat

🔑 Paint - Nuggets dominated this last time in Denver
🔑 Poise - what’s past is past
🔑 Defend without fouling - can’t afford to be in foul trouble with all the injuries and Miami leads the league in made FT/game

•Main player of the team (like his Houston days)

•Can shoot 30 every game (like his Houston days)

•Atleast 7 assists to Bam (every game)

•No hate from Heat fans when he plays bad (like his houston days)the greatest gift the nba could give me today was having the nuggets and heat face each other in miami. hope these niggas is chippy from jumppppp tonight.@murdamonkk @RealGM They don’t call him OG for nothing look up some of the story behind dolphin players getting rob and heat players being left alone and UD has the keys to the city and he is the gate keeper.

Heat Nuggets rematch tonight in Miami.

Revenge? https://t.co/f3peEYcCKMTwo of the top teams in the league and of course the Miami Heat took care of business.

I go through the Gabe Vincent's heroic 4th quarter, Kyle Lowry doing Kyle Lowry things, and how the defensive scheme limited the stars but also had its downsides. #nba

https://t.co/Bjl2XBK4McThe Miami Heat defeat one of the best teams in the league, the Chicago Bulls. All it took was the Gabe Vincent show in the 4th quarter, Kyle Lowry making tough shots, and a great defensive scheme to limit the stars. #NBATwitter #HeatTwitter #SimplyBallin

https://t.co/uUQz2jD0Tl@Christo75028704 @fishsports I am also wondering the mechanics of how there would be a bidding war between the Mavs/Heat for Dragic.

Here is the CBAFAQ wording for this. Only way he can go back to Miami is if he’s traded somewhere else and then separately that team buys out Dragic or trades him to Miami. https://t.co/AkauyviTHYMIAMI HEAT LEBRON IS HERE YA’LL 😤💪🏻Garrett is a true specimen.. when I saw him sit in front of me at the heat game in miami I could believe he was real.. also couldn’t see shit the rest of the game@CourtneyFallon_ @TheJaxShow @MiamiHEAT That's a pretty cool shirt!Check out the latest episode of @FiveOnTheFloor5 on the #MiamiHeat and #NBA https://t.co/pZc3CafmeE on #Podbean@WadexFlash @MiamiHEAT @raf_tyler @JimmyButler Bucks once@HardRockStadium @MiamiHEAT @Bam1of1 @MiamiDolphins It’s obvious now why @MiamiDolphins dominated this game.@JohnWall might else well get that buy out and come to @MiamiHEAT@chicagobulls Thanks to the Heat win, we getting 50% off pizza and free beef tacos in Miami!
