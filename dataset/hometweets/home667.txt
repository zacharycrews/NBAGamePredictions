San Antonio Spurs@spurs @BrynjForbes Bryn didn‚Äôt need to return to the Spurs squad after the team already had sooo many guards. He wants playing time but San Antonio was never gonna be the place. Thankful for the games he did take over to help win but his lack on defense hurt the squad more than help. Good luck Bryn@spurs @BrynjForbes I always wondered why Bryn didn't get his #11 back when he re-signed with San Antonio and gave it to Josh Primo instead.  I guess that doesn't matter now.
