His ppg is 17.5 , we've this high line due to Chicago's absences but I consider it too high cuz he has a bad matchup against Embiid tonight. On h2h he only got 6 and 11 points. He should take a few more shots tonight but still good bet https://t.co/WJiUkZVYY3If the #Bulls come away from the trade deadline with Poeltl and Schroder while only giving up pieces like TBJ, Coby, and picks, that's amazing.

Bulls are back in Chicago to face the 76ers.

This is a game I‚Äôve been dreading. I think they‚Äôre a terrible matchup for us and I fear what Joel Embiid could do to us!

I really hope we can find a way to win and make Billy Donovan an All Star coach.
