Boston is likely to only dress 8 guys tonight with the newly acquired trade pieces not ready yet. PP is the only guard on the bench. If Smart/Brown get into foul trouble or this game blows out he could see 25+ min

Schroeder was a 1 year rental and Theis was excellent for the Celtics before getting traded. I like Derrick Whites fit a lot; he’s young, plays hard and is an excellent defender. Plus he will get more open looks in Boston and knock them down.@celtics Never in my life have I watched Daniel Theis highlights, but here we are.@sccav_ @celtics I’m hoping it works. I know they been winning but it’s depressing to watch sometimes@gummyworm2345 @celtics @BrunoFernandoMV @EnesFreedom No defense played by him whatsoever and he’s 6’11@CleanSocks4 @celtics You clearly haven’t been watching the Celtics over the past 10-15 games…@dtheis10 @celtics A Daniel Theis hype video seriously???

Ojeleye set the Kansas boys basketball career scoring record at Ottawa High School before playing at Duke and SMU. @semi #KSbasketballhistory https://t.co/Cwhny7bxbLOn this date in 1952, Boston Celtics legend, Mr. Basketball, Bob Cousy led all players with 13 assists in the NBA All Star Game. https://t.co/IMPFLHyBGqHey @celtics , do the “we just signed IT tweet” @isaiahthomas #kinginthefourthThe @Celtics have to fill spots. Some guys I’d kick the tires on - Willie Cauley Stein - Meyers Leonard (that man has paid his dues) - Jabari Parker - Tacko Fall - Harry Giles - Irsan Ilyasova - Luke Kornet. Good role playing guys.@celtics @BrunoFernandoMV @EnesFreedom Wouldn't be surprised if Enes is back since he got bought out by Rockets already@BigDeuceSZN @celtics @J_Rich1 @yeahyeah22 Why you do that😂@allenbr95938408 @celtics DS destroys the flow of the game every time he’s in.

It is such an accomplishment for Mr White is on this legendary Celtics Team...sooo awesome! 💚💚💚@celtics why do you continue to get rid of talent. I have seen over the past year a team go backward instead of forward just ridiculous. Josh Richardson has been of your best players this year and you get rid of him for nothing. My patience as a fan is really wearing thin.@HeyyitsJayybee @BSRantsblog @celtics Langford didn't work because he's in Brown/Tatum's class stuffed into role player. He was huge in two of team's biggest wins this season: 11/4 when they held MIA to 78 points; 12/31 when they beat Suns.... 2-3 more FG's/game (which is reps&gt;talent) and entire Romeo convo changes.@tatumszn_0 @celtics @Dwhite921 i don’t know the problem with dennis, he didn’t fit the system but he’s obviously a starting calibre pg in the league and he did his best. he stepped up big when he had to, why the hate everywhere@celtics Jesus Theis has resurrectedLast night the San Antonio Spurs have traded one of my favorite players. Derrick White was sent to the Boston Celtics in exchange for Josh Richardson and Romeo Langford alongside with a 2022 first-round pick. Josh 6'6" and 6'8"wingspan, he is longest than Derrick. #NBA #PorVidaGood morning @celtics nation, just a friendly reminder that Derrick White plays basketball today (hopefully)@HeyyitsJayybee @BSRantsblog @celtics You're assuming a Spurs system player will flourish on C's because of a false perception that the C's are the Spurs. For the body of 2 years this has been one of most underachieving teams in sports.@celtics @Dwhite921 Damn 😪@celtics Daniel Theis has been acquired by the Boston Celtics

For someone who talks about fucking other people’s wives, I hope you aren’t using that emotional defense when you talk to women@Celticspain17 @WillyDiBa7 @celtics @Dwhite921 from what i’ve seen from spurs fans, white played better when murray was injured and he took over at pg, but i think we will be able to run smart and white together. if not, he’ll be great for running the bench or maybe playing limited minutes together with smart@celtics @J_Rich1 @yeahyeah22 Good luck Romeo, i felt like he was just getting confident in his game, wish it was NeSmith 😖@celtics @Dwhite921 Welcome Derrick we are very excitedGood luck in Boston, @Dwhite921!

If Cs get past KD Netz, I think we’ll get a 7 game nba finals https://t.co/Xw9iHXWzs4Better late than never! Am I right?! 

Here’s to you and your next journey with the Boston Celtics! Miss you so much already. Please don’t forget us little people in Memphis, (little people being me). 🤣

Congratulations on your well-deserved promotion, pal! @Sydney_Cheever https://t.co/2xPuwBqhXB@BostonCeltics_7 @DaBirdizDaWord @FDSportsbook Wrong … wolves won on Tuesday not yesterday@celtics Loved JoJo listening to the Cs on the radio growing up.  Not as much as I loved Cornbread later on and hated Bernard King.  😂It appears the @Celtics have their 8 man rotation in place so with 5 open spots they need to go after specialists and veterans. @isaiahthomas fits the bill!@MrBeastBurner1 @celtics Lol JoJo coming back in a time machine!!
