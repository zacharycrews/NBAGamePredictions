It is also understandable that Knicks fans did not have a clue that Cam Reddish was on day-to-day protocols when he was traded to the Knicks.

{ Expect the average Knicks fan to follow the Hawks? }

Also do we expect Thibs to be urgent to integrate young players to his team.NBA play:🏀✨

1️⃣Knicks -3.5 (-110)

-New Orleans are 0-5 SU in their last 5 games on the road.

-New York are 6-1 ATS in their last 7 games at home. 

-Knicks have lost 2 straight home games, they are due for a win https://t.co/gPu9yXTulW@drmaryeb @TheyLoveMyEther @femaleatlhawk @RealVoiceofHawk @bloghawk @RevInTampa @BobRathbunTV @nyknicks Cam Reddish injured his ankle 3 minutes into the Clippers game on January 9th. The game recap noted that "it's the same ankle he previously injured."

Hawks traded him to the Knicks on January 13th.

It is understandable that Cam Reddish is eager to get back on the court.

Thibs is not the coach for us with all of this young talent we have! He wants to use the same damn rotation and rather play Randle at the 5 yesterday than Sims, and look what happened! Thibs has got to go already.@Jaymartinez1013 @nyknicks That but it was more because he had 7 turnovers@FreezeTAGFilms @nyknicks @NY_KnicksPR He doesn’t know what he’s doing fam lolAs a lifelong Heat fan and hater of the New York Knicks, I can say I’ve never been more ready for a book. Thanks @Herring_NBA  #InRileyWeTrust https://t.co/3RmGMYsiZ2We are running out of time to win the big one @nyknicks and @psufootball https://t.co/U4L3sewjWb@quietknicksfan @_dragondad @wcknicks @nyknicks @deucemcb11 Ya know?!!!@wcknicks @nyknicks @deucemcb11 These two brothers should be playing on the Knicks but again Tib doesn’t understand young talent@nyknicks At this rate, I'd like Obi traded just so all of his overly infatuated fans can follow him and stop blaming thibs for Obi's early development woes. Free Obi!....to anywhere but here lmao@ImSleepyC @KnicksFanTv @CPTheFanchise @nyknicks @alanhahn @wallyball @WaltFrazier I see myself with the hair I look so focused! 🤣@adoptolderkids @TheGarden @nyknicks @NBA Always happy to have YGB families at the game! 💙🌟This was taken last year, wearing my New York Knicks gear, Patrick Ewing jersey! https://t.co/t4md5SipZD@NYMSean @nyknicks Bingo. They'd be stars with good motors@draftniks @nyknicks they’re similar players in that is it just me or do both seem to have a low motor. Like if they both were motivated to dominate they could@NBA_NewYork Knicks better win by 50 points next game from make up calls. Got that ref!!@quietknicksfan @wcknicks @nyknicks @deucemcb11 Thibs hates the kids@DanielAug6 @wcknicks @nyknicks @deucemcb11 He absolutely should get quality minutes his physique and freakish athleticism is a cheat code.@alanhahn I wonder if it could be trade baiting to see if other teams like the @nyknicks would get desperate and part with more than they should. Hold fast everyone. Keep making the calls but stay cool, stay the course.Please go get Mo @nyknicks. Trade Mitch. https://t.co/vc5SwdNO0LWill get me a Zion jersey if he comes @nyknicks@nyknicks @BetMGM Let’s go Knicks!@StateNYKPOD  you got it bro ..
