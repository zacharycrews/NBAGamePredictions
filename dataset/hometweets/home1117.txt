Tomorrow is going to be the biggest day in NBA basketball for new orleans since we had rondo and boogie.New Orleans Pelicans called a timeout with :00.1 down by 4 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣Loss by the Pelicans today moves the Clippers back to four up in the loss column on New Orleans for 8th, and it puts the Clippers' magic number with the Pelicans at four.Final: Spurs 107, Pelicans 103

Devonte' Graham went 2 for 10, Herb Jones 2 for 11.

Jose Alvarado had 23 points and 5 assists off the bench.

New Orleans' lead over San Antonio shrinks to 1 game. It loses the head-to-head tiebreaker.Jose Alvarado misses go-ahead 3 &amp; the Spurs get a quick fastbreak bucket on other end. Pelicans made a game of it in final minute, but this undoubtedly goes down as a disappointing 107-103 loss. San Antonio sits a game in back of 10th seeded New Orleans + they own the tiebreaker.Hat-trick of wins for the @spurs today. Not only do they gain a game on the Pelicans, they win the tiebreaker 3-1 vs. New Orleans which essentially gives than an extra half game, and they’ll get another half game closer to the loser of Lakers vs. Pelicans tomorrow. #PorVidaMassive win for the Spurs over the Pelicans, who now move a game within New Orleans for the No. 10 seed in the west.

#NBA75They are neck and neck with the New Orleans Pelicans, who are without their best player.

The play in isn’t worth it.The New Orleans Pelicans have tied a season-high with 10 blocks today, per NOP BroadcastSpurs-Pelicans has been really fun. Jose Alvarado is going off for New Orleans. Pretty big game in the Play-In Pillow Fight in the West!I'm telling you man and I will always say it, for some reason referees absolutely hate new orleans based teams. Whether it be nfl or nba the refs seem to have it out for new orleans and im sick of it. #Nola #pelicans #saints #nbaJose Alvarado is carrying the Pelicans offense now. He's up to 18 points on 13 shots and his And-1 free throw gives New Orleans a 92-90 lead with 8:45 left in regulation.@SouthernULaw King of the Court tournament.
