*However I saw a fan call Jason Kidd, “Jason Old” at the end of his playing career at a @cavs game I had floor seats for. Jason flipped out, had to be held back, and it was f*cking HILARIOUS!@root4browns @BuckeyeJC714 @cavs @Lakers Vivid seats. 73.00 each plus fees. Not bad…@root4browns @cavs @Lakers My first game since before Covid- I’m excited to get back in the building@BuckeyeJC714 @cavs @Lakers I thought about it until I saw the ticket prices.@ChrisFedor great job in writing about @cavs @cavsdan @PDcavsinsider @MrCavalier34Anyone going to the @cavs @Lakers game tomorrow night?!@gabbgoudy @CLESports @BallySportsCLE @Flash_Garrett @Browns @dariusgarland22 @cavs @MrLapara @CleGuardians I went with Myles.  He is such a game changer, not sure where the defense would have been without him last year🤷@CLESports @BallySportsCLE @Flash_Garrett @Browns @dariusgarland22 @cavs @MrLapara @CleGuardians this is such a tough poll. one won a playoff game. one has been the best player at his position. and the other is now the most improved player in his league.Darius Garland jersey just shipped out! 😈💪🏽🚀 @cavs #Cavs@UniqueSteezz @Muted_FIN @Ronnie2K @NBA2K @cavs @dariusgarland22 I only played current because of my friends but 2k lost me because of this they didn’t even communicate with us and everyone was wondering if it was coming back@SliderTheMascot @cavs @CleGuardians But did you dunk, bro? 🤷🏽‍♀️One of my favorite
@Cavs teams EVER! 🔥

Reread pumpkin, not on him, but go ahead and be offended. https://t.co/yG7vI8SKlUIf the @Browns go to the Superbowl, 95% of America will be rooting against them, and if they win, everyone will hate Cleveland.

Our city may finally get its championship, but this isn't how anyone wanted it.

At least we'll always have the @cavs@Fog_Raww @cavs @NBA2K @dariusgarland22 I'm happy for the kid, just a wasted opportunity, for the team, DG, and a real fan.@kayceegaming818 @Muted_FIN @Ronnie2K @NBA2K @cavs @dariusgarland22 I’m saying bro but when it happens on next gen they fixing with them a minute@shadesix1 @jimmylongojr @kevinlove @cavs Should've been in the dunk contest.Izaiah Brockington says "seeing [Lamar Stevens] do two-a-days, how he took care of his body...and seeing him be a leader...was really big [for his career]."

The @cavs forward and @CycloneMBB star were teammates at @PennStateMBB.

@Flash_Garrett @Browns @dariusgarland22 @cavs @MrLapara @CleGuardiansThe #Nuggets (+2.5) fought the good fight in their overtime game against the Cleveland Cavaliers this past Friday but wound up with a less-than-desirable result...

Let's see what happens tonight when they go out against the #Celtics 🟢🏀⚪

#MileHighBasketball | #BleedGreen https://t.co/xzH1GVezXm@Fog_Raww @cavs @NBA2K @dariusgarland22 More of a comment on who put it together, u don't think it was awkward AF for DG when he didn't know him? I would put the blame on the producer of the clip, it would have taken 0 effort to find a real cavs fan who would have shown it. Sorry to offend you there pumpkin.@adqmokc @SportsSpicer @dillybar2145 @OhioStateHoops @cavs You’re looking at some bad mock drafts@mcfaddenpick6 @cavs @NBA2K @dariusgarland22 Yeah lets shit on this 12 year old@Detroit_Stan14 @Steezyy7k @DetroitPistons @cavs I think cade is an outstanding young player but i still take mobley to play with allen and garland.@LeVertsGoat @Steezyy7k @DetroitPistons @cavs Could’ve been a fit thing tbh@Detroit_Stan14 @Steezyy7k @DetroitPistons @cavs i mean look at us now@ChristinaKay @dtCLEresidents @cavs Yes ma’am@dtCLEresidents The @cavs game tomorrow!!! #LetEmKnow@Johnjoh15685768 @Steezyy7k @DetroitPistons @cavs Arguing with someone that’s probably the same age as your children is pretty depressing, I’d be disappointed in myself too 🤦🏾‍♂️@__LaFlamaBlanca @cavs Ope.
