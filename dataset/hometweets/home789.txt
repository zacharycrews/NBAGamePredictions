Before the game last night the Mavs had lost two in a row… to the Orlando Magic &amp; OKC Thunder…

Hopefully February gets better for Philly… @DSM_Media@NBAspain @OrlandoMagic Penny Hardaway@BrianByrdman @roundballrock22 @mvogts @OrlandoMagic Suggs wasn't even the most NBA-ready rookie in his own team@sabreenajm Even the orlando magic is better than the whole WNBA@NBAspain @OrlandoMagic Mc GradyBack at it tonight at home against the talented young Memphis Grizzlies. Ja Morant is questionable to play. 

Can the Magic continue their improved play and surprise the Grizzlies tonight?

If there is any soreness, then rest is needed. If not, then rest is still needed. Either way, his health is top priority.@NBAspain @OrlandoMagic mcgrady@FoxNews But you have the right to infect whomever you want? Come on, that’s not freedom, that’s selfishness. 

But then again what do expect from a guy who told the Orlando Magic he was staying &amp; the very next morning announced he was leaving for LA. Selfish.After his jerseys were stolen from the visitor's locker room when the team was on the road against the Orlando Magic, Jordan had to wear a No. 12 jersey.

Clearly, nothing could stop him.

Let’s go green! ☘️@BallsackSports @Dame_Lillard That’s foolish bruh. You owe them no loyalty. They’ll trade you as soon as you stop producing… Slide to Florida and enjoy the diversity. @MiamiHEAT @OrlandoMagic@TOOTTHEBARBER He wouldn’t have many positive options of the teams with available cap space. The San Antonio Spurs ($41.9M), Detroit Pistons ($39.3M), Orlando Magic ($34.9M), Oklahoma City Thunder ($22.9M), and Memphis Grizzlies ($21.7M) are the only teams projected to have more than $21 mThe difference between this and @stoolpresidente shot at the @OrlandoMagic game? https://t.co/ePMfJluKtcTimTheTatMan is officially 1-10 over the last month. Even the @OrlandoMagic have a better winning percentage then that. Absolutely tragic. https://t.co/DUP04kNd2Etrade 4
