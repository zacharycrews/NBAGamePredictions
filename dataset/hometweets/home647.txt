Washington is now +20,000 to win the NBA Championship on the Parx Sportsbook app: https://t.co/G6vQEbivPJ https://t.co/pTfk7RDpzhJoel Embiid averaged 30 points, 9.7 rebounds, and 3.3 assists vs. the #Wizards last season. In Philadelphia's matchup against Washington this past December, he dropped 36 points and 13 rebounds. Safe to say Embiid will give Washington some problems today. 

#Sixers #HereTheyCome@FanAttic007 @LakersNation Lebron James didn't think Westbrook was garbage. 
Washington Wizards still owed Westbrook 91 million dollars and Lebron foolishly suggested the Lakers pick up that tab. https://t.co/IjCsk3y58OJoseph Blair will assume acting head coaching duties for the Washington Wizards, replacing Pat Delany as interim head coach.
