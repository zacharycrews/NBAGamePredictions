Do you players actually give a shit that your national team is sponsored by N√©stle? N√©stle earns blood money and this in turn goes into your pocket. As a Kosovar, you should know what nationalists are (Serbia). Nationalists support Putin.

After 60 games this year Chicago had a 39 and 21 record, but only have 6 wins since. It will be nice to have the United Center for something other than concerts, for at least two dates, in the spring of 2022.Love that the Bulls are going to avoid the play-in. The playoffs likely won‚Äôt last long as Chicago is 0 for the season against the top 3 teams. But that is OK. Progress.  And who knows, maybe we can pull off a playoff surprise. #BullsNation https://t.co/P3EPJ1H4pa@OrlandoMagic @chicagobulls I flew to Orlando to watch the Bulls game in January. YOU GUYS SPANKED US.
