-5.5-110
Risk $1.10  Win $1.00I don‚Äôt see a huge problem with the small ball lineup for the raptors with Siakams return. Vanvleet, Trent, OG, Barnes, Siakam. 
Not a huge difference from Lowry, Vanvleet, OG, Siakam, Powell/Ibaka.
I don‚Äôt see anyone besides precious getting benched. #torontoRaptors #siakamBrooklyn Nets
