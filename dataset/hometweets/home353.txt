The Memphis game was an embarrassment, but take that away and who’s the one actively trying to lose?@Bryan_10s @mattjhill71 @nategonzalez15 @NBATV @okcthunder @DetroitPistons THATS LITERALLY WHAT THE THUNDER HAVE BEEN DOING!!!

Almost EVERY GAME this season the Thunder have been competitive! Good lord man it was one game. The Pistons are tanking just like the Thunder, and have been for years. Quit being hypocritical man lolMake sure you get here early and catch some vibes at Power Hour with the Extreme Team! Doors open at 5:30.

Power Hour x @DiscountTire https://t.co/CFlRUGVM9i@lukemolet97 @mattjhill71 @nategonzalez15 @NBATV @okcthunder @DetroitPistons So we do have 3 championships hanging in the rafters but sure we've been bad recently.   We've never tanked.  Even last year we played hard night after night.  This is our first honest rebuild and we have your guy Troy Weaver doing it.  You guys started your rebuild earlier.@Bryan_10s @mattjhill71 @nategonzalez15 @NBATV @okcthunder @DetroitPistons So explain to me how the Pistons have been so bad for so long then?

This same Thunder “team” has been on a 4-game winning streak this season. They compete and play hard night-in and night-out. I agree that loss was pathetic, but the Thunder had 7 rotational players out.@lukemolet97 @mattjhill71 @nategonzalez15 @NBATV @okcthunder @DetroitPistons Losing by 73 is quitting and disrespecting the profession. It's screwing over the fans who bought tickets. I once respected the Thunder but tanking does not build a winning culture. It gathers talent for winning franchises who evaluate talent  properly no matter where they draft.@mattjhill71 @Bryan_10s @nategonzalez15 @NBATV @okcthunder @DetroitPistons A loss by 73 points = 1 loss in the W/L column. As much as it would benefit the Thunder to lose tonight (and I hope they do for the tank purposes), they likely are beating Detroit lol. 

Detroit gets the #1 overall pick and is still the worst in the league.VTG Nike Detroit Pistons Lindsey Hunter 1 Reversible Practice Worn Jersey 2XL +4 https://t.co/RZ1fBb3ak9 eBay https://t.co/ummD6pZQ11Along with that, I am just thinking of much Cade Cunningham and Killian Hayes would benefit learning from his. When Troy Weaver says “restore” the Pistons to who they were, “Mr. Big Shot” could echo those sentiments from someone who has done it in Detroit.I understand that he couldn’t turn down the opportunity to coach Dame/CJ in his first HC job, but I was just hoping that he would be available should the Detroit Pistons ever decide to move on from Dwane Casey. He fits the city and culture like a glove.NBA Betting Picks: Oklahoma City Thunder vs Detroit Pistons preview, picks and prediction https://t.co/JPGPS0kved🚨 New item of the game alert! 🚨

The two worst teams in the NBA going at it. This should be a good one. With the OKC getting blowing out by 73 points and Detroit barely losing to the hottest team in the NBA, I think the Pistons should get it done tonight💪🏼@ryantjansen Man city
