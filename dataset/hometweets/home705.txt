#NBAPicksThere can also be a giant 3-team deal with the Philadelphia 76ers regarding James Harden. This is a potential trade I think would shake the entire NBA. Unrealistic, sure. But since Harden will be moved, things like this are not out of possibility. https://t.co/NQwX690Q0qIf the Philadelphia #76ers are serious about landing James Harden, they should trade Ben Simmons and Tobias Harris to the Sacramento Kings.
