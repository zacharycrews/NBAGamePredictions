Blazers won 112-107 in their first meeting. One of the best wins for the Blazers this year.

I think we'll see @AnferneeSimons continue is great January play.@JayCCullen1 @DaHammy808 @MKBHD By definition yes

But it’s so glaringly obvious that to reduce it to the word ‘speculation’ suggests it’s not glaringly obvious. When it is.

[via r/chicagobulls Jan 30, 2019 #Bulls]@chicagobulls @ctsbulls @DeMar_DeRozan I hope you guys figured out how to fix our defense.
I mean we are suffering defensively and all of you are noticing that and no one is doing shit about it@MarkPar33238593 @ChiSportUpdates @chicagobulls The Bulls have a lot of trap games coming up sir. These are definitely games that won't be easy. And hopefully the Bulls won't play down to any of these teams. We need to still play like they wanna win every game. Even if it is gonna be tough. #BullsNation@chicagobulls @LiquiMolyUSA Do you guys have the right hat to give away with @BMOHarrisBank today?

I never knew until I left Chicago years later how much people hated the Bulls and MJ. I can't stand KC, probably because my Bears passed over Mahomes for Trubisky, and a guy I work with is an obnoxious KC fan. I shouldn't, really until you win more titles.

Let's keep building.

@LiquiMolyUSA | #BullsNation https://t.co/nZ3ep5C24QWhile working for the Nuggets, Karnisovas was regarded as instrumental to their draft success, including drafting Nikola Jokic, who was named NBA MVP in 2021.

He brought his knowledge, wisdom and international experience to Chicago. Bulls, you got a great one 🙌A lot of Bulls' resurgence has to do with Karnisovas. 

He was hired in April of 2021 and 4 months later Bulls signed Lonzo Ball, DeMar DeRozan and Alex Caruso. 

With Zach LaVine and Nikola Vucevic already aboard, @chicagobulls were suddenly a threat."When we hired Arturas, I was confident that he would help turn things around, but I can't say I thought it would be this quickly," Chicago Bulls president Michael Reinsdorf said 2 weeks ago.

Last year Chicago was not in the playoffs. Now they are 2nd in the Eastern conference.Imagine a guy, who had his background checked by the KGB, just so he could enroll at the university. 

Who took pictures of Dream Team while playing against them.

And also was the best European player.

Meet Arturas Karnisovas, executive VP of the Chicago Bulls.

LeBron is literally the GM of all his team.  I guess we'll have to agree to disagree here.  It's all opinion based anyway, and you are obviously entitled to yours.  Maybe I'm just biased cuz I grew up in Chicago during those Bulls runs.I can’t lie, but Ja Morant reminds me of a young crafty MVP Chicago Bulls Derrick Rose.

I follow this league very closely and knew they were good defensively but #1?!?! Wow@kirkgoldsberry @celtics @dallasmavs @Suns @MiamiHEAT @dmorey @Lakers @BrooklynNets @nyknicks @chicagobulls @warriors The Buffalo Sabers being a top 10 NBA offense. What the F is that logo surrounded by the Bucks Heat and Sixers? Is that the Sabers or Denver Nuggs logo? When did that travesty happen what is it?@Austin_Vols I was watching the Chicago Bulls the other day and we are running the exact same schemes they are...NBA is on all the time. Everywhere. ABC right now. Espn. TNT. Chicago nbc sports net for the bulls. Can’t miss it. College basketball too. Hockey is basically gone. Major failCHI Bulls are in a GREAT position just a few weeks out from the 2021-22 NBA All Star break and they have loads of great pieces, each w/ an important role. If they make a trade I’d say it should be Patrick Williams for Jerami Grant. I’d personally keep Williams #NBA #ChicagoBulls@positivity_won @shellyduarte10 @MeghanWalsh_ @CarmenStuder @NoWitnessUK @shepardout @TheEmmapreneur @SerenityRose292 @stellar_truth @SurvivorSing Juan flew into Chicago to meet me.  He seemed to want to hire me.  Pass.

4 hours of boredom drove me to drink 5 red bulls &amp; Vodkas, a ribeye steak &amp; most of a meat/cheese/fruit tray.  And Juan paid.  My boredom ain't free.@QueenieBee618 @chicagobulls 🤪👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽 fuck around and found out hun🤣😂I get why hockey doesn’t rate, but, the answer is 100% Wayne Gretzky. And this is coming from a black man who grew up in Chicago and whose formative sports years involved six NBA championships with the Bulls. Gretzky was better at hockey than any other athlete was at their sport. https://t.co/jJ4GBd3NRu@lgreverb Real Madrid, Sporting KC, Chicago Bulls, Duke (basketball)@chicagobulls @Stacey21King Happy Birthday @Stacey21King May all your dreams continue to come true.  BEEP BEEPThe team is playing hard tonight. Hoiberg will get this program in the right direction. The man coached the Chicago Bulls. Let’s give him time.You think the Bulls need to add at the deadline?

Hypothetical, (maybe a quality addition for the bulls🤔)do you think Portland would deal Nurkic?

Is Baynes or Boogie a FA?

What are your thoughts #chicagobulls #nba #tradedeadlineUp next for the short handed @chicagobulls , Portland , Orlando, Toronto and The Pacers. Only 1 man can save us …………. https://t.co/O2Ib4lynBcNew listing!

What do you think the outcome of the game will be?

This is the 1996 Chicago Bulls Roster that won 72 games… your telling me this a super team 🤣 … Lebron James simply is not a better player and the great difference is defense.
