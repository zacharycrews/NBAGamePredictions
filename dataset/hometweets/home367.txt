Bet slip link: https://t.co/Eb2ufo8ztA https://t.co/rzZJdmSVH1The 04 Pistons were good but Detroit act like they was the 92 USA team

Since they won the championship the only other championship teams they could’ve beat are The Bucks, The Raptors, and The (bubble) LakersNow that #KyleRittennhouse isn’t a @Lakers fan, rumor has it he’s backing the @DetroitPistons because he thought they were the Detroit Pistols. 

Personally, I think he should be a fan of the @OrlandoMagic , cause that’s what it took to be found not guilty.

@okcthunder@michaeldomps @KuKhahil Turner will be a great fit for the Pistons, they badly needed a rim protector and PnR partner for their young backcourt. I'd say use the draft for PF like Banchero, Jabari or Baldwin. Turner has the tools to be an All Star Center, maybe he just needs a new team like Detroit.@woodwardsports @DetroitPistons @CadeCunningham_ @NBAHistory Met expectations people saying mobley is better is kindve crazy I always thought it’s harder to be a guard then a big man and mobley also had nice compliments around him if Cade had nice compliments around him he would be averaging 8-9 assists per game
