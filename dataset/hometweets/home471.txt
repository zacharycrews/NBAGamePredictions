You surround Russ with shooting. And we have shooters. Russ has never been a shooter but he always gets his teams to the playoffs.. I’m just sayin..@nyknicks Game Day 🏀 Time to WIN WIN WIN WIN ⛹️⛹️⛹️⛹️⛹️⛹️⛹️⛹️ let's gooooooooo Knicks 🏀@DJTrakstar @FahimInsurance @rahmmagick @krispursiainen @boxand21 @nyknicks Yea…..but his shooting is just so awful.

We already have inconsistent shooting from Evan and RJ. Randle been off on his 3s. Mitch can’t shoot beyond 2 feet.

Would have most congested paint ever.

Russ just a waste of time imo and doesn’t make us much better.@nyknicks Seems like he got a court side job cominghttps://t.co/cZwmgsKaZF

Ooh ZHYT . . The way the @nyknicks play . . This (@swipathefox ) what they need but I think they will deal @drose  to the @Lakers BEKAUSE the @warriors are too stupid NOT to take him . . They tryna play him BEKAUSE he's GETTIN older . . He's STILL the man@KnicksBig15 @rahmmagick @FahimInsurance @krispursiainen @boxand21 @nyknicks Again please listen to my original point. We’re not acquiring him as a savior. He would only be here this yr and next. It would alleviate a glut at the guard position to give our young guys mins and his $50mil comes off the books next yr clearing tons of cap!.@DanuelHouseJr on signing with the Knicks: “It’s an unbelievable opportunity. Can’t wait to showcase my energy and play the right way and learn.” Said “it’s always an honor” to get another chance to play in the NBA. @nyknicks announced they signed Danuel to a 10-day contract.@KingJuliusOfNY @NY_KnicksPR @nyknicks Who the other@DJTrakstar @rahmmagick @FahimInsurance @krispursiainen @boxand21 @nyknicks (2/2) doesn’t make sense cuz Russ and Fox are similar players. So if I’m pointing out Russ faults, I wouldn’t be for Fox.

Anyway, as for Fox, he’s talented and all but I’m not crazy about him either.@DJTrakstar @rahmmagick @krispursiainen @boxand21 @nyknicks Westbrook? LA Westbrook? Westbrook who is underperforming playing along 3 HOF players? You smocking crack? https://t.co/XRIstFboe9@KnicksBig15 @DJTrakstar @rahmmagick @krispursiainen @boxand21 @nyknicks You just dislike Russ.

Not trying to hate on Russ because I respect him as a future hall of famer and as all-out attacker but just speaking the facts.

Also, Houston were better with Harden &amp; Chris Paul than with Russ.

Lastly, the Fox reference doesn’t@DJTrakstar @KnicksBig15 @rahmmagick @krispursiainen @boxand21 @nyknicks Did I say that? But Fox is way younger been in the league way less and didn't have KD and Harden to start with. I'm not comparing anyone just giving the younger player time.@m4mba824 @nyknicks @DanuelHouseJr He is a streaky, but when he’s on he’s really good.@nyknicks @DanuelHouseJr This is a good move for us@rahmmagick @KnicksBig15 @FahimInsurance @krispursiainen @boxand21 @nyknicks Agreed I was hoping that when he got cut.

Please name one thing.. and this is on a down track for Russ and he’s more efficient and pretty much better at everything basketball related.@FahimInsurance @rahmmagick @DJTrakstar @krispursiainen @boxand21 @nyknicks Don’t know who the ‘others’ are. I’ve seen a lot more say it’s Russ as the bad fit (again they won a chip with Lebron and AD before Russ ever got there).@DJTrakstar @rahmmagick @krispursiainen @boxand21 @nyknicks Is it just Knick fans tho?@nyknicks @DanuelHouseJr I'll take it actually@DJTrakstar @KnicksBig15 @rahmmagick @krispursiainen @boxand21 @nyknicks Fox is young and on The Kings. On a better team I think he is better too.@KnicksBig15 @rahmmagick @FahimInsurance @krispursiainen @boxand21 @nyknicks Every team he’s been on has won.. Lol He carried the wizards last yr in the second half. Just like he did with Houston and OKC before that. What more you want?

Washington had a issue winning with him last season too. He’s a great solo act and high energy player but his style is not best suited for todays game which emphasizes more perimeter shooting.@nyknicks @DanuelHouseJr Isn’t he hurt?@FahimInsurance @rahmmagick @DJTrakstar @krispursiainen @boxand21 @nyknicks They won a championship with AD. It’s bigger than him. I don’t like the Russ fit and they lack perimeter shooting.On June 25, 1999, the exact day I was born, the San Antonio Spurs beat the New York Knicks in the NBA finals to capture the championship.

I know @Dame_Lillard loves Portland. He’s giving everything to that city, state &amp; organization! He’s also Never Denied wanting to play for the @nyknicks either lol.

Knicks havent had consecutive winning seasons…well, that kind of sums it up, @PatBoyle44. I told myself that the @nyknicks season would just be about joy and fun for me - no expectations. that was before the season started.
