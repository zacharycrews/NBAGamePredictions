If he knocked down the wide open threes we would've called the last game his breakout.

Hope to see it tonight!!@Raptors @Invisalign Boucher vs. Siakam, who will play worse? If they lose does MLSE finally pull the plug on Nick Nurse?@Raptors @Invisalign I’m a Raptors fan first and foremost, so Dillon Brooks, you better be nice like a Canadian tonight.@EEJUNGMI @Raptors Honestly give us more@GrizzliesPR @memgrizz @Raptors Soft@DeepakAnandMPP @superfan_nav @CBC @Raptors What #IPL teams do you and @superfan_nav follow?😀Love to see it https://t.co/p9r94GNyCMGame of Predator versus Prey, and Scottie Barnes ain’t the Prey. 🇨🇦

Memphis Grizzlies @ Toronto Raptors Over 215.0 -110

Two teams with leaky defenses, especially from downtown. Both sides can knock down three's as well, so I llike this to comfortably go over the total.

Who will win ??@WalderSports Why did @Raptors trade @JValanciunas?@Raptors @leaguefits @hudsonsbay Ninja Freddy 🥷Even without Trent, Birch &amp; OG I think the @Raptors have enough to pull this win off against the Grizzlies who is without Morant. These are all winnable games and need a big performace from 1 of our bench guys hopefully today for that extra push.Freeze's last day to try and get positive for the month and he's chasing!

Don't get me wrong, this kind of Jonas was suppose to be 5 years ago.Kawhi is the greatest Raptor of all time. When he retires Toronto should retire his jersey and give him his own statue outside the arena. I can’t think of another player who got traded to a poverty franchise and won a championship for them in the same season.#raptors fans thinking of ways to get Jonas back in Toronto.

Pascal just isnt a good fit. Hes a great player o  a championship team. Warriors wisman trade would be perfect. He just doesnt fit anymore now that we have Barnes.@happyerinb @SiakamFan @mandi_andi @Raptors Raptors inefficiencies are rebounding and paint defense along with a plethora of issues around Nurses coaching style. Our record with Pascal should be sufficient enough for anyone to realize he isnt a starter. At least not on this Raptors teams and definitely not over Barnes@Raptors @FredVanVleet I agree, but you need to start winning games@BlueJays @DALANOBANTON @Raptors @NBACanada @nbacares @JaysCare At least mans wearing a Jays hat now, good stuff@Raptors @FredVanVleet cuteness overloads 💓@Raptors Good for him, he put this together for his community centre very quickly.

They’ve never replaced Gasol. We were never winning the chip without him, even with Kawhi. The following year he was showing his age and couldn’t shoot.
