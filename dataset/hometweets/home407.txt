And if so, to what end? https://t.co/AyeL7oHFaj via @thecelticswire@celtics Hope Cs trade him before the game.@stellarct @bronnyyyyy @FishNugget7 @TheNBACentral @JakeLFischer I‚Äôm not a box score watcher, I watch the games, dame is shooting 30 percent as well, would you still leave him open? Boston Celtics are not good as a team, of course his numbers will be bad, they suck as a team rn. I honestly don‚Äôt know what ur point is. I said keep both of emI had a fascinating interview w @BostonGlobe‚Äôs @Dan_Shaughnessy on the glory days of #newspapers, #NBA, and life with @celtics.

https://t.co/qprzEz8T3ILong story short....I had a Boston Celtics starter jacket in high school. Like right when I got to Ft. Campbell (even though I'm not a Celtics fan but that's how starter jackets were). It got stolen when I was at a wrestling meet so I got a triple fat goose to replace it.@KendrickPerkins I truly feel that Jayson Tatum is the expendable one for the Celtics. Jaylen Brown is proving to be the backbone of the Boston Celtics.Which Boston Celtics veteran is most likely to be traded first?@DanSevern_ @ChrisTo52753524 @jarenjacksonjr @memgrizz @jarenjacksonjr for Jay Brown ASAP. @celtics      Maybe a couple picks tooDomantas Sabonis traded to Boston Celtics in Hoops Habit's latest piece https://t.co/7jEQFiz81m Pacers need help now not wait for players to develop! Jaylen and his missed games every yr needs to be the piece Pacers would consider.@BostonCeltics_b This type of role reduction is not going to help sabonis who is in his prime.@BostonCeltics_b If I am sabonis i say no to this trade because Tatum is getting the ball most of the time. He is going to be getting high postups all game where he just turns and fades. This then forces Sabonis to be only a pick a roll guy that gets rebounds and scores off of misses.Adding to Today's NBA Picks

#PickDawgzCapperContest@CoachBryant5 @celtics Last shot of the game I‚Äôm taking those players I named to shoot despite not being the better players. YES@CoachBryant5 @celtics He‚Äôs my favorite player. Obviously he‚Äôs not the goat. Also no reason to trade him. Both the jays are great together. They were in the ECF just a year ago. You build around elite guys, not trade them‚Ä¶ Lastly, if he‚Äôs ‚Äúoverrated‚Äù why would anyone offer anything of value for him?This just confirmed to me my worst fear‚Ä¶ the @celtics suck https://t.co/Xy9wzP8JBc@celtics One of the most underrated players in the league. Glad to have him back.@IrvingRajon @celtics One question. Do you think KD is best player in the league? I do. Just a question@mindykaling @Lakers Oh, man...  I love your work, but aren‚Äôt you from Cambridge, MA - @celtics  territory (and my neck of the woods)?  That‚Äôs disappointing, I‚Äôd hope Carell, Krasinski, and Novak are all disappointed, lol (probably not).

Come on, green‚Äôs for your home town team, too‚Ä¶@IrvingRajon @celtics Giannis or Middleton on your team? Butler or Hero? Joker or Murray? Tatum or Brown? I suppose I made my case! I hope so@IrvingRajon @celtics Well that says all I need to hear. Lol. Wish I was coaching against you. Not personal just a fact. Hero over burtler and Murray over joker. Easy to guard.@IrvingRajon @celtics Stating he is overrated and Boston should take advantage of that and bring a star in w him as bait. Tatum not going anywhere because everyone but you knows that@IrvingRajon @celtics I suggest you don‚Äôt watch the games. I should have seen your goat reference! Lol! Your never going to admit that Brown should be traded. I am not saying he isn‚Äôt a good player. Simply stating he is the only player Boston can trade to get anything.@CoachBryant5 @celtics I want the ball in either of the jays hands. Btw, that doesn‚Äôt determine the better player. I‚Äôd prefer Middleton over Giannis last shot despite Giannis being better, Herro over Butler, Murray over Jokic, Shall I go on?@CoachBryant5 @celtics How is he overrated when the consensus is, Jayson Tatum‚Äôs the best player on Celtics? Obviously JT has been better as of late because Jaylen has battled a hamstring injury for over a month. Btw, Tatum leads the team in turnovers. You clearly don‚Äôt watch the games.What do Dave Cowens and Vladimir Putin have in common?

Lets tank and try to get in the draft lottery 2022 @celtics @CelticsCLNS @NBCSCeltics@IrvingRajon @celtics Question on the two. Last second to win who you want with the ball? Case closed!@IrvingRajon @celtics Granted Tatum was off to a bad start. But since he‚Äôs been by far better than Brown was. My bias against Brown is that he is a turn over waiting to happen and he is over rated. Nothing more nothing less. Have no idea what your speaking of.@CoachBryant5 @celtics It‚Äôs a fact he was our best player this season before he injured his hammy. Don‚Äôt u watch the games? Tatum started the season horribly. &amp; I‚Äôm saying you‚Äôre take is so bad that u must have a bias(unhealthy one) against Jaylen for whatever reason.@nowizera1337 @CrayZfps @nanuzera @DegaFPS @Kodamzera @SafiroVT @FedeeDuran @bullzfps Y boston celtics?@WorldWideWob Go to @celtics https://t.co/dhlGJ6aRfiNBA Basketball Game Betting Picks Simulator: 12/13/2021 7:40 PM ET - Milwaukee Bucks vs. Boston Celtics - YOU CAN RUN THE GAME SIMULATION FOR FREE HERE: https://t.co/3M1QsRyp7s #nba #sportsbetting #freepicks #cappertek@CoachBryant5 @celtics Is tatum not on the exact same team?

Only a 500 team with what supposed to be the best player. Scores a lot early. Turn overs when needed the most. I would bet most NBA GM would take Tatum way before Brown.  if Brown is that good then maybe Lillard could come for him!@iruntwitr @celtics he is available tomorrow against bucksHow I Want The 2022 NBA FINALS To Look Like!!!!
