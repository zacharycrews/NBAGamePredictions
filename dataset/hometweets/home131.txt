I live in OKC territory and REFUSE to cheer for OKC!!! Since Seattle doesn't have a team and the Kings have ties to Kansas City ... I like the Kings ... even though they're the Seattle Mariners of the NBA 😭😭😭Suns looking very meeehhhh at the half. Letting the Rockets out work them so far. Gotta tighten it up and establish their dominance as the better team or we may have another Sacramento Kings game on our hands@RoyalsSac206Fan @SacramentoKings May Sacramento make them wish they stayed home. #Sonics@MrKenRudulphTV @RobParkerFS1 @Chris_Broussard @SacramentoKings @TVG No way.
