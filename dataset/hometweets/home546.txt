@ChoctawCasinos | #StakesRaised https://t.co/Q1FDhpJG21@dallasmavs @quese Sign this man asapThis is also Dallas' first game back home following a five-game road trip that started on Christmas Day in Utah.  It's a terrible spot for the Mavericks for a number of reasons.  Bet the Nuggets Monday.That was a Thunder team missing several key players due to COVID as they failed to cover as 10-point favorites.  The Mavericks are 6-18 ATS in their last 24 games following a win.  Dallas is 6-14 ATS in its last 20 home games.Monday's Free Pick: Denver Nuggets +3.5

The Denver Nuggets have won the first three games of this four-game road trip and I like their chances of pulling off the sweep with another upset victory tonight over the Dallas Mavericks.  That includes an upset win at Golden State@dallasmavs @luka7doncic Not this season boy..@FrankLikina @ALPACADABRAZ @luka7doncic @kporzee And of course @MarkCubansTeam @dallasmavs@BenHilly94 @akundi2010 @dallasmavs @luka7doncic @BEDGEAR Bandwagon fan@dallasmavs @BEDGEAR im hoping i see jalen brunson, luka and kpDallas Mavericks: 3 things to watch for as the Dallas Mavericks:  face off against the Denver Nuggets https://t.co/vPOvcVU8e4üèÄ Dallas Mavericks (@dallasmavs) #MFFL
