@ChoctawCasinos | #StakesRaised https://t.co/Q1FDhpJG21@dallasmavs @quese Sign this man asapThis is also Dallas' first game back home following a five-game road trip that started on Christmas Day in Utah.  It's a terrible spot for the Mavericks for a number of reasons.  Bet the Nuggets Monday.That was a Thunder team missing several key players due to COVID as they failed to cover as 10-point favorites.  The Mavericks are 6-18 ATS in their last 24 games following a win.  Dallas is 6-14 ATS in its last 20 home games.Monday's Free Pick: Denver Nuggets +3.5

The Denver Nuggets have won the first three games of this four-game road trip and I like their chances of pulling off the sweep with another upset victory tonight over the Dallas Mavericks.
