Bamba is a much better option we don't need a center to shoot 3s or score a ton. Play defense, rebound and score at the rim. ( I know Bamba sometimes likes 3s)@SlickPropaganda @hornets @Chriswood_5 My #1 &amp; 2 target is still Turner or Bamba tho@SlickPropaganda @hornets @Chriswood_5 He’s capable if he’s locked in,  only problem.   But it would be a significant upgrade than Plumlee even though he’s had played well the last 3 games@LaneSwish @hornets @Chriswood_5 I'm not sure it's fixable since he's been that way his entire career although he's shown a lot of improvement. But he for sure wouldn't make our defense any better@SlickPropaganda @hornets @Chriswood_5 I think JB could be the one to fix a mindset issue.   To be fair he got into it with a assistant coach@LaneSwish @hornets @Chriswood_5 I thought i wanted him back a couple years ago. But nah.I already got my jersey swap ready😉
@hornets @Chriswood_5 https://t.co/d1BdhBf9XFOn this day in sports history January 2, Chicago Bulls Shooting Guard Jimmy Butler recorded 52 Points, 12 Rebounds, 6 Assists, 3 Steals, and 1 Blocks in a 118-111 win against the Charlotte Hornets in 2017.🔥704 Night🔥
