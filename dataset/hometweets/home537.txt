@Suns #NBA75 #NBATwitter #AllFly@RealTalk900 Lol charlotte hornets curse. Was that the dumbest trade ever? I mean thats worse then the Aldridge tyrus Thomas trade. Worse then the trade up one spot for trubisky trade. Maybe babe Ruth for some cash.Michael Jordan | 1998 |  Playoffs Eastern Semifinals | Game 4 |  31pts |  Vs Charlotte Hornets

Bamba is a much better option we don't need a center to shoot 3s or score a ton. Play defense, rebound and score at the rim. ( I know Bamba sometimes likes 3s)@SlickPropaganda @hornets @Chriswood_5 My #1 &amp; 2 target is still Turner or Bamba tho@SlickPropaganda @hornets @Chriswood_5 He‚Äôs capable if he‚Äôs locked in,  only problem.   But it would be a significant upgrade than Plumlee even though he‚Äôs had played well the last 3 games@LaneSwish @hornets @Chriswood_5 I'm not sure it's fixable since he's been that way his entire career although he's shown a lot of improvement. But he for sure wouldn't make our defense any better@SlickPropaganda @hornets @Chriswood_5 I think JB could be the one to fix a mindset issue.   To be fair he got into it with a assistant coach@LaneSwish @hornets @Chriswood_5 I thought i wanted him back a couple years ago. But nah.I already got my jersey swap readyüòâ
