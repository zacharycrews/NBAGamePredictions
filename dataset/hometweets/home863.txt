Bembry averaged 6.1 PPG, 3.3 RPG on 47.5 FG% &amp; 41.7 3P% in 19.4 MPG in 48 games for Brooklyn. 

Thoughts on the move? ü§î https://t.co/lYOAarmUKgReport: Milwaukee Bucks Signing DeAndre Bembry https://t.co/37jCbPuAMIReport: Free agent DeAndre Bembry is planning to sign with the Milwaukee Bucks. (Per @wojespn)@AlexPena_20 @Bucks Wow! Nice havent really watched the guys game to much. But I‚Äôll take your word@Asadrm15 @Bucks This is a great pickup, i was upset we had to waive him https://t.co/UOH0OkLqhvI‚Äôm still so surprised the Nets let him go. Bembry was a 41.7% 3-pt shooter in Brooklyn and he played some solid defense. He‚Äôll be able to be a rotational guy for the Bucks and have an immediate impact. This is a great pickup for Milwaukee. https://t.co/hpFArnpFr4Los Milwaukee Bucks planean firmar al ex de los Nets, DeAndre Bembry. https://t.co/PUNLce3qC0Today's NBA Consensus (So Far):

‚óæÔ∏è‚óæÔ∏è‚óæÔ∏è@CoCoMiKe12 @TownTart @Bucks Well yea, no good big man. But to say this team loses if they can‚Äôt drain threes can be applied to pretty much every team. IMO, suns and bucks are about as complete as a team can get@berto2361 @eliot_jav @Bucks He doesn't like him wdym, Bucks are short handed Bud has no choice but to play him@Bucks I think Khris should be traded after this season for Lillard possibly.@eliot_jav @Bucks Don‚Äôt worry you never have.@Bucks This proves that Giannis carries and the Bucks are low-mid without him.@Bucks play defense, learn how to handle the ball and stop turning it over, and get someone who can actually lead the team when giannis isn‚Äôt playing cuz y‚Äôall literally a lottery team without him üíÄüíÄüíÄ.@Bucks You left your defense in Cali.Hard to pin 71 points on the @Bucks in a half, with or without @Giannis_An34. That‚Äôs a good half of basketball for the local lads.

They are tanking!Milwaukee is down 17 to the Blazers right now. Both Middleton and Portis lead the team with 11 PTS, but the team overall seems to be struggling with shot selection.
