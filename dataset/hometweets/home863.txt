Bembry was a 41.7% 3-pt shooter in Brooklyn and he played some solid defense. He’ll be able to be a rotational guy for the Bucks and have an immediate impact.

https://t.co/IIuYCTQkL5@trailblazers @IAmJustise After a play like that, I am officially done supporting the Milwaukee Bucks. Time and time again they keep breaking my heart. I will take my fandom to a well-run team in the Detroit Pistons.Chicago Bulls - Won
Milwaukee Bucks - Lost
Toronto Raptors - Lost

Another good night for the Bulls@Bucks @sergeibaka @JewelersMutual Sold gameThanks @Bucks and @Dsabonis11 https://t.co/V40KUGE0w4B2B dimes from Simons and that'll do it folks. 

Blazers go into Milwaukee and absolutely house the Bucks. 

Even without Giannis, this is a GREAT win for the young guys. Simons took on Jrue and won. 

The tank... might be stuck.🚨 UPDATE: Khris Middleton - Milwaukee Bucks has a Double Double
