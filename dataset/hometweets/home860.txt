@HawksOnBally #TrueToAtlanta #BeatTheCavs https://t.co/LfIMHoAl0z https://t.co/zN9Z8DNegHNew post (Cleveland Cavaliers vs Atlanta Hawks NBA Pick – February 15) has been published on The Sports Geek - https://t.co/KXwBlaY755 https://t.co/1I2NcCcGvi@GameplanChicago @ATLHawks @UniWatch @Shakabrodie Exactly. Unexpectedly enough, in Europe Champion had a much different approach to their replica jerseys (no screen-printing), which resulted in a much more faithful final product (design-wise). I was able to acquire a bunch of them in Italy in ‘95. Orlando, Seattle, Charlotte… https://t.co/UP7S90S46s@FUT_AST @ATLHawks Yes but they also have one of the worst offenses in the league whenever Trae is on the bench and Cooper can help with finding better shots 💯

▪️W/Trae on the court:
117.44 offensive rating
54.31% 2P (5th-best)

▪️W/Trae off the court:
108.11 offensive rating
48.10% 2P (worst)@DanteCampana @ATLHawks @UniWatch Yes. Production limitations caused many of the Champion replicas to look drastically different from the authentic jerseys. I recall a maximum 12” x 12” screen print limitation at one point but I could be mistaken. @Shakabrodie might have more details?@404NaCl @MikeBellATL @ATLHawks Gary Trent us a microwave and KJ is one of the best catch n shoot players in the league.

When Bogi, Gallo, Trae are on the floor we get beat on penetration.  Our players on skates, scrambling to recover.  Defense is atrocious.  Red Velvet average at best.  Trae is awful.@MikeBellATL @ATLHawks It's lack of focus/intensity during regular-season games, mainly on defense. They don't hustle back on defense and give up too many easy buckets.

https://t.co/d744zp0bPM@ryanteston @cjamalj @MikeBellATL @ATLHawks It is only hard if you pay a really good role player like a star.   They paid JC 100m and we need another playmaker. If another team was willing to pay 100 for a John Collins then they should have let them.. Next are in luxury tax land next year with this subpar team🤔@MikeBellATL @ATLHawks Just aren’t that good.  I mean if they were would their record be this bad.  You are what your record says you are. And right now it says they just aren’t that good.

Sounds like front office F'Up🤔. Also for 100m JC hardly ever shuts down the opposing PF.  Most of his blocks are weak side help blocks and his dunks are largely lobs from Trae.@MikeBellATL @ATLHawks I agree EXCEPT for Trae.  All is numbers are better than last year. Everyone else are just collecting checks especially John Collins. Who pays 100m for 15 to 16pts a game.  If Trae is out does JC drop 30? Nope you'll get the same 15 or 16 pts from shooting 3s and no shut down D.Atlanta Hawks All-Star Trae Young is on Team Durant – NBA News https://t.co/yrSpDp8VUYDear @ATLHawks,

https://t.co/iLzQcF0wi5@MikeBellATL @ATLHawks well the + by - narrative fell short like a Huerter wide open 3.  Hawks just need to play better defense...unfortunately our front court is in the top 5 of worst defense being played this year..you could start Bogi, but you lose bench points. Maybe Bembry can come back lol.My daughter bought me this sweet @ATLHawks hat! #TrueToAtlanta https://t.co/GMv4zA2THBNever received the full story on this early 1990's @ATLHawks Dominique Wilkins SLU figurine. The long vertical stripes never happened on the actual Champion game uniforms. Quite the curiosity w/o an background clarification. @UniWatch https://t.co/QG1Qau0IMU@ATLHawks @KLChouinard @CapelaClint He ight@ATLHawks @KLChouinard @CapelaClint where that been at https://t.co/rte6VpIzsd"When the Hawks roll out their starting lineup and organize their defense, Clint Capela is the keystone. He blocks shots. He alters shots. He gets steals."

John Collins on the other hand…that’s yall homeboy not mine 😅 https://t.co/L6HI2UJ8sl@MikeBellATL @ATLHawks The NBA is a Different Game, don’t even get me started on that. But unsure if the younger players are bent on winning. They have come up watching the load management NBA. Where stars sit when not injured. When Trae made the regular season is boring comment, I was sad.Lauri Markkanen is out tomorrow for the Cleveland Cavaliers against the Atlanta Hawks.

#Cavs head coach J.B. Bickerstaff said he was progressing but he likely won’t be back until after the All-Star break.
