ABTA &amp; Atol Protected https://t.co/PdApwXYtk4The Celtics held Philadelphia to 28.7% shooting Tuesday night, not only a season low for an opponent.  It was the Celtics' lowest opponent field goal percentage since the Magic shot 24.6% in Orlando in January of 2012.

To win the game against Spurs@NBAonTNT @Hoophall @HoustonRockets @OrlandoMagic @Raptors @NBA One of my favorite T-Mac moments was when he had the duel with Jordan in ‚Äò03 and Jordan had gave him the sneakers he played in that game. The another moment was the duel vs Kobe when they both had 38 pts.@NBAonTNT @Hoophall @HoustonRockets @OrlandoMagic @Raptors @NBA As far as skill set Tracy McGrady was the Kevin Durant of his era. I have always viewed Kobe Bryant success in the NBA as the ‚Äúwhat if‚Äù version of Tmac‚Äôs. They were 1A and 1B as shooting guards then. Tmac is not only top 75 player but a top 30 player ever.One of the best plays by the Orlando Magic this season. https://t.co/UfjWv3rItcOrlando Magic vs. Detroit¬†Pistons https://t.co/g9O7jMmRa3@boldcitybooks @OrlandoMagic @booutlawfan Jersey?

33. 2020-21 NBA Draft: Orlando Magic get two quality 1st round picks with G Jalen Suggs and F Franz Wagner at No.'s 5 &amp; 8, respectively https://t.co/5Bek0Pyh8D@firedonniedanny @OrlandoMagic I have another arm.@booutlawfan @OrlandoMagic Breaking: Orlando Magic have just changed their popular ‚ÄúBasketball- Swoosh‚Äù logo with a Magic hat and wandThe Orlando Magic have a really nice young core. Fultz, Suggs, Wagner, Isaac, &amp; Carter starting. With Anthony, Hampton, Okeke, a top 5 pick, &amp; Bol coming off the bench has so much potential. Gotta find that superstar.Turning point last season came right before the All Star Break with wins against the Heat and Magic (started 16-20, but finished 25-11)

Hawks are in position to do something similar with tonight's win &amp; tomorrow's matchup vs. Orlando.
