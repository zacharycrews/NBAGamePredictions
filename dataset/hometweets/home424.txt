what we think about this one? https://t.co/pSqw17253kIf Kings are buyers, they really only have Hield, Bagley, TT, Harkless, Len, Jones, and the young guys plus their picks that they'd be willing to move, right?

#sacramentokingsany team that picks up Marvin Bagley will probably be getting an amazing discount on him.

What a fucking disgrace! Fuck the stars and the fans!Praying the @SacramentoKings @mmcnair get some solid trades@MikeAdxx @SacramentoKings Ok, I'm not going to get all dramatic, and rip the effort. Here's the issue with that trade. You can't give up ALL THREE of JRich, Nesmith, and Langford. I'd do the deal for Hield for Nesmith, Langford, and a conditional 1st. Held is quite literally exactly what the Celtics need.@JillAdge Watching the @SacramentoKings play doesn‚Äôt count as a horror movieImagine if the Sacramento kings traded for Westbrook üò≠PERIOD! I‚Äôm over Boucher, Svi and Malachi. It‚Äôs just consistent mess when they play against anyone not named Sacramento Kings lol. The bench can‚Äôt just be Yuta and that‚Äôs it. It can‚Äôt.
