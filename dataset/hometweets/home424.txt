The Sacramento Kings are playing at a breakneck pace of late.  The OVER is 7-3 in their last 10 games overall with seven of those games seeing 225 or more combined points.@washedwiz Dinwiddie, Kuz and a 1st lets go @SacramentoKings 😂So @mmcnair if you can’t trade buddy for Myles turner which you should be able to do and keep Bagley because he is a great 4 fit next to him then please inquire about the following 
Any of these deals make @SacramentoKings better! https://t.co/5UqIrhoJCB@AkutsuChi I’d say the same but I’ve had to watch the Sacramento Kings play basketball for 18 years so anime is all I got@poundcoyne They were down about 20, I checked my phone and they were up 20. Kinda the opposite of this season’s Sacramento KingsHe was a wonderful, wonderful man. Whenever we visited, he would buy us Lucky Charms because my parents wouldn’t let us have them. He taught us to play golf and cards. He faked his age to get a senior discount on Giants tickets. He’s the only Sacramento Kings fan I have ever met.Kings gameday live: Wizards’ Montrezl Harrell, Kyle Kuzma could have been Sacramento Kings https://t.co/mYd0kyb3R7HOY JUEGAN LOS KINGS!

I’ve said this for many years God hates the Sacramento Kings…. 😑 https://t.co/VJouY9nkgSThe Blazers have lost 6 straight and 9 of their last 10.

They have the 2nd worst defense and have the same record as the Sacramento Kings.

Great draft choices there. 😂Relevant once again @SacramentoKings https://t.co/dVyi2mw4As@Jay6uala @celtics @SacramentoKings @Pacers @Timberwolves well it would be the only way to get the other skillful young players and flip the older ones into other young players or picks@DripfaceP @celtics @SacramentoKings @Pacers @Timberwolves They wouldn't trade the rookie chris duarte then 🤣@Jay6uala @celtics @SacramentoKings @Pacers @Timberwolves naw man those are assets for the future of the team@DripfaceP @celtics @SacramentoKings @Pacers @Timberwolves there not rebuilding they might be looking to trade for a star and if they were why does everyone think pacers are just having a fire sale giving there players up for nothing@SacramentoKings still no trade https://t.co/GYDv6zeWasI unfortunately got drafted by The Sacramento Kings on 2k11.@Jay6uala @celtics @SacramentoKings @Pacers @Timberwolves pacers are rebuilding so they need de'aaron fox  and then they could trade al if they want a younger player but al is good so i dont think they would trade him right away@jowyang Began looking into buying the Sacramento Kings once I was a crypto trillionaire but that was short lived@celtics @SacramentoKings @Pacers @Timberwolves this trade gotta happen this season@celtics @SacramentoKings @Pacers @Timberwolves why t-wolves do it.this one was hard but they get an allstar sabonis and carris levert, a talented duo and jeremy lamb and if you keep anthony edwards and patrick beverley, thisteam could make another trade to get ben simmons, westbrook, or kyrie with the assets and make playoffs@DripfaceP @celtics @SacramentoKings @Pacers @Timberwolves The pacers would hang up so fast and maybe throw up after@celtics @SacramentoKings @Pacers @Timberwolves kings get a star PG DLO Myles turner who leads the league in blocks good for defense young guard in chris and Josh richardson who can be flipped or used for defense. think about it, this team could make the playoffs. If they include marvin in another trade they are contenders.@celtics @SacramentoKings @Pacers @Timberwolves celtics get shooting in buddy hield and get a star big in KAT@celtics @SacramentoKings @Pacers @Timberwolves 
what we think about this one? https://t.co/pSqw17253kIf Kings are buyers, they really only have Hield, Bagley, TT, Harkless, Len, Jones, and the young guys plus their picks that they'd be willing to move, right?

#sacramentokingsany team that picks up Marvin Bagley will probably be getting an amazing discount on him. Sacramento kings fans are going to look at him in a couple of years and feel pain seeing how much he's progressed by then.New Jason Williams custom framing by @sportsdisplays 🔥 🔥 🔥 .

Stars suck ass! Get that through ur head! This team is like the Sacramento kings! No more playoff appreareces for the next 15 years at least! Last time u won a cup was over 20 years ago! What a fucking disgrace! Fuck the stars and the fans!Praying the @SacramentoKings @mmcnair get some solid trades@MikeAdxx @SacramentoKings Ok, I'm not going to get all dramatic, and rip the effort. Here's the issue with that trade. You can't give up ALL THREE of JRich, Nesmith, and Langford. I'd do the deal for Hield for Nesmith, Langford, and a conditional 1st. Held is quite literally exactly what the Celtics need.@JillAdge Watching the @SacramentoKings play doesn’t count as a horror movieImagine if the Sacramento kings traded for Westbrook 😭PERIOD! I’m over Boucher, Svi and Malachi. It’s just consistent mess when they play against anyone not named Sacramento Kings lol. The bench can’t just be Yuta and that’s it. It can’t. Champagnie tries but he can’t shoot for shit. https://t.co/SDm59XgtcjDomantas Sabonis can provide the Sacramento Kings much-needed stability in the post.
