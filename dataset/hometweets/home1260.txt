Just can’t go down 3-1. Jazz have not shown much fight and Dallas seems to have them locked down. Why is Utah favored again? We should get a solid effort here.

Sure wish that I and supportive Jazz fans could say that it was the opposite of that. Talent alone is not enough...as we've seen.The Dallas Mavericks have thrived at generating open 3s against the Utah Jazz and are leading the NBA in playoff catch-and-shoot scoring by a wide margin.

That is what is going to happen…isn’t it…@MicheleBachmann was the MTG of the Late-Aughts and Early 2010s. In hindsight it was better she quit while she was ahead.

How I know my love for the @utahjazz runs DEEP. #TakeNote@utahjazz @MisterCBooz I was in the stands for darn near every one of your games! What a pleasure!@utahjazz @MisterCBooz If the Jazz can just get the league to officiate the games fairly, they can win a championship *THIS YEAR*! 

But that's a big if!Utah Jazz hedge Mike Conley 2x with Danuel House Jr. at the point of attack vs. Spencer Dinwiddie, and the 2nd screen leads to House Jr. being a tick behind the play

Drives left and gets right to his strong hand

The Utah Jazz need him to be the 3rd head of the 3-headed snake https://t.co/uesiz7EguoThe Utah Jazz went small in the second half of Game 3 against the Dallas Mavericks. Donovan Mitchell feels they'll "look to capitalize on" smaller lineups going forward.

For @MavericksSI, I wrote about the Jazz going small vs. the Mavericks: https://t.co/nRXEQIxbxyUtah Jazz tomorrow gonna flip the doomed team narrative #TakeNote https://t.co/UpmwkP39guLove seeing Josh Green firing with confidence despite the Utah Jazz putting Rudy Gobert on him to maximize his help defense and rim protection

Look what keeps happening to the Utah JazzThe Hawks are the eastern conference versus of the Utah Jazz.  Total fuckups@OlehKosel @DMGrubb I like the Pelicans name. The only problem I have with the Jazz is that it is ridiculous that of all cities Salt Lake City has it. NY, Kansas City, Memphis, lots of cities have some fit with the name Jazz. But Utah Jazz is as stupid the NOLA Polar Bears.@utahjazz The difference between Shaq and Kobe vs Rudy and Don both trying to prove everyone “who’s team it is“  is the fact that the previous two have rings and #HOF careers.

But I will always say Jose Ortiz, because that's my terrible draft memory.Jalen Brunson followed up his amazing 41 point performance from Game 2 with 31 points in Game 3 to give the @dallasmavs the 2-1 series lead.

That elbow to Brunson's back really should have been grounds for suspension.Trent Forrest and Udoka Azubuike remain out for the @utahjazz tomorrow in Game 4.Clearly, this is to be believed, because nobody knows the inner workings of the Utah Jazz better than some random guy who happens to have a blue check mark on his Twitter page, for being on the radio in a town 1200 miles away from Salt Lake City https://t.co/Iq67ZOI9AmMavericks win game 3 over the jazz(reaction) https://t.co/m9i2YdGu4i via @YouTube #djbackwards36 #dallasmavericks #mavsnation #lukadoncic #jalenbrunson #utahjazz #jazznation #donovanmitchell #rudygobert #nbaplayoffs #nbaplayoffs2022 #firstround https://t.co/sqrFuQs3ZzYea it’s time to ship Mitchell to the @nyknicks @utahjazz he clearly is tired of losing .. especially in Utah https://t.co/I4jFaWw12QUtah Jazz lose to Jalen Brunson, Dallas Mavericks in playoff Game 3 https://t.co/araKwc7wQk@utahJAZZ__ @PlantsLoveMagic I hate anyone calling me unannounced@kslsports @BensHoops @utahjazz Well, it was a good couple decades, but I AM OUT! Not impressed with Mr. Smith and his hiring of Ainge, play has been disappointing and not entertaining, the effort to eliminate all links to Utah vis-à-vis the jerseys is just too much.@Mike_McCorms @Tjonesonthenba @Raptors @utahjazz Last season they were legit. This season they have not been good at any point. Unless you want to really reach and count that stretch in February which was around 8 games long. The record may have looked good in the first half of the season. But they were not good in reality.I reject all Utah Jazz uniform color schemes that don’t look like this https://t.co/xJQddLuu3E@snark_tank Utah Jazz social media is very well managed.

https://t.co/JN5Dx4aLetBehind Jalen Brunson's stellar 31-point performance in Game 3, the Dallas Mavericks have now taken the first round series lead against the Utah Jazz. That's right, he's done it again. https://t.co/62LE4wHJ0c@All_Things_Mavs Take note @utahjazz - this is not how a good team behaves on the bench 😁#MFFL@Dunzod That’s what I like about Colin is that he is logical and keeps it real and I am a huge Utah jazz fan since 1984@CactusRedsOgden @utahjazz 3 times! All Jazz wins 😎@pledthefif @nick__e2 @1Pierre64 @MLBONFOX That's not the point. The point is that they're already as big as some baseball markets and will be even bigger in the future. The Utah Jazz consistently sold out games when they weren't good.Thinking Rudy Gorbet is the Utah jazz problem in this day in age is somethingThese scream Oregon Ducks to me, not the Utah Jazz https://t.co/6wuoVMqzbWFormer Houston Rockets forward Daniel House, Jr. might play for the Utah Jazz, but he doesn't like em https://t.co/Uh2idfY0onWhen a player on the Utah Jazz falls down, Donovan Mitchell is always there to help them up. 

Meanwhile, he had a historic series to remember for the ages and literally his opponent was the first one to help him. Remember this when they say Mitchell is a bad teammate/leader. https://t.co/MmyPRK0BBQ“What’s crazy, No Kawhi last year, [the Jazz] lose. They might lose to the Mavericks without Luka Doncic. Even crazier,  Luka might get to round two for the first time and he’s not even fucking playing. He’s wearing street clothes.”

- Bill Simmons on the Utah Jazz

Imma lay down now... https://t.co/2eIk088uTeThe @utahjazz have averaged 9 made threes in the first 3 games of the series while shooting 34.1%.

In the regular season they averaged 14.5 3PT per game (2nd in NBA) on 36% shooting.

The Mavericks have averaged 20 made threes on 45% shooting in the last two games.

Mavs up 2-1.@HoboJ_ @Tjonesonthenba @Raptors @utahjazz First half was good. And they were the 1st seed last season. I was referring to the last few seasons.

Thank me later@DHawes22 @utahjazz That court design! 🤩These are "5 minutes in Photoshop" cheap. No wonder everyone looked like they were in a hurry to change teams last night. There's no flair at all. Based on these jerseys, this'll be the wordmark they use on broadcasts in 22-23:

But I do know OKC owns the Jazz’s 1st round pick protected 1-10 in 2024, 1-10 in 2025 and 1-8 in 2026.Not being too emotionally invested in the #UtahJazz is so freeing #TakeNoteUtah Jazz lost 2 games to...

D wade i will take that seat any timeIs this a joke? These look like 8th grade rec league jerseys. Because Dwyane Wade's mom couldn't figure out what the Jazz colors were, they ditched the Purple, Yellow, Green for Black, White, Yellow? Easily the worst uniforms in the NBA.
