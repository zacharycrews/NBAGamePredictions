@OrlandoMagic@FossyGFX @Stake Let's get this @OrlandoMagic@theraptorsjays @CentralCapper Magic been playing good lately and they healthy now. Harden has no Defens this scares me but I wanna take 76ers so bad and Orlando homeConfused as to why The Orlando Magic at 18-50 are marked as eliminated from the playoffs, but the Pistons, with the exact same record are not yet marked as eliminated? Suspect ESPN just hasn't yet updated the standings with that detail for the Pistons.Most orlando moment ever.

The Orlando magic own us@crckhdc00ch @medicalmocha @orlando_dragfan @SheaCoulee Might be too late for the thread but I always used Magic Shave especially the formula with the shea butter. The one time used a regular Nair it smelled awful and left me patchy.This is what we should’ve done yesterday. We got embarrassed by the Orlando magic. Worst team in the NBA. Good comeback win. Nah great comeback win. #TimberwolvesWhy don’t the timeberwolves play like this against the Orlando Magicso the first team to be mathematically eliminated from playoff contention is somehow not the pistons, rockets or thunder, but the orlando magic. i knew they’d be bad but not THIS bad.Jalen Suggs scores 5 points on 2/7 shooting (1/4 from 3) with a rebound, 4 assists, a steal, and 3 turnovers in a win over the Timberwolves @jalensuggs @OrlandoMagic@TisaKorean @DrettiFranks Orlando magic gear@citybeautifulsc City went full Orlando Magic.

Go figureI stg the Orlando Magic’s bench has Better offense than our starting lineup offenseLewis Hamilton has been at the pinnacle of the coolest, richest sport on earth for over a decade yet he insists on dressing like a role player on the 2002 Orlando Magic.@OrlandoMagic @VishalKG1 imagine being Sean and not having this front court@BoldCityCap Not me.  Only go there if I'm headed to one of the parks, or a Magic/Orlando City SC game.@StateNYKPOD On the Knicks! @OrlandoMagic give us one of Cole or Suggs, Terrance Ross and Mo Bamba and we’ll slide yall Randle.

Only intolerable outcome is either guy having to drag the team to victory for 38 min against the frisky Magic and being gassed for Monday's must-win.@Magic_PR @OrlandoMagic @MakeAWishCNFL @nbacares Then why did the DeVos family fund the insurrection of 1/6/21 ???@therealflannerz @OrlandoMagic Sorry Adam lol@OrlandoMagic @MagicMarkee Does it work in the UK? 😂@RepValDemings Happy birthday.
