Used to be elite years ago but the new arenas have blown by (in terms of clubs).

I noticed Monday that the seats are beat up, cup holders broken, seats loose. Age creeping in.NBA Betting Tip🏀
Orlando Magic - Indiana Pacers

Indiana Pacers 1H ML @ 1.90 ($100)

The Orlando Magic might be the worst 1H team in the NBA right now.  Lost the 1H in 7 straight matches against the Pacers, and are 0-5 ATS in 1Q in L5.

Paid extra money, which I didn't have to sit closer to the floor. Dwight Howard knocked Derrick out of the air on a layup early in Q1. Derrick left injured; didn't return. Magic won by a million.@jqkennedy17 @OrlandoMagic @DREAMTEAMLIGHT @PapiTrumpo @markeykennedy @monsters_a_gogo @austerewyatt1 @whitehatbuzz @JaneProvidence @JohnKen19991776 💯. Not a fan of drama- it pulls the frequency down. I realized those who attract drama are living from the energy of their wounds rather than their spirit. Spirit is light and is magic, a much nicer energy to live from.✨❤️✨@OrlandoMagic Let’s make it back to back 😈@OrlandoMagic magic gonna catch another dub tonight@OrlandoMagic Back to Back dubs?Orlando Magic Starters:

Orlando is firmly shaping its future in these final 20 games: https://t.co/Yw04jkZn02The NBA should have a team called the old dogs , only players aged 40 plus . Then the OrlandoMagic could maybe get a few wins each season , until T Ross joins the old dogs 🐶With only 20 games left, do you expect Jonathan Isaac to play this season? #MagicTogether #OrlandoMagic #NBAINDIANA PACERS vs
ORLANDO MAGIC, 8:00PM.Back at it tonight against the Pacers as the Magic will try to make it three wins in a row. 

Hopefully we will get to see Markelle on the court with Cole and / or Suggs.

In 2003, the Magic almost became the third 8th seed team to upset a 1st seed. Almost. Before Game 5, T-Mac said: “It feels good to be in the 2nd round.” It did not end well. It was all Detroit needed to hear to dismantle Orlando by 20.3 points in the last 3 games! https://t.co/9xaZ07LArEThe Orlando Magic will be Champions in 1-3 years@ClutchPointsApp @OrlandoMagic I love my magic 💙@OrlandoMagic @MarkelleF "The comeback is always greater than the setback."
Excited to see u play Markelle💪#20BallSweepstakes @VinVinPhillyHad a great time at Collectacon 2022 Orlando FL. Quick post covering my highlights: Top highlight got to snap a pic with @KingCash_7191 who Im a big fan of his magic the gathering content. My family are all huge Steelers fans and enjoyed his run with the Black &amp; Gold. https://t.co/FQBEXKcdif@NBAMemes Imagine Orlando magic drafted him 💀At this point, Orlando Magic&gt;&gt;&gt;GSWso difficult for me to root for any South Florida sports teams. Going to start following the Orlando Magic 💫

Then tell all Orlando to rise as one and take to the streets until the Magic release Isaac’s entire medical history. 

You completely fumbled the puck at the rim on this one.@khalilibn7 Still upsets me watching his highlights and that 30 For 30 about the Orlando Magic.Warriors are basically the Orlando magic right now 🤨 Poole has effectively driven this team over the cliff 🤨 Curry is alone with his brother in law trying to be something that he never was 🤔 When you see Looney take the last resort shot after it was passed by it says we fuc'dWho would you rather have? #NBA @DetroitPistons @OrlandoMagic@kurtk65 I wore my Kobe jersey in Orlando during finals against the Magic, wow I heard it, surprisingly also a few cheersPokemon, Toku, and The Orlando Magic. https://t.co/SSrhGHK4hoOrlando Magic gonna be the best team in the East in 3 years.

I recently completed my Orlando Magic set. I was fortunate enough to pull a Jeff Hornacek and sold that to purchase the RIB Jameer Nelson and Oladipo. Now I can buy Series 2 Magic moments for $3 and get 36 cs per moment@OrlandoMagic @MarkelleF #20BallSweepstakes wishing to winProbably my favorite part of today's chat with @OrlandoMagic GM John Hammond...he mentions that he was at the Iowa game last night (presumably scouting Keegan Murray) and that Kelle gave him the go ahead to miss the game live. Super candid moment.
