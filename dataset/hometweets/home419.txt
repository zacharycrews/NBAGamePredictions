This is the Way. 

Positive Vibes Only. 

Get well soon Giannis/Wes/Donte/Khris.@Bucks @MotorolaUS @Khris22m Yes sir Khash MoneyLooks like Middleton's injury wasn't serious. It's going to be a tough stretch for @Bucks with several key players (including Giannis) under COVID-19 protocols. A loss to @csmcdaniel's Pacers seems like a real possibility. https://t.co/lGZihMbd6g@Bucks @MotorolaUS @Khris22m Holy crap is Khris gonna play???@EricStokesSzn3 @Bucks @MotorolaUS @Khris22m You got notis on??Back at home.
