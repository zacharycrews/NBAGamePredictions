My Grandparents briefly lived in Houston, but I don't think the Rockets are a much better option.The beautiful and sometimes life-saving distraction of sports. How being an ultra sports fan as a kid in Houston saved my life.

At least his teammates and Cavs fans didn’t turn our backs on him@mariuscojocaruu @bodieondacorner @TheClevelandEra @CFrobley @HoustonRockets tell me, have you genuinely sat down and watched the past 2 rockets games or are u just watching the box score?Houston #Rockets are't going to buy out John Wall contract. If they have to pay him anyway, why not pay him to sit untill he can be traded &amp; get something, anything, in return. Next year that big 1 year expiring contract is probably more valuable than his 20ppg.

The awesome defense, passing, and renounding are all meaningless. Very good take.@TheClevelandEra @HoustonRockets It’s almost like 2 games is too early to judge but I wanted both so it’s whatever. Consider it payment for giving us KPJ practically for free@bodieondacorner @TheClevelandEra @HoustonRockets management's fault for giving away his locker to TAURENCE PRINCE that made him do what he did. Honestly i would explode to if i had to work in cleveland. thank you very much@KenyonFan @TheClevelandEra @HoustonRockets Fleeced? The Cavs gave dude away LOL@beltwayboyz @bodieondacorner @TheClevelandEra @CFrobley @HoustonRockets yeah kpj is a great talent, but a bad teammate and bad person outside the court we don’t want that type of people in the locker room and we don’t even care anymore about him@TheClevelandEra @HoustonRockets yeah we are cool with that we got our guy yall got yours. but like imagine getting fleeced out of kpj for nothing LMMAMAMOOOO@beltwayboyz @mariuscojocaruu @TheClevelandEra @CFrobley @HoustonRockets Trust me. Nobody in Cleveland is sweating KPJ anymore. Please believe I was HURT.... That’s old news now lol Mobley should’ve went #1 on his defensive ability ALONE. Now you tell me he has handles. Elite court vision. Touch around the rim. 3 point ability. Lob threat.....@mariuscojocaruu @bodieondacorner @TheClevelandEra @CFrobley @HoustonRockets Anthony Bennett was a generational talent too huh? 😂😂 thanks for Kpj though 🥰Pronostico Boston Celtics vs Houston Rockets | NBA 25-10-21  #BleedGreen  #BleedGreen #Rockets #NBA #bettingtips #basketball

Elite defender. While jalen only put 9 points up against the worst defensive team in the league@ProFootballTalk Also a bust: Jalen Green.
