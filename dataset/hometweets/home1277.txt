#takenote“Utah Jazz center Rudy Gobert explained Thursday that swelling around his nose and eye was the result of being stung by a bee from his own beehive at his Salt Lake City home.” 

(Utah loss Friday will end their season but, hey.)It's a MUST win tonight for the @utahjazz Can they force a game 7?

@utahjazz Vs. @dallasmavs Game 6

Pregame begins at 7pm with @JakeScottZone @tlacomb broadcasting live from @vivintarena plaza. 

Tip off 8pm with @DLocke09 @1041straight 

Listen: @ZoneSportsNet @kslsports https://t.co/YFvVFLjPgZ@BodkinKSLsports @Larsen_ESPN Looks like the #UtahJazz were logging more steals than the stats might've shown

https://t.co/4DXs8Y2wD4@NBA @sixers @Suns @dallasmavs @Raptors @PelicansNBA @utahjazz Prediction for the Suns game. The refs will call twice as many fouls on the Suns &amp; either Booker or Paul will get an early T so the refs can prevent any complaints.@utjazzmuse @spidadmitchell @utahjazz @ATLHawks @HawksMuse I just don't see a valid replacement for Donovan in this deal. We could maybe parlay these guys into a bigger talent down the road, but with no picks that's hard. I'd say at least a first, maybe two firsts.I BELIEVE IN THE UTAH JAZZ!!!!!! 🖤🤍💛 #takenoteLink to watch  NBA Game: Boston Celtics vs Brooklyn Nets stream in tweet below:

@NBA@DLocke09 @utahjazz The entire colony, Locke.We’ve been hacked! @utahjazz https://t.co/mZWCFf6nc6@danclayt0n Mention of NCAA Champ was mainly to indirectly reference Jared Butler--although it does suggest some experience with winning in tournaments. 

Conley's Buckeyes were merely runners-up lol.

#UtahJazz@thescrvnr I haven’t seen very many shows in my life, but I feel so lucky that one of them was Jimmy Smith and his whole band. Utah Jazz &amp; blues fest. 1997 I think?@utahjazz @ATTSportsNetRM @NBAonTNT @ZoneSportsNet @kslnewsradio @vivintarena Let’s go out and win boys 💙💛💚@utahjazz 🥱🥱🥱🥱🥱🥱🥱🥱🤠🤠🤠 LET'S GOOOOOOOOO MAVS https://t.co/yLJVcanBUB@danclayt0n But Quin failed to give Butler playing time during the season, which made it even less likely that Quin would play him in the playoffs.

Which means that Brunson is the latest lesser-known undersized guard to pwn the Jazz--and make himself some bank, repeating #UtahJazz history@DatKidJohny @utahjazz Hell yeah it is and it’s so loud in there hahaha Will see if they can pull it out@GoldyRisa @jakefinw3 @NBAonTNT @Suns @PelicansNBA @dallasmavs @utahjazz That series will never end. First 15 game series 🤣@warriorhunt @DLocke09 @utahjazz I don’t think that does much good. It’s too late for desperation and House or Hernangomez or Gay aren’t game changers.
