@ShamsCharania Hopefully it‚Äôs nothing serious, lots of respect in Toronto for Dragic. We‚Äôll make sure he stays in great shape until we unleash him for the mad playoff run later in the season. The Raptors know exactly what they‚Äôre doing!@Raptors @wacchi1013 Last year we tanked after losing 12 of our first 20 games, realizing we could not make it without at least 2 effective bigs. This year, we lost 11 of our first 20 games. Without the bigs and going positionless, we are not tanking. We are losing. But still fighting.@Raptors Hope all the best for him‚Ä¶but I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs because of the snow.but also, let‚Äôs get this win for birthday girl ‚ù§Ô∏è @Raptors #wethenorth https://t.co/YDOC5QLkCjGoran Dragic leaves Toronto Raptors because of unspecified personal matter.
