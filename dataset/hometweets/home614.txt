PF: O'Neale
C: Paschall

Who am I missing?When asked about the “center” spot tonight, @utahjazz HC Quin Snyder says, “Well, it’s a position.”

I may be 5’10” but I’m good for 7-9 minutes off the bench tonight. Give him 5 fouls, maybe an assist and an 0-3 showing from the floor — just to keep the defense honest

ThanksWhat is to blame for this recent Utah Jazz losing streak?

https://t.co/GlUc6MOx6rI just liked “Utah Jazz Director's Cut” on #Vimeo: https://t.co/QfVktnneWDBut Jordan also had genius-level defensive instincts. Take, for example, the sequence that set up his iconic final shot as a Bull against the Utah Jazz in the 1998 NBA Finals. https://t.co/BA0ByTrtutNBA Basketball Game Betting Picks Simulator: 9:10 PM ET - Cleveland Cavaliers vs. Utah Jazz - YOU CAN RUN THE GAME SIMULATION FOR FREE HERE: https://t.co/OtqjlkwDLV #nba #sportsbetting #freepicks #cappertekRookie @CadeCunningham_ set a career best with 29 points as Detroit Pistons came from behind to beat the Utah Jazz 126-116 in the @NBA

Even today every sleepless night is worth it. Go Jazz.@jazzteamfan @utahjazz It is special with me. I am a Jazz-fan from Germany.  It started with the 1992 olympics...all the big and strong players like Barkey, Ewing etc....and the rather "invisible" @12Johnstockton. Die hard Jazz-fan from this moment on. So many nights without sleep because of the time..Congratulations to 3Rims (@TakeNote77) and Crypto_moon (@TopShotHotShot1) who moved up to take #2 and #10 on the Utah Jazz team leaderboard.

#TakeNote #Utah Jazz@jazzteamfan @utahjazz John Stockton and my favorite Jazz moment was when he nailed the 3 to take us to the finals against one of the first super teams. The rockets…. Here me and my son Jazz Taylor born this year https://t.co/80CqmWVbum@jazzteamfan @utahjazz John Stockton - when he hit the 3 to send them@to the nba finals@The_1_Real_Matt Hey @x__leela__x are you ready for the @utahjazz to beat down the @Lakers in a few weeks #TakeNote... whatya going to do after that loss... 😜😜😜@jazzteamfan @utahjazz @spidadmitchell when he won the slam dunk competition. I was in Vegas walking the strip and some old guy commented on my jazz hoodie and was so pumped that Mitchell won! He said he hasn’t seen anyone jump and dunk the way Donny did that night. Cool memory.“When they was scared to get it through the Mail Man I went Utah Jazz” https://t.co/VqnH514ww3@jazzteamfan @utahjazz I remember the excitement of meeting @TheDeliverer_32 with my dad during the 1997 playoffs as we presented him his very own purple Mailman foam mailbox hat that my dad created and marketed to the Jazz! It was so cool to be 9 and look waay up at him and have him laugh at that hat#NBA75 on @TV5manila:

Our defense sucks. Care to sign a 10 day? 

Sincerely, 

Danny Ainge, Utah Jazz@jazzteamfan @utahjazz @deebrown11 My memory is not always the best... so its  possible that this was just a very realistic dream that I had... but either way, the impact it had on me was absolutely real.@jazzteamfan @utahjazz I got to play "1 on 1" with @deebrown11 for a jr jazz activity when I was like 11. It was a very small encounter but he was so kind and I felt like the coolest person in the world. It also changed the way that I experienced basketball going forward.@gvanigzalez @utahjazz @35_Fitz Love that guy@jazzteamfan @utahjazz When @Joeingles7 responded to my tweet!! 😊🤩@jazzteamfan @utahjazz So many likable Jazz team members. So many memorable moments. My current favorite is @rudygobert27    Or Jordan Clarkson.  Or @spidadmitchell   Or @Joeingles7  or Mike Conley. Or @BucketsONeale00   Or bogdanovich. Or Quin. Man. I love them all.@jazzteamfan @utahjazz @dfavors14 and his return after being gone a yearRookie Cade Cunningham’s career-high 29 points leads Detroit Pistons to another win, 126-116 over Utah Jazz https://t.co/os73ZMJWIb@Bruh_man254 @Farbod_E @utahjazz idk something like thatbought a Utah jazz jersey lol https://t.co/NogVeVT9qW@jazzteamfan @utahjazz My favorite player was @35_Fitz. Dude was the ultimate hustle guy and always gave it his all. The first moment that pops into my head is the inbound backwards tap shot as the shot clock expired. What an amazing moment.Here are some of the notable stats that have helped shape @utahjazz's season so far. | By @ryanwmcdonald
#TakeNote
https://t.co/D3iD2JvkSr@jazzteamfan @utahjazz Donovan Mitchell, put back dunk on the Rockets in the second round of the playoffsI want a Utah jazz jersey@jazzteamfan @utahjazz @spidadmitchell  winning the slam dunk contest as a rookie with the tribute to @mrvincecarter15 https://t.co/5z3JmIXUtK@jazzteamfan @utahjazz When Favs dunked on Ilysova a few seasons ago, then screamed a few choice words 😂 

I’ve never been so hyped for a Favs dunk. @dfavors14@hansen_asher @utahjazz @ZionsBank Yeah he's not terrible. But he's not great either. Doesn't fight through screens well and gets blown by quite a bit by other guards. Plus we usually hide him on their 3rd or 4th best scorer@jazzteamfan @utahjazz @AntoineCarr55 My favorite memory of him, is seeing him leave the arena after the WC finals against Seattle in his car, stopping to sign a few autographs. Meant the world to me as a teenager!@jazzteamfan @utahjazz It has to be the John Stockton 3 in Houston and Charles Barkley with his hands on his head while Coach, Karl, John, and Jeff all jumped up and down and hugged! I was 11 years old and my mom let me stay up late.. I was sobbing like a baby! It still gets me all runny eyed!The Utah Jazz hoodie told me everything I needed to know. https://t.co/WauVAxkHBu@jazzteamfan @utahjazz @TheDeliverer_32 Karl heard about it and the next day brought the kid a box full of Karl Malone signed stuff. The kid, and I,  immediately became Mailman fans! He didn't look for accolades or press. He did it to help out a kid who needed some hope. The Mailman really delivered that day!@dvnmstrs I feel like there are two different Jazz being discussed. Also that Kyle has no clue about either. 🤷🏼‍♀️

I think Devin means he wants to get married by like a Utah Jazz person. Like Jenn. 

I think Steve means I Am Jazz. 

I think Kyle is just not advising marriage. 

How’d I do?@jazzteamfan @utahjazz Growing up as a Jazz fan I had some good times at the jazz games that it's hard to pick.I think right now I'd have to say @spidadmitchelI! The reason is he's been such a great influence to the fan base here! He's always going the extra mile to make someone's Day!@jazzteamfan @utahjazz @TheDeliverer_32 Karl Malone for sure. My earliest experience with him was at Primary Children's Medical Center. He was a Rookie or Sophmore. A veteran player refused to go back one room to visit a kid who was doing a cancer treatment and missed him.@deckershimai @jazzteamfan @utahjazz @rudygobert27 Chop on!! Go Braves!@jazzteamfan @utahjazz Fave Jazz player is Bryon Russell (@BRuss3). Also (least favorite memory)…JORDAN PUSHED OFF! #TakeNote@jazzteamfan @utahjazz https://t.co/hOUcfZi9vp
Favorite memory is @DwightHoward losing a bet to me ( he can't hit 3's) and giving me his arm bands. Sorry for the bad video.@jazzteamfan @utahjazz @BucketsONeale00

Poor refs and any player who screwed up.@jazzteamfan @utahjazz @spidadmitchell blocks Hayward and his dunk vs the Lakers https://t.co/PJMY0fX9wC@BillSimmons if @danielrainge @utahjazz kept both Brown &amp; Tatum untouchable what did @BCCoachStevens learn living side by side with them in the trenches?@jazzteamfan @utahjazz Always loved John Stockton! Not sure he’s on Twitter to tag 🤷‍♂️. The ‘97 team was so well rounded including you Howard! The Jazz second rotation was the best in the league thanks to your contribution. Snuck out of my sister’s wedding to catch game 1 of the finals. 😂@jazzteamfan @utahjazz Can’t beat @rudygobert27 for me. Watching his dominance and prowess on the court, and his service in the local community as well as his home in France continues to inspire me! ❤️The Utah jazz hoodie is all I need to know about this kid https://t.co/M1invEbS8a@jazzteamfan @utahjazz I will never forget @rickyrubio9 in this game right here https://t.co/B7eYWQWtd4

The way the crowd went INSANE after he got fouled and even crazier when he raised his arms up@jazzteamfan @utahjazz @spidadmitchell Oop dunk on a half court pass on Xmas day in 2018 against the Blazers. In the first showing of the green jerseys, bought his that night.@jazzteamfan @utahjazz @dfavors14 not a specific moment but the fact he would and dunk on just about anyone he wanted to@jazzteamfan @utahjazz Headband Joe destroying the Clippers 🤷‍♂️@jazzteamfan @utahjazz Nice to see you got literally every one of y’all’s fans to comment on one post. I’m impressed@jazzteamfan @utahjazz Favorite jazz player is @spidadmitchell m. Favorite memory was when @Paulmillsap4 led us to the win against Miami in the first season of the Miami super team.I predict Utah Jazz cover the spread tomorrow night. 💵💶Tonight Talkin' Jazz @DLocke09 , with video support here, evolution of Donovan Mitchell's game🏀

That dunk made my jaw drop when I watched it for sure!@jazzteamfan @utahjazz jordan clarkson bc he was the best trade decision ever! loved when he broke the three point record 😎@thorneypucker @jazzteamfan @utahjazz @spidadmitchell Me and you with the same reply https://t.co/rXqSpzDitN@jazzteamfan @bwfanzzz @utahjazz I remember seeing @spidadmitchell at his first game at Vivint and thinking…”this guy will be a superstar”.

saw him at the Vegas airport, I was going up, he was going down the escalator. no one recognized him. I yelled, “hey Rudy!!!”
he slowly turned. and that was it☠️ https://t.co/gfTqEBbTFLWhen people look at problems with the Jazz defense, I don't think anyone should be surprised that when Rudy is missing and Ingles, there will be problems. Covid sucks. #utahjazz #TakeNote #StiffletowerTrade him to the @utahjazz https://t.co/76tkBlg9ee@utahjazz That is Copper Hills High School.

It’s been 3-hours of misery. https://t.co/2zg8z6bceG@jazzteamfan @utahjazz @spidadmitchell when he did the put back dunk against the Lakers his rookie year, I just remember thinking how lucky the Jazz were to draft him and he’s been special his whole time in the league.They just the 2021 Utah Jazz https://t.co/rFo7yQnpQV@jazzteamfan @utahjazz One of my all time favorite jazz players has to be the golden Griff! Watching him hit those sky hooks was magic on the court!@jazzteamfan @utahjazz Has to be John Stockton. I named my son after him. I got his autograph along with the rest of the Jazz when I was in 8th grade. I had his poster growing up. All the cliches you can think of. He was who I wanted to be. I got to be as tall as he was just not as good😜@f0rumspec16 @Joeingles7 @RenaeIngles @utahjazz Beyond agreed!!!!!@ClintoPete @slomalockton41 @Joeingles7 @RenaeIngles @utahjazz Send it to me!!!!!@jazzteamfan @utahjazz @bigTbailey I did!

And I say this as a Utah Jazz fan. https://t.co/QUpW9N8GnqThe Grizzlies traded Mike Conley to the Utah Jazz and then built a contender faster than the Jazz could. https://t.co/tq9Ht9Stle@jazzteamfan @utahjazz @bigTbailey This year's team...just fantastic.

But, a few years ago I tweeted @spidadmitchell to come to a high basketball game for a school that I work at. He actually came and participated in a half court shot contest. It was awesome!!!@jazzteamfan @bwfanzzz @utahjazz @spidadmitchell !! He stopped before a game two years  ago to give my son an autograph (he was 6) he talks about it to this day!!!The Memphis Grizzlies are now tied with the Utah Jazz for 3rd in the West. 2 1/2 games behind Golden State and 3.5 behind Phoenix for 1st 👀How does one get a @denzelvalentine jersey on the @utahjazz 🥺Warriors #1 defense or Utah Jazz shitty defense? Coulda fooled me.@jazzteamfan @utahjazz John Stockton is my favorite of all time.When I was about 10 I had a John Stockton shirt my mom had to pry off of me to wash. It was the only shirt I wanted to wear. I wanted to be the first girl to play for the Jazz. I finally got to meet him at his book signing,I was so giddy.@jazzteamfan @utahjazz my favorite recent memory was @rudygobert27 aggressively blocking Patrick Beverley.Even though he helped take down our team, I am happy for @ksykesyb. #utahjazz https://t.co/coCCLSHo5B@jazzteamfan @utahjazz Watching @mharpring15 battle Ron Artest in his prime.@jazzteamfan @utahjazz Hands down - @spidadmitchell for his countless visits to our local school events and always giving the youth his shoes and jerseys@jazzteamfan @utahjazz Every time @MehmetOkur13 hit a huge bucket in the clutch. Miss you Money Man!!! 💰@jazzteamfan @utahjazz Deron Williams for sure! He is what turned me into a Jazz fan.

He’s autistic and Tony made him feel like the most important person in the room. He was a really bright spot during a dark time.@utahjazz I legit thought that was a game of 'hangman' Joe was playing with a fan.@jazzteamfan @utahjazz @bigTbailey Big T Bailey, at his summer camps, he was always so great when I was a kid! “It’s better to be long than short!” Such a great guy.@jazzteamfan @utahjazz I love the spida! @spidadmitchell@jazzteamfan @utahjazz @spidadmitchell his put back dunk against the lakers his rookie year!

 #utahjazz #TakeNote #cavs #BeTheFight https://t.co/5ujndoNOMB@jazzteamfan @utahjazz Would love to see my favorite player (@rudygobert27 ) when he returns to action. Loved when he'd salute after a dunk in the past! It would be awesome if he'd bring back his salute. I'm sure it would energize the fans!@jazzteamfan @utahjazz @spidadmitchell His awesome performance against the Rockets in the playoffs his rookie year! Though the Jazz Lost, we knew he was going to be special!We will show Utah Jazz how to beat the Pistons 😈@jazzteamfan @utahjazz @rudygobert27 and it was so cool him finally playing in the all star game!@jazzteamfan @utahjazz @spidadmitchell @Joeingles7 @rudygobert27 John Stockton, Karl Malone,  Jeff Hornacek, Shannon Anderson to name a few old school favorites.@jazzteamfan @utahjazz There are too many good players to name one favorite. I love @spidadmitchell , @Joeingles7 @rudygobert27 I’ll put my favorite memory as a kid. I was 11 and we were watching Game 6 of the ‘97 conference finals when John Stockton sent the Jazz to the NBA Finals!!!@adashofgold @jazzteamfan @utahjazz “Horny with the hooker from the corner, he scores!”
Did everyone say that as a kid or just me?@jazzteamfan @utahjazz I told my 6yr old son and he said, “What!? Dad, my shoes are @spidadmitchell “ 😂🤷🏼‍♂️@jazzteamfan @utahjazz @rudygobert27 going off in the all star game@jazzteamfan @utahjazz D-will him always demolishing cp3 every year@jazzteamfan @utahjazz @spidadmitchell Happy to see him playing wellHey @utahjazz  @spidadmitchell @RyanQualtrics let’s get this  dude to a Jazz game. https://t.co/qfhv7L2Qlh@sampsthechamp @spidadmitchell @RyanQualtrics @utahjazz Jacob living the Jazz highlife! Tell him I’m very jealous! Don is a great basketball player, but an even better individual. Not many, maybe zero, players would ever do this. Not to mention, after a terrible loss. Don gets it. #takenote@gwapojas @utahjazz Definitely! I’ll take it@jazzteamfan @utahjazz Can I go with Hot Rod Hundley. His game calls are forever sealed in my mind and the 🐐 in my eyes https://t.co/ashTAyLB4iAs a jazz fan it makes me sick knowing that everyone knew Desmond Bane and Saddiq Bey’s potential and the @utahjazz traded back or passed on them. Especially since the most valuable position in the game is a 3 and D wing. I also apologize for being a couch GM. https://t.co/FNsLklhLoo@jazzteamfan @utahjazz One of my favorite jazz memories is watching a rookie @spidadmitchell help lead the jazz to an upset victory over the thunder in the first round of the playoffs@utahjazz 🚨 Like if you think #JohnStockton the #GOAT point guard 🚨 https://t.co/p1qSdQGhtG@jazzteamfan @utahjazz Fave player Donovan Mitchell. Fave memory I was when I was at the playoffs against the Thunder and Ricky Rubio was draining threes and making huge plays as the Jazz lead increased and at the end of the quarter we as the crowd were chanting RU-BI-O and he raised his hands up to us@jazzteamfan @utahjazz @rickyrubio9 was such a gift while he was here. One of my fav memories is at one of his youth basketball camps and there’s a little boy in a @Joeingles7 jersey taking a shot during a drill and Ricky blocks it, because y’know, Jingles jersey. Kid gets a surprise ball to the face😂 https://t.co/OSAscJ3vY3Did anybody else just see the kid in the @utahjazz jersey at the Baylor game? #TakeNote@jazzteamfan @utahjazz Yeah I was aggressive. At least thats how I took it. Lolhome ❤️ https://t.co/ufnLs7rn97@overtime Makes sense he’s a @utahjazz fan@JazzBabyJa @utahjazz @spidadmitchell Speaking of AB’s misses, I miss that guy.@jazzteamfan @utahjazz Favorite player is @spidadmitchell and favorite memory of him is when he played through injury to try to will us through that series with the clippers. He showed true heart and tenacity.@adashofgold @utahjazz That’s awesome!
