#Pistons #BullsNation #NBA75 https://t.co/lBwP7bnTRr@27_blake @chicagobulls @2Xtremebounce I agree. Feel Pat has had a cautious start. Even the 3 he sunk towards the end of the game last night he hesitated, however with time/experience he will come good 👊Killian Hayes had his career high 21 against the Chicago Bulls and tied his career low 0 against the Chicago Bulls. He probably gets in between those tonight. Hopefully he manages to cancel out whatever Lonzo does because those two guys seemed to clamp each other last game.@runnerangie @chicagobulls Let’s goooooo!This has always been a @chicagobulls fan account anyways… everyone knows that.@thesurovijr @chicagobulls Cringe@juicy_josue @chicagobulls We there Thursday b 👀🤝🔴@Thebrianwoods_ @chicagobulls Don’t forget the 4 steals 2 blocks 😘@chicagobulls @akash_3.0 on instagram, he doesn’t have a twitter.

The Bulls are the flipside of the Knicks and will win a ton of games based on its O.

I'm not sure if they can beat the good, disciplined defense's but they will beat up bad teams

They just whacked NOP 128-112 with its O firepower. https://t.co/h8qYDT4RZO@chicagobulls @jskribbles I have yet to experience a professional basketball game up close@hashtag_ry @chicagobulls I'd love to witness a 5 pt 3 rebound 2 assist game 😫@2Xtremebounce @chicagobulls Javonte A Caruso creates havoc out there making things happen defensively oh Zo too.

These are the easy games. These are the teams this team should be beating. I'm more interested our record from 10/30-11/19.

#BullsNation@chicagobulls @NBCSChicago @670TheScore Wish I could go 😭. Tickets are so expensive and they will only rise if we do good (which I want us to do good)The Chicago Bulls can really be a threat to some of the top teams in the East. They have bucket getters and their suffocating defense can really cause problems. 

Zach LaVine has established himself as one of the best in the game. You can tell he wants more.

We are only two games in. https://t.co/5YxiWFf6ur@Gray_Ry @chicagobulls @ZO2_ love vuc but it seems that his rebounding average is misleading. He gets lots of Rebs of his own misses but he rarely gets a BIG board. I think the pressure and role put on Williams to guard the best wing last year that he doesn’t do this year leads to him being a 8-10 reb guy.Lonzo Ball is the greatest Chicago Bull of all time. Caruso is no. 2@FateTonali @Ranier7Sicat @chicagobulls @NBCSChicago @ACFresh21 Didn't y'all hate on Lonzo and BI 😂The Chicago Bulls. Yup. 👌🏾@chicagobulls I'll be there on Feb!Chicago Bulls playoff bound for sure@FrankLi @chicagobulls @NBCSChicago @ACFresh21 Lonzo was great tonight.

I was 10 when the last dance finished. On the other hand, being a kid and looking up to MJ was incredible. He was everyone’s idol.

The Chicago Bulls gonna be a championship contender very soon.@TrulyCoco_ @chicagobulls @ChitoGaminYT @ZO2_ They might be, but it would be an interesting match up. Long wing players with speed against a physical inside out team. I think it would come down to transition defense by the Knicks and paint defense by the Bulls.Looks like the @chicagobulls are back with 2-0 start.

He comes off the bench, which is often why the +/- is low.@chicagobulls have the potential to be NICE.@BearsFan_1997 @chicagobulls I agree. But honestly not many people can shut Giannis down. The best they might be able to do is slow him down enough to force someone else to beat them.

Can you imagine Rose/Levine/Lonzo/DeRozen/Vucc AS OUR STARTING FIVE?!!!!#SeeRed lets go boys @chicagobulls  #BullsNation@SmokinTreesDra1 @chicagobulls I am, but I grew up going to the old Chicago stadium and United center a lot to see that dynasty. After that, it’s so hard for the Bulls to inspire me. I was lucky bc I had a family ticket connection to see MJ. It’s just different for me🤷‍♂️@chicagobulls @ACFresh21 🤩 the presentation tho

When is Ye gonna be at the UC next. I’ll be there@chicagobulls @NBCSChicago @ZachLaVine This guy gets it 👏@Dylan_leeper i can only speak for the bulls [and maybe justin fields], but my take on it would be that the U.C./Bulls management and Soldier Field/Bears management are far from comparable. Stratospheres apart. If the Bears leave, it just means Chicago belongs to the Bulls even more then. 😊@chicagobulls @goaawol Fingers crossed 🤞🏾@chicagobulls @NBCSChicago @ZachLaVine Look at the future MVP, so inspirational #BullsNation https://t.co/4i6ipEbfry@chicagobulls @NBCSChicago @ZachLaVine i don't see knicks fans anywhere in this clip@27_blake @chicagobulls @ZachLaVine Great Jersey!
