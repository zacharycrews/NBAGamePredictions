It was OBVIOUS before the MRI that Poole had nothing to do with morant's knee problems. The MRI merely ''seals the deal''. morant missed 8+- games in April due to..... Bingo! His RIGHT knee. Get a grip jenkins; everyone knows (who knows BB) that YOU overplayed morant(cont)@Dentonwx @memgrizz Go GrizzliesIf @espn and @NBATV could STOP showing the SLIGHT pull on the knee from Poole on @JaMorant that would be great. You don‚Äôt get a bone bruise (which @memgrizz knew about after game 3 but didn‚Äôt reveal til after game 4) from a slight pull of the knee while making a play on the ball.Stephen Curry and the Golden State Warriors look to end the series against Jaren Jackson Jr.'s Memphis Grizzlies üí£

Why‚Äôd you all keep coming back to making this a blame game instead of bball? Besides it was GP2 who brooks injured on purpose Ja did this to himself in a prior play he just too proud to admit it. Same as Jenkins. Eww@BontaHill They hav a very good team but I think they‚Äôve been operating under an illusion since the play-in we‚Äôll see how it goes but if they thought they were gonna easily take out GS ‚Ä¶they better ask somebody eg Darryl Morley, Sam Presti @NBAonTNT @memgrizz@GrizzliesPR @memgrizz Your team has been dirty the whole  series.  Then your coach blamed a player unfairly, clearly Poole had nothing to do with the injury (unlike that cheap shot against GP2).
