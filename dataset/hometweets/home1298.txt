📝Preview: https://t.co/Khl3j0Tx6Q https://t.co/KvTyzMg3eH@memphisnews @mgiannotto @memgrizz O yes, Gm 1 Grizz loss is ALL on morant with his CHOKE final play.  And Gm 3 Grizz BLOWOUT; GS was smearing Grizz WITH morant playing. morant though flashy, is self destructing due to his style of play, just like D.RoseI would celebrate like this on @memgrizz court FOSHO after the way they weak ass coach, team and fans bitched and whined about every LITTLE thing.

The Warriors won’t do that because this ain’t new to them but they SHOULD.

Been trying to get outside my comfort zone@GrizzShowYo @Rjeff24 @memgrizz cry maybe you will make it out the 2nd round next year@memphisnews @mgiannotto @memgrizz Bravo. It was OBVIOUS before the MRI that Poole had nothing to do with morant's knee problems. The MRI merely ''seals the deal''. morant missed 8+- games in April due to..... Bingo! His RIGHT knee. Get a grip jenkins; everyone knows (who knows BB) that YOU overplayed morant(cont)@Dentonwx @memgrizz Go GrizzliesIf @espn and @NBATV could STOP showing the SLIGHT pull on the knee from Poole on @JaMorant that would be great. You don’t get a bone bruise (which @memgrizz knew about after game 3 but didn’t reveal til after game 4) from a slight pull of the knee while making a play on the ball.Stephen Curry and the Golden State Warriors look to end the series against Jaren Jackson Jr.'s Memphis Grizzlies 💣

#ImNeverWrongOne Last Dance! @memgrizzRewatching Game 4 of the Memphis Grizzlies versus the Golden State Warriors, our energy and execution to start games is disconcerting.

Perhaps I am rooting for the wrong team because this has always been ingrained in the Stephen Curry-led Warriors' DNA, but we are so sloppy.@memgrizz @FedEx Lol no way. 😂@mbwkrause @GrizzliesPR @memgrizz We don’t need no apology. Karma is their apology. Stop pointing fingers and accept reality.  WARRIORS got HEART and CLASS. We keep it movin and WINI know you lyin'. Absolutely NOT 😤😤😤

And a great job of winning your other 2 with KD. Championships don’t mean nothing if it ain’t wholesome, but do yalls thing keep winning that way. 1 chip every 50 years earned is better than 3 BS@RamsHouse4Ever @GrizzliesPR @memgrizz Luck has nothing to do with it. Game 4 was given to the Warriors. Inexperience cost them the game not LUCK!! Ja being out…a fluke. But you don’t disrespect the game or players due to your ego. Plain and simpleThe butt hurt in Memphis Grizzlies twitter is immense. https://t.co/4Z3nkc3zOb@JaMorant has been a difference maker in this series but he missed game 4 and looks likely to miss more time in. Can @memgrizz slow the @warriors and push them to a game 6 and 7? 

Find out what our NBA Expert @TillJam3 has to say: https://t.co/kpCzGEaoyO https://t.co/UaabSyWL7g@energy_pick @GrizzliesPR @memgrizz It happens to most teams.

Next man up is all that means finger pointing is for kids@WarPigsNWA @memgrizz @JaMorant Understood. But I’m going for Memphis. I’m a Grizzlies fan.

Also their sad coach Jenkins knew Morant had a bone bruise but kept it a secret to try to get Poole suspended even though it wasn’t him. That’s just an embarrassing POS.@memgrizz We are already in the house #Goldblooded warriors ✍️🔥@sinnerward @GrizzliesPR @memgrizz Warriors were beating the trash Grizzlies anyways.

Poole was not stabilizing himself by pulling laterally on Ja's knee.The Memphis Grizzlies have never lost a Game 5 at home.@ONoSheWentThere @ShamsCharania @memgrizz That’s my overall point! It’s a physical playoff game for all the chips!They are all competing hard at the highest level. The NBA is a brotherhood at its core &amp; they all try and protect each other ultimately!

Why’d you all keep coming back to making this a blame game instead of bball? Besides it was GP2 who brooks injured on purpose Ja did this to himself in a prior play he just too proud to admit it. Same as Jenkins. Eww@BontaHill They hav a very good team but I think they’ve been operating under an illusion since the play-in we’ll see how it goes but if they thought they were gonna easily take out GS …they better ask somebody eg Darryl Morley, Sam Presti @NBAonTNT @memgrizz@GrizzliesPR @memgrizz Your team has been dirty the whole  series.  Then your coach blamed a player unfairly, clearly Poole had nothing to do with the injury (unlike that cheap shot against GP2).  Now would be a good time to apologize to Poole and the Warriors.On the All-Time @memgrizz NBA scoring list, Dillon Brooks moved into 6th, passing @paugasol with 243 points for his career.

#NBATwitter #GrzNxtGen@LMarwick @GrizzliesPR @memgrizz Of course he won’t! That clown can’t own up to anything. Still making excuses game after game after game. Anyone still take him seriously? Sad this guy.@LilBit071213 @JaMorant @memgrizz Yea exactly. He missed 1/4 of the season. Plus he’s a high flyerIn last night's game, @jarenjacksonjr moved into 8th on the All-Time @memgrizz scoring list, passing O.J. Mayo and @CourtneyLee5 with 217 playoff points for his career.

#NBATwitter #GrzNxtGen@ILove_theArts @sufisadboy @sinnerward @DylanViincent @GrizzliesPR @memgrizz It’s basketball! That’s a whiny ass excuse. Wtf you want zero contact? Zero physicality? Everybody has to have 3ft of space. If that minor contact injured you then that’s on you. Maybe he should go play Baseball. It’s unfortunate he got hurt, but no one is to blame for that.@CarlitoSzn @TreymondGreen @memgrizz warriors blew em out by 30 WITH ja playing 💀@Ludog9 @GrizzliesPR @ShaynaRubin @memgrizz @warriors Your mind doesn’t seem to follow logic so let me simplify it. Jenkins said there was a tug, which may or may not have caused the injury. He would go back and watch the film, and was curious to see if the tug was indeed the cause. This was before the MRI.@memgrizz @1Tyus @MercuryPrinting Happy birthday@memgrizz @1Tyus Happy birthday@karmamar55 @GrizzliesPR @memgrizz Why should Ja do that he didn't do shit
