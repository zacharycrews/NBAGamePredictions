The reigning defending undisputed world champions! https://t.co/GV0gyVIyHZOk we won against the wolves. But what r we doing to do when good offensive teams run these same defensive schemes on us? Box and 1 on Kd and make the others beat you. This is a huge problem. Joe would solve some of it but if we get the Milwaukee bucks Joe, then we r done.HERE'S WHAT'S NEXT

He's Very Inconsistent just look @ his tract records. He hasn't been rgt since his Portland Days B4 his injury!@thibabros @JetJMP @__zn30 @Bucks The Cavs have a better young core than the Knicks. Kevin love is having a great season and has been a great presence. Knicks would kill for veterans like Rubio and Love. If Barrett doesn’t work out.. where are the Knicks?

They have a lot, to work on; at practice!@starbrrst @Bucks Hell fkn no, Bledsoe sucked@JetJMP @__zn30 @JacksonPilgram @Bucks Love the players, whole lot, but unless there's trade talks or a contract buyout, Cleveland ain't noteworthy.To my #1 podcast of 2021, Locked On Bucks – Daily Podcast On The Milwaukee Bucks: thank you for keeping me company on @Spotify all year long! #SpotifyWrapped https://t.co/3XKSjnfAuJ@Bucks Bro this guy fucking sucked for us and on the Lakers. Don’t start this guy@JetJMP @__zn30 @JacksonPilgram @Bucks The Knicks have a chance against any team in the league that doesn't play defense. I think Jarret Allen Is a quality man of god and Cleveland is lucky to have him. Cleveland isn't a small market with next to no relevancy.@Bucks Home is where the heart is, welcome back Wes! ❤️ https://t.co/iawvHgBAjY@__zn30 @JacksonPilgram At the same time you need to account for perimeter defense, something me and the @thibabros have been talking about heavy. That’s why the Knicks are on the ups and the cavs are a middle of the pack team…
