#NBAGood evening from my friends house where his nine-month old is trying to bite my phone as I tweet this. Kyrie Irving is coming back to the Nets on a part-time basis. What it means for Brooklyn, Irving and everyone involved.  https://t.co/jTVp5PpJVxMy man got a part time job with the Brooklyn Nets.

Maybe you should come out of your glass house. https://t.co/Hoq34OHCvV@jetlining @fymroo the bROOklyn nets@troll_hell @botzz28 @nyyMikeM @RealMichaelKay @BrooklynNets With these particular vaccines it's not even 1 percent. Forget "not 100 percent".

And the amount of different and unique/specific antibodies the immune system can make - is a Quintillion (that's 18 zeros).@cjstep21 @BrooklynNets would you rather lose Durant for the remainder of the season to an injury??@wojespn Good luck with that @BrooklynNets. May as well stand firm on vaccine. He‚Äôs gonna get it. Multiple times maybe.@Demitustouchh @cjstep21 @BrooklynNets Ya but theyre not as sick or hospitalized or dying. Stop spreading lies@BrooklynNets The most reliable superstar player!Brooklyn does not win Championship with Kyrie this year,Nets will trade him 2022 because it didn‚Äôt work out Kyrie plying PT this year Nets can‚Äôt have a player play part time 2022@golden1az @BrooklynNets haha dude if you are that salty....

It'll only prove how complicated it is to make medicine for different ppl that has 2 work the same way. That's why no vaccine is 100% including some of the oldest ones.An awful decision by @BrooklynNets ownership - a vicious attack on New York public health.

How many different and unique/specific antibodies can the body's immune system make?@troll_hell @botzz28 @nyyMikeM @RealMichaelKay @BrooklynNets When the pandemic first started, in NYC we averaged 2/3 hundred deaths A DAY. It was all new and overwhelming to medical staff. 4/5 months in, they got a better understanding of how to care and treat covid patients - and NYC averaged 2 deaths a day - all pre-vaccines.@ifbacongrewont1 @botzz28 @nyyMikeM @RealMichaelKay @BrooklynNets I'm sure it's a lot higher than I care to count. Also since everyone is different it makes the # beyond comprehension.

You are dead wrong and Brooklyn management needs to grow some balls and recognize it‚Ä¶ GBrooklyn Nets to bring back Kyrie Irving for road games outside New York, Toronto - ESPN https://t.co/CRG7aQ400L@askthedr @BrooklynNets @NBA Absolutely. We should all have the choice of what we do with our bodies. Why is the vaccination free? Cause it saves lives? Then shouldn‚Äôt chemo be free? How about insulin? Oh well. To each his own!@BrooklynNets @SeanMarksNetsGM WEAK MOVE!!@ifbacongrewont1 @botzz28 @nyyMikeM @RealMichaelKay @BrooklynNets No it's not that simple.  That's why it takes time to develop and if it's so easy, why don't you do it? Or did you run out of ivermectin or hydroxychloroquine?@BrooklynNets This is ridiculous.  Tell the guy to get vaccinated, a simple and effective procedure during a public health crisis.  You're enabling ignorance, selfishness and irresponsible conduct.  Setting a terrible example.@BrooklynNets This some real spineless shit right here.@BrooklynNets How long until the ‚ÄúKyrie is under health and safety protocols‚Äù?OMFG YES! Kyrie is back on the NETS for road games!! #BrooklynNets@NewshubNZ They are calling this new super variant ‚ÄúThe Brooklyn Nets‚Äù@troll_hell @botzz28 @nyyMikeM @RealMichaelKay @BrooklynNets It is simple, the entire history of vaccines is all about and only about triggering an immune response, which is antibodies and B and T cells. Like frekin duh.@BrooklynNets Make sense Kyrie coaches and NBA organisations thoughts : "all the players are vaccinated and they still catch covid iam not vaccinated but I don't have Covina and I can't play too...whats the point of that?" thank GOD is Happening üèÅüèÅüèÅ@LegionHoops @BrooklynNets took you long enough@ifbacongrewont1 @botzz28 @nyyMikeM @RealMichaelKay @BrooklynNets They're being filled up by ignorant anti vaccine fools that believe tucker Carlson.

1- the vaccine is something good for everyone, it benefits everyone in general. 
2- with the vaccine, he would not be at risk of severe covid symptoms.
3- with the vaccine, he could play all the games
result: kyrie wins, nets win, we win.@BrooklynNets That's my GM!!!!!
