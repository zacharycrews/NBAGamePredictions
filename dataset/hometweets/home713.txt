@Bucks vs @cavs Preview. Are the Cavs for real? Can the Bucks repeat? #FearTheDeer #BeTheFight #GamblingTwitterI think the @cavs have a chance to trade for Bradley Beal. Could you imagine him with Garland Mobley &amp; Allen?@ManOf1003Holds @cavs Hell yeah. Such a fun team watch.

https://t.co/Djy8pJ5sCM@JamCristopher Great photo! Kennard‚Äôs body angle on the shot, as well as just the general vibe overall, reminds me of the famous shot of @Jumpman23 sticking a dagger in the @cavs years ago. Those stakes were a wee bit higher but both incredibly skilled stuff.@cavs you know what to do https://t.co/OAai3dabMT@darealja @cavs Chemistry will be less of an issue with Sexton returning than trading for a player from another team. Getting sexton back is like getting an all star caliber player without having to trade someone.Zion Williamson Mountain Dew commercial's a really bad look.

Next to Zack Lavine Zion lookin like Cleveland Cavaliers era Shawn Kemp.

As @MrCavalier34 you say about your tweets &amp; intellect "GET THAT WEAK STUFF OUTTA HERE" there you learned something else a @cavs announcer has said for YEARS!! CLASS DISMISSED!! #LetEmKnowIf @cavs can get Sexton back for the playoffs, even if it's in limited minutes off the bench, it would be huge, not only in terms of what he brings on the court, bit also emotionally for this team. https://t.co/R9CvRZecT2I do not care how little he would cost. I want no part of Dennis Schroder on the Cleveland Cavaliers.Oh these tears are so delicious. üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ

 #SalsNBL @SkySport @nznbl https://t.co/Nyf3LPAisII don't understand the outrage here. I mean, it's a Cleveland Cavaliers broadcast on their local network, and are paid by the team.

All of the guys were so close, they had a group chat of all of them that they talked in everyday and some still do. They said they didn‚Äôt care about he regular season they didn‚Äôt start trying until the playoffs.disagree with what u sayinDarius Garland is in there with some elite players. It has been great watching him each nite the last 3 years. He has improved all parts his game immensely. Such a good shooter but his ability to facilitate &amp; control the offense. Now a young leader of the Cleveland Cavaliers. https://t.co/N4HVhMsjq8 https://t.co/PSX7O5EzgLTobias Harris had 33/11 @SacramentoKings @cavs @spurs @celtics @WashWizards @BrooklynNets@cavs @kevinlove Happy 4love.

Now you question whether you‚Äôd have Sexton or Ingram. That one, I don‚Äôt know yet. That‚Äôs tough.@cavs @kevinlove My guy‚ù§Ô∏è @kevinlove@crouch___ @cavs I‚Äôd prefer to keep Okoro to Sexton, and one of them will definitely have to be a part of any potential Ingram trade. Also Okoro  is same age as Mobley and Sexton is due a contract.I wish the @cavs were playing tonight...
