Those stakes were a wee bit higher but both incredibly skilled stuff.@cavs you know what to do https://t.co/OAai3dabMT@darealja @cavs Chemistry will be less of an issue with Sexton returning than trading for a player from another team. Getting sexton back is like getting an all star caliber player without having to trade someone.Zion Williamson Mountain Dew commercial's a really bad look.

Next to Zack Lavine Zion lookin like Cleveland Cavaliers era Shawn Kemp.

 #SalsNBL @SkySport @nznbl https://t.co/Nyf3LPAisII don't understand the outrage here. I mean, it's a Cleveland Cavaliers broadcast on their local network, and are paid by the team. Also, they both played for the organization, and I repeat, ARE ON THE CLEVELAND CAVALIERS BROADCAST... https://t.co/iVWklEeiUj@Lakers suck @cavs have better players and better chemistry@robrigglez @life_cavs @JAC0BDEGR0M @cavs I’m other words yes it was@robrigglez @life_cavs @JAC0BDEGR0M @cavs Kevin love is notorious for not showing up in the playoffs shunpert wasn’t on the team jeff green averaged 27% from the field in the finals Jordan Clarkson averaged 23% from the field in the finals and only played half of the finals korver was very nice for usRandom former Cleveland Cavaliers Player.

All of the guys were so close, they had a group chat of all of them that they talked in everyday and some still do. They said they didn’t care about he regular season they didn’t start trying until the playoffs.disagree with what u sayinDarius Garland is in there with some elite players. It has been great watching him each nite the last 3 years. He has improved all parts his game immensely. Such a good shooter but his ability to facilitate &amp; control the offense. Now a young leader of the Cleveland Cavaliers. https://t.co/N4HVhMsjq8 https://t.co/PSX7O5EzgLTobias Harris had 33/11 @SacramentoKings @cavs @spurs @celtics @WashWizards @BrooklynNets@cavs @kevinlove Happy 4love. He seems 2b really loving2play&amp;I think it's a big reason y cavs r where they r right now.  Keep on balling love!!@smartsportsguy @cavs Good point. It would probably be Sexton. Now you question whether you’d have Sexton or Ingram. That one, I don’t know yet. That’s tough.@cavs @kevinlove My guy❤️ @kevinlove@crouch___ @cavs I’d prefer to keep Okoro to Sexton, and one of them will definitely have to be a part of any potential Ingram trade. Also Okoro  is same age as Mobley and Sexton is due a contract.I wish the @cavs were playing tonight...

However, if he’s not 100% healthy then I’d wait until the next season. Don’t risk him to miss another year. #LetEmKnow@cavs @ChaseDownPod @SerenaWinters @BallySportsCLE That story about Garland on the plane was so wholesome 😭 Next guest is going to need to fill some pretty big shoes after this oneI'd love this for @cavs https://t.co/K76g4EKxZy@cavs are playing so good, Lebron might stay in Cleveland after the all star game😂😂😂How u laugh at somebody who made your organization relevant? Lmao @cavs forever gonn be a G-League team https://t.co/Ar4wXUwHMz@OHsVeryOwn @WindhorstESPN He should also get on @BallySportsCLE and get them to make deals with streaming services! Unfortunately I cannot watch the exciting @cavs team since Ballys isn't available on @YouTubeTV !!!@cavs @ClevelandClinic Great post. Thanks for sharing@cavs @ChaseDownPod @SerenaWinters @BallySportsCLE The biggest issue with a BI trade tho I think is making sure you don’t dig yourself a hole for the future and make sure u have enough money for a garland max and Mobley maxRandom former Cleveland Cavaliers player.
