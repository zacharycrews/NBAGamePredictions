@hornets #AllFly #NBA #NBAAIIStar @MELOD1P https://t.co/AMPj8QoluI@hornets 💜Harrell w hornets match made in heaven my opinion some of the passes he made last night were a sign that’s where he should beICYMI: @hornets GM Mitch Kupchak joined @KyleBaileyClub yesterday on the @ClubhouseKB as he went into why Charlotte traded for Montrezl Harrell, and what he makes of the team as a whole near the All-Star break.

Full Interview: https://t.co/MmlbXqmiaLJust amazing to see the energy, toughness and instant impact @MONSTATREZZ gave @hornets last night! Dude is 🔥🔥 in the paint. Like a rising tide lifting all boats especially @T_Rozzay3! Even Plumlee seemed inspired. Let’s see more a that tonight!!

 https://t.co/zIfsrPG4mf?@AMP_FIELDVISION @hornets @MONSTATREZZ That’s not an enforcer. Nobody in the league is scared to go into the paint vs him. He’s totally undersized. I like his grit and shit but enforcer wouldn’t be how I describe him@NonchalantRell @AMP_FIELDVISION @AJ_Capalxt @hornets @MONSTATREZZ You’re not making ANY valid points and then said “obviously” after.

#AllFly | @hornets https://t.co/H9gkaqKl5H@hornets @NewAmsterdam Montrezl is a great fit for many reasons. He brings toughest, shot blocking ability (7'4" wingspan at 6'7"), athletic as he'll and inside scoring. He's a dominant inside scorer for when the team is experiencing games where the 3-pointers aren't falling. We are a better team!"He just gave us a great jolt of confidence and joy tonight."

Visit https://t.co/K9jJDOGggl for other updates. https://t.co/wnODbXv8oT@camutdforever @hornets @NewAmsterdam In all honesty as much as I dislike Plumlee I think Trezz fits the bench much better. Mainly for options since I much prefer PJ running the 4 as oppose to being an undersized 5. Trezz is also undersized but he has the strength of a 5 so he makes up for itGame 56 vs. Charlotte Hornets.

Another pretty bad game, but a lot of the young guys played well. Good stuff from Saddiq, Isaiah, Hami and Killian.

It was good to have Cade back, too.

The previous high was 77 points, which occurred on 1/17/2018 against the Washington Wizards. https://t.co/Xypte9aV70@hornets It’s the pistons but good to see a big lead at the end of the half and not losing.

#AllFly https://t.co/BLVCntS6vL.@hornets 79 first half points are the second most points in any half in franchise history. Charlotte set the franchise record for points in a half earlier this season with 87 points in the second half at IND on 1/26.

Certainly plenty of that in the 1st half@Bfranklez @LouisvilleMBB @hornets I guess we’ll take it. 😉Sign Trezz to an extension now @hornets !! 😂💯.@hornets are up, 79-55, at DET to set the franchise record for most points in H1.
