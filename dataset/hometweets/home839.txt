#AllFly | @hornets https://t.co/H9gkaqKl5H@hornets @NewAmsterdam Montrezl is a great fit for many reasons. He brings toughest, shot blocking ability (7'4" wingspan at 6'7"), athletic as he'll and inside scoring. He's a dominant inside scorer for when the team is experiencing games where the 3-pointers aren't falling. We are a better team!"He just gave us a great jolt of confidence and joy tonight."

Visit https://t.co/K9jJDOGggl for other updates. https://t.co/wnODbXv8oT@camutdforever @hornets @NewAmsterdam In all honesty as much as I dislike Plumlee I think Trezz fits the bench much better. Mainly for options since I much prefer PJ running the 4 as oppose to being an undersized 5. Trezz is also undersized but he has the strength of a 5 so he makes up for itGame 56 vs. Charlotte Hornets.

Another pretty bad game, but a lot of the young guys played well. Good stuff from Saddiq, Isaiah, Hami and Killian.

It was good to have Cade back, too.
