Everyone would love that people want to look at the sun@TheMisterMarcus I’m from Phoenix so I love Suns anything 😂😂I am begging all NBA GMs to understand that any call regarding trading Deandre Ayton from the Phoenix Suns is just a petty attempt from Sarver to tear down the organization on his way out and is not a legitimate offer.WE ARE ON TRACK!!
