Defense is close, Jokic's got tons of game winning blocks and OPFG% is really low for how many shots he defends. Jokic also clobbered the Bucks in Milwaukee@Bucks @JordanNwora Wow! Go Jordan 💜@Space_Ruin @Bucks But the people that paid for those tickets and are taking there kids to see Giannis believe me the kids don’t care about a championship and I can understand it but I don’t like it.

As of right now Kareem is the best Milwaukee buck but Giannis is the greatest Milwaukee Buck. When it all said and done Giannis will be the best and greatest Milwaukee buck ever.@Bucks @Hoophall you should honor him by bringing back those warm up pants.Eastern Play in:

Cavs beat Brookyln 
Brooklyn beats whoever.
Brookyln beats all teams up until
Conference and loses to Milwaukee. 

Bucks repeat champions. 

KD is nice but I think it’s just the Bucks time. Similar to how it was randomly the Warriors time.

Not a big fan of Karl@Bucks @CoachKarl22 @Hoophall He ran Ray Allen out of town sadlyCongratulations to @CoachKarl22 on being named a member of the #22HoopClass!!

George Karl served as the Head Coach of the Bucks from 1998-2003. https://t.co/DzObvYK7zO@al_quartemont @Bucks Truth!@Bucks @Hoophall As an loyal Bucks fan, i have to be honest. Giannis is nothing more than a 7 foot foul merchant that have no basketball skills. It would best for our franchise if we traded  him to golden state, so our team will finally become competitive again.Supporting our children is a topline concern of mine, so I appreciate @mkerec @MilwaukeeMPS &amp; all that they do. Working together to build a strong community &amp; #basketball skills helps out #milwaukee, our schools, youth and world champion @bucks!

The guy didn’t reference anyone else on the Bucks so I decided not to either. Hope that clears things up! 👍🏾@BleacherReport I'm a Milwaukee bucks fan but wtf@_Elove4 @itsjwills If it wasn’t for Giannis the bucks wouldn’t be in Milwaukee. He single handedly transform the Milwaukee bucks economy made this franchise top tier.
