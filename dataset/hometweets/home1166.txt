I lost out in that exchange.@Bucks @GraysonJAllen @pconnaughton We love you GraysonOchai Agbaji is literally the perfect fit for the Milwaukee Bucks. I wish he would slide to them. Match made in heavenMost games this season reaching 50+ total rebounds:

1.  Memphis Grizzlies - 45
2. Milwaukee Bucks - 28
3. Boston Celtics -27
4. Phoenix Suns - 27

Grizzlies are 38-7 when they hit 50+ TRB. 

Grizzlies did it in 23 games last season vs 45 this seasonHoping to take my lil man to a @Bucks game very soon! Maybe playoffs!

George Karl served as the Head Coach of the Bucks from 1998-2003. https://t.co/DzObvYK7zO@al_quartemont @Bucks Truth!@Bucks @Hoophall As an loyal Bucks fan, i have to be honest. Giannis is nothing more than a 7 foot foul merchant that have no basketball skills. It would best for our franchise if we traded  him to golden state, so our team will finally become competitive again.Supporting our children is a topline concern of mine, so I appreciate @mkerec @MilwaukeeMPS &amp; all that they do.
