https://t.co/W3dS6uHHRtIf the @hornets don't stop playing and don't go get Myles Turner I'ma flash he fits so perfect for the team 😭For those of you completely unfamiliar with what’s going on between the Predators/Red Wings, I’ll put it in NBA and NFL terms. The Predators (Charlotte Hornets/ NY Jets) are trying to talk trash to the Red Wings (LA Lakers/ NE Patriots) and it’s going about as well as you’d thinkCharlotte Hornets - Philadelphia 76ers

The one piece they are currently missing is a big who can patrol the paint on defense.
