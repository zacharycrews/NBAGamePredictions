I'm not sure I can watch the Jazz the same without you.    #joeinglesforeverUtah@BONEOHFIVE @JoshRWilliams4 @SacramentoKings @utahjazz I think Barnes would be a starter for the Jazz &amp; Clarkson is a bench player. Plus Utah has enough scoring at the guard spot w Donovan &amp; Conley &amp; could really use the length, defense, &amp; 3 point shooting Barnes can provide. If the Jazz could switch that, I think they should imoI feel that the @utahjazz did @Joeingles7 extremely dirty. Just hurts.@Joeingles7 From an Australian and @utahjazz fan thanks for doing both country and team proud.

If you are looking for a defensive guard who can also add some scoring. I am an unrestricted free agent and happen to be averaging 33 ppg in my churchball league so far this season.

Trade Ingles if it gets someone who can help you. Don't dump Ingles and some 2nd rounders for a bunch of scrubs.The Utah Jazz sent out two future 2nd round picks and an expiring contract, for NAW who has awesome upside, but this deal does not help right now, and it also hinders your ability to get future assets. #TakeNoteIdk why the @utahjazz did this makes no sense lol https://t.co/yghQhJrVO5Utah Jazz not winning a championship, Mitchell gone end up leaving ..It'll be weird seeing Ingles in a jersey other than a @utahjazz one. https://t.co/T2LSltP8zvJoe Ingles time with Utah temporarily comes to an end as he is traded to Portland.

The record would stand for more than a decade. https://t.co/9sHh8AI21L@calebturner23 @WorldWideWob @utahjazz @nyknicks He does that a lot. It's kind of fun and funny.

Reason being: Kris Middleton overrated as hell and y'all won't let Giannis nut sack get a  breather.Makes too much sense for the Utah Jazz, with their absolutely minimal (aka unrealistic) tools to improve the roster, to not deal Ingles and those limited 2nd round picks to Portland (exception), OKC (cap space), or Orlando (exception) to save $20+ million in luxury tax paymentsWho Will The Utah Jazz Sign In Free Agency? https://t.co/negJLOYlLpThe Golden State Warriors are on the verge of claiming their 10th straight win in the NBA, but they must take on Donovan Mitchell and the resurgent Utah Jazz.

We both go to school so our money goes to that.  She has only been to a few games and I’d I’ve to show her what it’s like being up close to the court and the game. The Utah Jazz are the best!@utahjazzman47 Put Neemus in that trade as backup for Rudy. Think of the all the  blocks the @utahjazz would get! 😳👍 on @YouTube: New York Knicks vs Utah Jazz Post Game Show (REPLAY) https://t.co/T5FCuh3WLd@utahjazz @nayocampbell Definitely wanna try Sauce Boss now@Dunzod Would be an incredible date night, so we can both get crazy for the @utahjazz !!!Cleveland Cavaliers - San Antonio Spurs
Charlotte Hornets - Chicago Bulls
Utah Jazz - Golden State Warriors
Portland Trail Blazers - Los Angeles Lakers

Bet slip link: https://t.co/G0QG6IO334 https://t.co/z8H6PNhkX5The Utah #Jazz remain among teams to watch in trade discussions for #Kings forward Harrison Barnes, per league source. Sacramento is likely not done ahead of the deadline.@Dunzod We will be celebrating our 14th wedding anniversary and it would be awesome to celebrate up close with the Utah Jazz.@calebturner23 @WorldWideWob @utahjazz @nyknicks @abefinessse @mahinalam4  LMFAOOOOOOOOO NAHHHHHHH WHAT@haydennielsen18 @Joeingles7 I just love Joe Ingles and his family! Love what he has done for the autism community! He is just the best guy! Just a great guy on and off the basketball court! Such a great influence to our young people! Love watching him play for our Utah Jazz! Especially those 3 point shots!Utah Jazz coach Quin Snyder: have the authorities dug up his backyard yet? https://t.co/6Yu8tD8Wg9The Utah Jazz shouldn't be looking to replace the Joe Ingles minutes with a similar type of player. They need to replace him with a player more in the mold of Eric Paschall. If they don't trade for a better version of what Paschall brings then Paschall should be in that spot.Alexa.. play i don’t want my @utahjazz boys to be traded.  #TakeNote@DevinCow The @utahjazz winning a chip.@utahjazz I need my Rudy back. I hope Friday. 🙏@elars777 @spidadmitchell @utahjazz Beautiful kidsIf they play the way they played the Utah Jazz. They have a chance to win. No stops at all. More on turnovers. @Lakers @LakersNation@elars777 @spidadmitchell @utahjazz Love it 🤘 Also I need those darkmode socks 😅@spidadmitchell and the @utahjazz properly represented at the larsen home. #TakeNote #NBA #basketball #Fans https://t.co/lXRmrGpYM8@utahjazz Probably the only Jazz player that put on a Jr Jazz clinic in Tabiona@utahjazz Maybe Ostertag also@utahjazz Rip down the Stockton and Malone statues and put one of Jerry, Mark Eaton and Hot Rod instead.@isaacappelt @Suns @warriors @memgrizz @MiamiHEAT @Bucks @chicagobulls @cavs @utahjazz @sixers @Raptors @celtics @nuggets @BrooklynNets @Timberwolves @hornets @LAClippers @Lakers @ATLHawks @WashWizards @nyknicks @PelicansNBA @trailblazers @spurs @SacramentoKings Snubbed from All star game😢🏀🍿🍦🎉 = Ford Fan Zone

They seem like very "Jazz-type", under the radar trades or choices that may pay nice dividends as you point out. We'll see....The Dallas Mavericks are a season-high 9 games over .500, and just 1.5 games behind the Utah Jazz for 4th in the Western Conference.

They are now 17-6 in their last 23 games, dating back to just after Christmas.Joe Ingles is the best Twitter Troll of all time. I pretty much believed him. Dude.

There were so many people who asked, it was incredibly difficult to choose. Thank you to all the new followers. This happens fairly regularly so keep following for the next time. #UtahJazz #TakeNote@phillycheeze_ @m_bilal35 He was a net neutral against the 2021 Utah Jazz, who are one of the best teams ever. The Clippers didn’t have to find an alternative because Zubac was bad, Lue rather figured out the Jazz couldn’t guard the perimeter and put out 5 perimeter players@Bucks @sixers @chicagobulls @Lakers @nyknicks @DetroitPistons @memgrizz @SacramentoKings @Pacers @warriors @trailblazers @WashWizards @spurs @utahjazz @hornets @PelicansNBA @Raptors @Suns @celtics @MiamiHEAT @cavs @dallasmavs @LAClippers any of yall want Christian Wood?And because it is just organized sport - you’re not born destined to be a Chicago Bull or Utah Jazz or St Louis Blue. You end up where the best opportunities lie. 

The mirror we should look at is why athletes don’t choose to represent US by default anymore.It's Chuck-a-Rama. You see the fresh crab get dropped up front. Nobody looking. You decide to hold steady at the Lucky Charms dispenser. This is my Utah Jazz one act play. #TakeNote https://t.co/neh39GVzoP@calebturner23 @WorldWideWob @utahjazz @nyknicks Thought their mascot would be like a saxophone or somethingI have tried to reach out to the first selection. No response. Awaiting response from next. They have under 10 minutes to respond. 😅 #UtahJazzA Buckets O'Neale @HOMAGE T-shirt at the @jazzteamstore? 👀 Yes, pls.
