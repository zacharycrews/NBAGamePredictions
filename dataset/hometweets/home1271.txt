Memphis just needs to be one-half of their regular season selves to win this series.

I don’t know if they will, but that’s what they need.@ant_manftw @LegsESPN @Timberwolves @memgrizz @JaMorant Game 1 was pretty explosive.

-@MiamiHEAT should be plenty motivated to closeout the series at home
-@memgrizz do NOT want to go back to Minnesota down 3-2
-Stole the 2 hockey picks from @UM_ThoseWhoStay's POTD that I posted earlier https://t.co/FDOHjPqgP4Tonight, the Memphis Grizzlies will play their most important basketball game since 2015–the last time they were contenders. 

I wrote about the importance of this Memphis moment, and how Ja Morant and Jaren Jackson Jr. must rise to this occasion.

https://t.co/31qQK2uTn3@Ayden_eth @ThePossessedNFT @MiamiHEAT @memgrizz @Suns Gonna be tough to rebound from Embiid's injury, but personally I still like them to win the east, it's going to be a tough road though!@memgrizz pls let Pat Bev shoot all the 3's he wants tonight.
Do not bite on pump fakes, stick with KAT &amp; Ant when PB drives &amp; make him beat us.
If PB hangs 30+ i'll take the L but the mf has never done that, esp not in the #NBAPlayoffs
I mean...wtf are we doing???

#NBATwitter@LegsESPN @Timberwolves @memgrizz @JaMorant bottled up with two triple-doubles...maybe it was just KAT illegally kneeing the absolute crap out of his thigh.

Collin Sexton was regarded as the guy, Garland was considered more of a distributor.

Ingram went from an okay scorer who had turnover issues to an all-star, Ja went from a borderline all-star to an all-NBA player.@Garbonzone @NBA @JaMorant @memgrizz Maybe because Ja is in his third year and Luka was in his second??

He has improved as a defender also, propelling his team to a 2 seed. Not to say the other finalists wouldn't be deserving but to say Ja doesn't deserve it is crazy.

This just marketing@GoalieWilli @CavsandBamaSzn @FadeAwayLeBron @espn @JaMorant @memgrizz It’s funny because people thought Ja was snubbed from the all star game his rookie year.

Also was first option while curry was out, ja averaged 8 more points, .3 more steals and 1.7 more boardsI want to go to the Memphis Grizzlies game just to see a protester get tackled and escorted out the building. Does that make me a bad person?@dfocusstyle @NBA @JaMorant @memgrizz ChildJamel Morant @JaMorant deserves this award.

@JaMorant | @memgrizz https://t.co/CM9auZaNPJ@DylanFrew6 @espn @JaMorant @memgrizz Ja has literally been carried by Desmond Bane in this playoffs, in the regular season Bane nearly doubled his ppg from last year and raised his numbers in all other stats, Poole deserved it but Ja doesn’t even deserve it over a guy like Bane@Efeso1001 @WashedLuka @NBA @JaMorant @memgrizz Tyrese also increased his averages by 8 as wel as his shooting splits improved, most notable his three (29% to 43%).@CuttyQ10 @buythespike @NBAPR @wojespn @memgrizz @NBA I just love hoops, man.

And he's been on the correct trajectory for a player drafted #2 that would have been #1 in most years. Just doesn't make sense to me. Murray is 100% the prototype for MIP !@WashedLuka @NBA @JaMorant @memgrizz It was pretty easily JP. Was in the gleague while getting less minutes than Brad Wanamaker.

I’m being bias to the guys who lifted their teams to higher seeds and still playing, though.@espn @JaMorant @memgrizz What a complete joke, over Poole? He’s not even the most improved on his own team

Ja was on the all nba team last year, how can he be “most improved”? Nba just wanted to give one of the new “faces of the league” an award for exposure

More proof these awards are fraudulent@MTownMade @tylerwolo0 @verney_ryan @Ic3yHurts @NBAPR @wojespn @memgrizz @NBA When did I criticize ja in any way ..the hell you smoking ?
