If the Raptors finish 7th and have to play the Nets in a play-in game, should they try to forfeit the home date so they can play in Brooklyn? Kyrie wouldn’t be able to play and could change the face of that game.

Kyrie Irving (60 PTS, 20-31 FG), Kevin Durant (19 PTS, 7 ASTS) &amp; the Nets win in a dominant manner. Orlando didn’t even get the chance to capture a lead.

Too many new franchise records to count so let's just do the main one: Kyrie Irving scored 60 to break Deron Williams' mark. Kevin Durant with 19 points on a light night for him.

Brooklyn Nets 113 points still 3 minutes to go in third quarter = All-Star game vibes, silly 

#NBA #DFS https://t.co/9lxJV5WgxYThree 50+ point games in one week. 

Unreal. https://t.co/LdQ8Qk5OlRMy take of this @BrooklynNets game so far:

1) Kyrie is more rested than anyone else on the floor 
2) The Magic are hella young, don’t defend and will be drafting first in the lottery 
3) Brooklyn’s defense is quite questionable as well 🤔Unvaccinated NBA Brooklyn Nets player Kyrie Irving has scored over 50 points in less than 3 Quarters of play.

And he even got a standing ovation from the Home town Orlando crowd.

.@NYCMayor thinks Kyrie is a Viral threat if he plays in Brooklyn or MSG.

What a disgrace!Brooklyn Nets Kyrie Irving hits 50 points in the 3rd Quarter and the Orlando magic crowd start chanting his name #NetsWorld https://t.co/wbYyzmbtKUBrooklyn Nets guard Kyrie Irving authors first half to remember, scoring 41 points before break

There’s MAYBE five point guards in the history of the league that could do that. #NBA #NBA75 #BrooklynNetsNo way Kylie Irving got 40 points in the first half 😱 , @BrooklynNets them ticket sales a cover that 50k fine you just got for sure for sure  🔥🔥@BrooklynNets I want to see Blake play!@BrooklynNets Even KD was shaking his head on that shot 🏀💦 .....

Icing on the cake is if we get a Harden-like haul for him. Even better if it ends up just being a one-year rental 🤣 @BrooklynNets#KyrieIrving with 41 points in the FIRST HALF tonight in the #BrooklynNets and #OrlandoMagic game 👀👀 what do you guys think he will end with? https://t.co/suxdgrwvZj@Haydn_Barton1 @BknBronxPhilly @BrooklynNets I mean, he ain't playing till like a week later, it's probably smart to keep him on and give KD some rest.KOBE had 55 2H  In mAgical 81
