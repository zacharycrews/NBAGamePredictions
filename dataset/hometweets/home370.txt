Lets Go Raptors!!! We The North!!@TSquared200 @caseybannerman @Raptors Please consider what @TSquared200 said! He is worthy of a Dedicated Wall!Damn. I want to fly back to Toronto for a game. Hopefully soon. This was May 2016 Eastern Conference semis vs Cavs. We took 2 at home 👌🏾. Give me more moments for the Raps @nbatopshot @Raptors - your biggest fan in California. https://t.co/RWPnnoxbm7@ScotiabankArena @Raptors @WesWhitlock let's get it@ScotiabankArena @Raptors Hey @BrendaKennedy76 lets do this@BReed_Reggie @goebsy_goebel @Raptors Well if people got vaccinated then the pandemic and restrictions could have been gone by now 😊😊@ScotiabankArena @Raptors Man, what a dream it would be to see a game live some day. Living in New Brunswick, I’ll have to settle for the tv with my nephew! #goraptorsgo@Raptors Any Raptor dress like that run them the F outta town and the same with that Westbrook crap@goebsy_goebel @Raptors Good, they should do it every season until they get rid of the restrictions@BReed_Reggie @Raptors Yeah they did do that, last season@lowell_81 @Raptors @pskills43 @JusChampagnie He sold in the second round but that’s not the point I’m tryna make 😂. U said he only had one good year and I think he only had 1 bad year and that was last season. This season he’s more efficient and he’s also added that middy shot. Plus he’s playing in the flow of the offence@1saintclarence @Raptors Notre starrryoooo @Raptors g-league DJ jus shared north face on his story 😭🔥🔥🔥🔥 https://t.co/aCAtmqer0Y@JoeFJacobs @vibhorYYZ @Spanish_Raptors @BarnesFanClub @Raptors I love JV too.

Really, this “freedom” idiot has to go... what are you waiting for? https://t.co/Oyv4462Qkn@MartinoPuccio Dude I’m from Toronto - before the Raptors won in 2019, I was waiting since ‘93 for a Championship (other than Milan). So 10 years is not such a big deal. I consider MLS a minor league.@ScotiabankArena @Raptors This would be super ❤🏀 @sfnunes67@BryDollaSign @lu_sanchez22 @Pacers @nyknicks @Raptors He’s gonna go where he can win https://t.co/c00jBhQ58xHudson Bay compass, I’m highlighting, I need a Big Mac. (@McDo_PH)

Baby trex, I’m hoping it gets real fat. (@raptors)

I weep when I’m dressing , infinity and beyond , we’ll have weddings in all black.@ScotiabankArena @Raptors Let's win this @Jdkennedy54@Show__lumni To be clear, Mal was drafted to and plays for the Toronto Raptors. They asked him to play with the G-league Raptors 905 to secure a win, which he did. His ball handling, distribution, key shots, and good decision making did the GoGo's dirty in the end. Same old Mal. #AztecForLife@hatingkimani24 @Raptors @pskills43 @ScottBarnes561 Kemba can’t even get in a rotation 😭#Toronto #Raptors: You coppin', or naw fam?...

I didn’t expect that at all!@CooshTj @Raptors GTJ didn't suprise me either , but that man can has so much swag he can probably pull off anything .@brite_boy Nothing special, just a catering attendant for the sports organization in Toronto (Leafs and Raptors).
