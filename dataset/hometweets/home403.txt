Never too low.

Also, Ricky would probably start on Philly. Get more minutes. They need a point guard to initiate the offense and set up Embiid.

The Cleveland Cavaliers have been formidable this season, despite the loss of Collin Sexton.

Might it be time to explore a trade, that could provide them with a possible long-term Sexton replacement?

Nigga playing with no help  so he better be chucking all the shots atp. Also this man will hit 5 shots straight and get pulled if anyone holding anyone back it’s Ime holding the Jays back.@wear_athletic @BraydenBallin @cavs I said 2nd rounders for a veteran wing. Gordon is shooting 43% from 3 and Terrance Ross is a competent shot creator. These guys are there to round out the roster and help your main guys.@MikeLaPenta @BraydenBallin @cavs There's a better player in next years draft or on our G-League team..@MikeLaPenta @BraydenBallin You received one...its not an upgrade ..you are trading just to be trading...Perhaps I missed his HOF stats. Quit trading our players for garbage..that was the old @Cavs the Lebron Cavs. The Cavs are building a dynasty...not a one and done Lebron team...@PlanetTuck @darryl_moorer @CarellaJoe @SpinDavies @cavs 5 games is a small sample@dorosen23 @statmuse @cavs @dariusgarland22 @evanmobley U know nothing. I admittedly don’t watch many Cavs games. Barnes numbers are better ON BOTH ENDS…CASUAL@dorosen23 @statmuse @cavs @dariusgarland22 @evanmobley I actually said Barnes, you miserable Cavs fans. Bron ain’t coming back. You ain’t never getting another🤫@ali_hysong I was like that when I had my partial season passes to the @cavs in the '90s. Left at the same time, switched lanes at the same time, went to the same entrance line...@Carloins1 @stlaxstla @TPAFTheKing @NBA @evanmobley @dariusgarland22 @cavs we finished 4th seed or higher after 2013 until last yr when the team got sick and played away from home all yr long...@statmuse @cavs I'd like to see the case against him. Unless Embiid is your only center, he's making it.@Carloins1 @stlaxstla @TPAFTheKing @NBA @evanmobley @dariusgarland22 @cavs 2 years apparently means perennial?@Carloins1 @FilthyHaven @NBA @evanmobley @dariusgarland22 @cavs bookit@Carloins1 @stlaxstla @TPAFTheKing @NBA @evanmobley @dariusgarland22 @cavs your reality is actual reality@FilthyHaven @Carloins1 @NBA @evanmobley @dariusgarland22 @cavs we like 30 games in and our team and hasnt been fully healthy once.. im telling u now we coming bro@Messyfilms1 @Bballalberts31 @cavs @isaacokoro303 Neither should be traded, guys.
