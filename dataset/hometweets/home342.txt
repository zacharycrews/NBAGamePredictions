KD did his thing #NetsWorld https://t.co/ikoeEGBTyZ@BrooklynNets @Patty_Mills @sportaushof He deserves every accolade, particularly for the journey in Tokyo for Bronze. Patty you legend! 🇦🇺🇦🇺🌟🌟@saineyy_ @BrooklynNets If we being honest KD the mvp. The nets wouldn't stand a chance without him. On the other hand the warriors have a good team and win even when steph had sub par nights. Steph is more fun to watch and excites people that's why he gets so much love@NBA @KDTrey5 @BrooklynNets … and who would that be? @KDTrey5 #Durantula https://t.co/yp9k8skarnBrooklyn Nets Needs:

1) Shooting
2) Shot Creation
3) Athleticism

Specific roles:
1) Backcourt Creator
2) 3&amp;D Wing
3) Floor Spacing 5

22 games in, this is my assessment (even with Joe Harris). Kyrie Irving obviously solves just about all of this.@JelaniScatliffe @asvpbilli @BrooklynNets @KDTrey5 They shot 41 free throws...Kevin Durant scored 30 points, including the clinching jumper with 11 seconds left, and the Brooklyn Nets held off the Minnesota Timberwolves 110-105 on Friday night.

- Either Kyrie Irving returns, or he's moved

- Believe they have 2 trade exceptions

- Premier buyout destination

Some extreme upward mobility, even if they don't get the top-15 player back.@Solomon011l @BrooklynNets @yanasvetlana123 I’ll take you over LeMickey any day 💯💯We can definitely win the East with that guy but we will get demolished in the west. #nets #brooklynnets@girlsinrap @LilKim @BrooklynNets I used to go go hard for you Kim, but your career died when you went to prison .A Dios le pido para 2022 ser feliz y unas finales de conferencia entre Phoenix Suns/Golden State Warriors y Brooklyn Nets/Milwaukee Bucks

Ugly half of basketball. Cam Thomas hit a 3 with 13 seconds left to get Barclays going. James Johnson has been great IMO. Cleaned some stuff up down low. Brooklyn just 2-for-10 from 3.@BrooklynNets Harden needs to stop over dribbling, doesn’t help the offense whatsoever, offense gets way too stagnant! Cam Thomas needs more touches and most importantly Nets need to play with more pace/speed! We need more shot creators/downhill type players.
