#HeatCulture@NBA Jazz vs Miami…. Who will bring the Heat 🔥No team in the East has looked stupid scary. I mean ideally you avoid the Nets as long as possible. But if you’re Miami, you should feel confident you can be any team at full strength. Should probably not play Lowry for a bit. Load management needs to become Heat culture@budlight Game plan:

I think we can put the 2 miami rings away and maybe even the lakers one and the only ring that competes with Giannis ring is the Cleveland one@_kierk It's INCREDIBLE, and you only have to go back 7 or 8 years. Before the Big 3 Miami Heat figured out pace &amp; space, their first season together was a brutal slog compared to basically every modern team. The worst NBA offense now would be like top 10 in 2011@ChaseRodriguezz, the @MiamiHEAT play basketball tonight.In #NBA @utahjazz, @MiamiHEAT, @warriors and @sixers have moved to the forefront 📈

[via r/warriors Nov 06, 2016 #Warriors]@Thirdmanmovies @kirkgoldsberry @MiamiHEAT @warriors @chicagobulls @utahjazz Luka has a historically trash roster with horrible coaching,  he’s doing his best lol@TheRewatchables @BillSimmons @ChrisRyan77 @MichaelMann Now that we’ve done the three-heat you need to do Miami Vice again so you can tease the Miami Thrice podcastImma need a @MiamiHEAT win tomorrow plz@kirkgoldsberry @MiamiHEAT @warriors @chicagobulls @utahjazz The Mavs slumping offense somehow leaves them sitting in 3rd in the West.

The Warriors offense will only climb, even if they can’t sustain the top defensive spot.

The Heat are real contenders. So balanced  and so deep!@PrabjotSahota10 @EHowes9 Better than the Miami Heat ones, they shouldve stuck to pink and blueLebron is THIS close to being 2-6 in NBA Finals. His 2 title wins you can’t lay an asterisk next to is the Miami OKC finals &amp; the corona year Lakers beating the flukey Miami Heat. Had Golden State &amp; San Antonio not totally CHOKED, LEBRON is 2-6 in NBA FINALS. Truth. @ColinCowherdThe #MiamiMashup jersey is straight dapper! 🔥🤩

Worst Jersey goes to the @MiamiHEAT 🤮🤮🤮 https://t.co/2b3XgWo46u@MiamiHEAT The fact that Lowry is just questionable instead of some 2-3 weeks type stuff makes me so relieved@jasonrmcintyre They learned from the Miami heat and Lebrons cavs. What’s the point when you only get 1 extra home game if you get homecourt. And you only get the extra game if it goes 7. The just need to be on the opposite side of bracket from Miami.@burner_edwards1 @statmuse @KarlTowns As a honest timberwolves fan I think we should trade away Anthony Edwards to the Miami Heat for something valuable like a second round pickToday we talk about some surprises in the NBA that we’ve seen so far such as the Philadelphia 76ers, Toronto Raptors, Miami Heat and other good and bad surprises we’ve seen throughout the season  https://t.co/IYV3IYzQHkFour takeaways as Boston Celtics beat Miami Heat 95-78 in dominant defensive performance - https://t.co/YD97NbVezV
