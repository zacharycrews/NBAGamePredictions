In reality, the bucks were down 0-2 until Kyrie got hurt last year...And had to go 7 and barley win. If KD had a healthy Jrue and Khris...KD then wins..Boston Celtics star Marcus Smart is OUT tonight for Game 2 vs. the Bucks 

#nbaplayoffs https://t.co/VCSQ5t1Nzd@celtics Fuck@celtics Your tweet was quoted in an article by Sports Illustrated https://t.co/0luLi7fYen@celtics Your tweet was quoted in an article by Sports Illustrated https://t.co/0luLi7fYen@NBA @Bucks I pray for the Boston Celtics.

@Amanda_Pflugrad@celtics @ArbellaIns @PutnamToday Rally towels? Red is spinning even faster now.@celtics @Dwhite921 This game is going to prove how much of a mistake it was trading Richardson, absolutely no wing depth on this team. Hope White can at least get some offensive game going thoAfter the Nets sweep I entered our NBA show with a broom .. could you give me best birthday gift with a win tonight? @celtics 
#BleedGreen https://t.co/r9oFcBCmBx@TatumFan4Life @celtics If we want to win a championship, we need to be prepared - and able - to power through a couple important games in the playoffs without a star/essential player.@Saucy_zF @celtics @Dwhite921 I agree. Not to worry. Maybe better luck next  generation after their new LeBron 2.0(Giannis) ceiling retires05/03/22

Follow along with the NBA App --&gt; https://t.co/C2axtvsShw https://t.co/6CZVdUF4EbWhile the Boston Celtics are in a position to bounce back from a Game 1 defeat, we're not sure they'll win by a wide margin. Instead, we expect Boston to slow things down against Milwaukee instead of trying to match pace. We're backing the Under.

third: grow up and calm the fk down.
last but not least: CALM THE FK DOWN@RoseTheGod @celtics naw hes out fam🥺The Bucks are rolling! Four straight wins for the defending champs as they go into Game 2 against the Boston Celtics tonight. No Marcus Smart for the Celtics...What's your best bet?

#BleedGreen@MoooseSZN @celtics no.
Historically, no team came back from a 0-3 deficit to win the series.
We have game 2 tonight. 
Even if they fall to 0-2, teams, especially in the past few years showed, they can bounce back to win 4 straight. Sometimes it takes a bit longer to get the hang of it.@celtics y’all better ball tf out tonight..@Bucks about to snatch a 2-0 lead on @celtics without having played a game in Milwaukee. #FearTheDeer #BleedGreen #NBAPlayoffs #NBATwitter https://t.co/iCc6AeAjdj@celtics Bucks https://t.co/euAm3WQDRK@jmoran8996 @celtics TAKE A CHARGE ON 34@celtics Yeah we are done.momento momento momento

https://t.co/tITNRfN2ecTime to bounce back @celticsThe Boston Celtics received rave reviews for keeping Brooklyn Nets star Kevin Durant in check during their Eastern Conference first-round series. | @Reuters https://t.co/zhCo8veB3cWouldn’t it be something if the @celtics got @RajonRondo back next season ? https://t.co/DjnLAOSRj4Make that long Greek dork foul out please @celtics@StoolGreenie @celtics Smart Yoda 🔥🔥🔥 Im nasty wit it https://t.co/4QVLwWUj2BThe Boston Celtics just need to play smarter and harder while limiting the self-inflicted mistakes that Milwaukee will take advantage of. 
Stay calm and poised. 
#Celtics #BleedGreenTeams don’t beat the Boston Celtics they beat themselves it’s been the story of our season. We have more than enough but gotta be locked in. More importantly play our game https://t.co/G4zl02p8uZ@StoolGreenie @celtics Oh yes we do. Let's go get game 2 guys @celtics !!!!!!@Derek_Sawyer1 @nsbb2011 @celtics Boy we don’t have our second best player what are you talking about it’s not my fault if jaylen brown want to play injured you can put a healthy bench player and he has a hamstring tightness he can still shootDo the Boston Celtics have enough firepower to defeat the Milwaukee Bucks in this series? 🤔

Size M-XXL https://t.co/BFlxKHloI1Game 4 Cancun Finals LBChump admits on National TV how the Boston Celtics broke his basketball soul and that's why he left the Cavs. He also admits the only way to beating the C's was getting DWade to carry him. He also admits to Disney Bubble title as a " Hollywood production". https://t.co/3V9qJVMHa5@soxfan526 @celtics i don't agree because pritchard has only the three pointer option, while White has also passing ability and better defense thanks to his height#NBA POTD 🏀

1u: Boston Celtics 1Q -1.5 (-115) DK

Expecting a quick start to avoid trailing most of this game and a 0-2 hole headed to Milwaukee.

The C’s owned the 1Q of Game 1 until the Bucks closed on a 10-0 run.

Let’s trust Ime and this team and let’s win 12 more.@StoolGreenie @celtics Let’s hope Smart can play and split 1-1When I think of Boston area sports at the moment… @celtics @NHLBruins @RedSox @Patriots https://t.co/Si25UjXSbh@SamuelUrrego9 @Esteban96546475 @celtics En fin, twitter for android@celtics gonna need big one from you guys.

#Celtics #BleedGreen #Bruins #nhlbruins #redsox @NHLBruins @celtics@Burner06137507 @celtics We can just expect to see your fat ass under every post huh? 🤣🤣🤣 rent free.We gotta go hard tomorrow @celtics  🍀🍀Who gets married during the @celtics game!! #cmonpeople https://t.co/xqh8wapdh0@NBA @ESPNNBA @NBAonTNT @NBATV the league is fixed if the @Lakers arent in the create a new rivalry @warriors #adamsilver tell the refs to call a game equal before the elimination game with the @celtics and @Bucks @Giannis_An34 does not represent bball at all - #awfulshooter@randall_rjr @DanKelley66 @celtics That’s when he realized it was Tatum jersey and he goes “Oh man! You need a little man’s jersey!” And proceeded to talk to him about putting in hard work and being a dog on the court. 

That dude walks the talk every day.@NBCSCeltics Are @celtics going to ack the obvious? Won't happen this year. Limit RWIII. Give JT,JB,GW,DW &amp; PP more exp? @John_Karalis @BrianTRobb @Scalabrine @tvabby@randall_rjr @DanKelley66 @celtics He really does. On a MUCH less serious note… I live in Denver and my 9 year old is a big Cs fan. Smart came over to sign stuff and talk to some kids before a game this year. My son asked for a signature, and Smart told him to turn around to sign the back of the jersey….@WhoCee_ @Scamhardy1 @LLCalrissian @heineken_bottle @camlegend24 @rainierdc @BCAWORLDWIDE @NBA @sixers @Suns @dallasmav @celtics @SLAMonline @NBA_Coaches @MarcJSpears @KendrickPerkins @KingJosiah54 @davidaldridgedc @ChrisBHaynes @CariChampion @malika_andrews @jemelehill Yeah but they are minority indigenous groups like american indians &amp; first nations.Any NBA team that has &gt;50% of their field goals attempted being 3's deserve to lose...especially when there's still 14sec on the shot clock. The game is hideous and horrible to watch. Like a higher stakes NBA All Star game. 

#BostonCeltics #MilwaukeeBucks #NBA #NBAPlayoffs2022@Ye2024_ @celtics @NHLBruins Bruins@az_adnane @celtics We can’t promise@BeefStewoshi @stoolpresidente I was a few seats away from him yesterday at my Boston Celtics' game last night. This rings true, I'm afraidK so #Celtics &amp; #Bruins both have must wins Tuesday &amp; Wednesday. 

Or it’s gulp, baseball season.

#Celtics #BleedGreen #nhlbruins @NHLBruins @celtics #redsoxpleaaase get the W @celtics@DanKelley66 @CelticsSteve @celtics I cannot be more amazed by your daughters journey, and the journey of the whole family. Truly an inspiration everyone.@celtics please win tomorrow for my well beingFully convinced @KyrieIrving has done some sort of voodoo spell on Boston, Celtics &amp; Bruins lose game 1 and the Patriots took a 4th rounder in the 1st. Sheesh.@genebrew @celtics @warriors @Suns @FiveThirtyEight @memgrizz @BetMGM @sixers Unfortunately my current approach does not account for injuries, which is certainly a shortcoming. Especially when major contributors are out (or back)Still riding w/ same team @celtics I came in w/ ☘️@paulpierce34 i@hope you been in the @celtics locker room dropping any nuggets of knowledge on experience  during the playoffs…
ijs…@celtics First punch?  Bucks don’t quit.  Boston will get worked again@overtime @jackharlow @celtics @bostontamcam , So, Boston Celtics this how you let idiot fans mess with people's jobs? Can you imagine had she gotten fired because of this moron? It's not funny one bit.“They have got the best player alive, they are the best team in basketball”, Nick Wright hails Giannis Antetokounmpo ; Regards Celtics overrated after Nets clean sweep https://t.co/WYkkJ0QtfS #BostonCeltics #MilwaukeeBucksBoston celtics suck  they only beat Brooklyn  because  they chemistry  wasn't  right now they going up against  a team who got hey shit together  boston look like trash lmaoLooks like some national media members drank the @celtics cool aid a little to early. Let’s see how this series plays out.Celtics Day is tomorrow, Tuesday, May 3rd! Let’s cheer on the Boston Celtics as they head into game 2 of the NBA Eastern Conference Semi Finals against the Milwaukee Bucks! You’re invited to wear your Celtics gear or anything green tomorrow!💚🏀💚 #MillerMustangsHPS https://t.co/XSNjR5UR9l@celtics The city of Boston really needs redemption! I used to love to take the Grayhound bus to visit, but with all the crime that's happening, I'm pretty much done. I need a reason to visit again and I hope my favorite east coast team the @celtics gives it to me. Let's go Celtics! 💚@barstoolsports Someone needs to explain the @celtics this ain’t no @KDTrey5 this is mother fucking @Giannis_An34 😂😂😂Check out 1998 Topps Chrome PAUL PIERCE Rookie card #135 PSA 9 MINT Boston Celtics HOF !  https://t.co/toblFzuTjM via @eBay@celtics Please...he's playing lmaoThe Boston Celtics were unable to match the Milwaukee Buck's physicality in Game 1: "They hit us in the mouth" - Yardbarker https://t.co/SNOe0dvThH@TheGregHillShow @jwiggs85 @celtics Did they have enough fire power to beat the Nets@DanKelley66 @celtics WOW. I can't imagine what she and your family have been through! She's going to achieve so much in her life! My daughter is my world and I don't know how I would handle it. Thank you for the kind words my friend.@randall_rjr @celtics Amen!@CelticsSteve @celtics So sorry for your loss Steve. My daughter Bridget ended up in the hospital for 157 days and needed a stem cell transplant from his little sister; but she’s now cancer free (yesterday was the 5 year anniversary of her leaving the hospital for good) and a high honors student.@DanKelley66 @celtics Love that! Hope she’s doing better now@DanKelley66 @celtics I’ve heard the stories of his kindness and then even experienced it myself. A lot of people talk it but Marcus Smart lives it.@DanKelley66 @celtics Thank god she overcame those odds. I lost my mom two years ago to lung cancer. It's a terrible disease@luisace82 @BleacherReport @sedaworddd La Lakers have less chips than the Boston Celtics.  Nice try.My tweet actually made it on @NBATV yesterday! I never would've thought this would happen @celtics https://t.co/kvIci1Lz6GBoston Celtics Daily Links  5/2/22 https://t.co/e9lqdpgRUEIn 2016-17 my daughter (who does not love sports) was a cancer patient at BCH. She was lucky enough to be contacted by a kind @celtics employee to see if she had a favorite player. After some deep research, she chose Marcus Smart, and soon after received an autographed photo. 💚 https://t.co/RkvKKH9O7i https://t.co/uzAkcNX8bQLike I said this morning 

The @NHLBruins pump up video, did about as much as the @celtics one. 

They. Never. Do. Anything. 

Yet people love ‘em.

https://t.co/LHtQSo3hwa@Shayminn @celtics @Bucks Love this. I felt our #Raptors did the same thing by trying to hoist 3s against the 76ers rather than just getting the all important 2s!!@_JoseYD @FCHWPO @celtics @Celt_Ike @SmarcusAureliu1 @smarfwater @BLKRZN @manbearpiggins @CelticsLab @gReenbean_26 @beardjam @KingKrynto Looks like a foul to me!@celtics Well…this isn’t goodfor the next chapter of my career I will be going to the Boston Celtics@Julito_1937 @celtics rip, hell of a season@celtics @TheGamblorNews dear lordYALL OWE THIS MAN A VICTORY DAMMIT @celtics https://t.co/xrF7FyKA0m@WhoCee_ @Scamhardy1 @LLCalrissian @heineken_bottle @camlegend24 @rainierdc @BCAWORLDWIDE @NBA @sixers @Suns @dallasmav @celtics @SLAMonline @NBA_Coaches @MarcJSpears @KendrickPerkins @KingJosiah54 @davidaldridgedc @ChrisBHaynes @CariChampion @malika_andrews @jemelehill LOL! thats The indigenous ethnic groups.@pablosparlays @celtics @NHLBruins Lmao what do u have rn@celtics @NHLBruins After these next 3 games all y’all are gonna have left is fucking hockey lol #Giannis #bucks @celtics get ready to pack it up https://t.co/fZR0QOHi0tI like the @celtics chances tomorrow , that's all they have to do is score more points than the @Bucks and they should win  #BostonCeltics #NBA #Celtics #MilwaukeeBucks #Bucks

Honest question: how do you decide when you mask &amp; when you don’t? Does mask selection depend on who you are pandering to at a given moment? 

Why can’t parents choose when their kids wear a mask? https://t.co/l9xJjb7Pq4@trashbagjones69 @celtics Stay on that side then brother. I don’t wanna see u piping up if we end up winning✌🏽The @MiamiHEAT may be more overrated than the @celtics. I see Philly winning game 1@_JoseYD @FCHWPO @celtics @Celt_Ike @SmarcusAureliu1 @smarfwater @BLKRZN @manbearpiggins @CelticsLab @gReenbean_26 @KingKrynto What a picture@celtics y’all despicable by the way https://t.co/214SAWDsoP@PritchBurner @celtics Yup, clean up the turnovers and I think they’ll be alright. Hopefully they start calling some of those egregious offensive fouls on Giannis tooLarry Bird Boston Celtics Signe #autographed https://t.co/Ss8MvYpDQQFour of these and a bottle of water while watching 76ers @ Heats. When @celtics play tomorrow it has to be something hard. I'm stressed as heck, c'mon guys we have to beat the Bucks tomorrow!!!!!!
#goboston
#webelieve https://t.co/7e3xxFykb8Two things I think about the #NBA East Conf Semis.
1. The @Bucks are going to continue to make my @BrooklynNets look worse and worse for letting the @celtics sweep them.

2. Without @JoelEmbiid the @sixers would be better with @sdotcurry and @AndreDrummond than with @JHarden13@King69Parlay @celtics yeah it was just one game. Everyone else was going through it. We can’t have another game like that.@reed_oc @celtics They can’t do anything else Vs the Bucks. Bigger , faster , and much stronger.@RobertOpticTex @celtics @PutnamToday @ArbellaIns Haha shirt would be used as toilet paper. Needed the Larry bird 12 pointer@celtics Maybe try something besides Flop and Cry for a foul against Giannis.@PritchBurner @celtics Got plenty of open looks just gotta see some go down@Burner06137507 @celtics It was one game lmao. It was a wake up call and we will be back and better next game you watch.@HeathJohnson78 @celtics We’ll be there!!@FaithZondi I am @celtics fan.. 🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️ I am in pain as I tweet.Dearest @NBA scheduling gods: Please bring me @Celtics - @spurs to @NBAMEX , I beg you. https://t.co/RUWxaxrAZg@celtics I hope DPOY is ok 🙏🏻🙏🏻Well what do you do when you've had 30 hours of shit thoughts because the @celtics  lost game 1? What any other Boston fan would do watch game 1 of the @NHLBruins and hope they play the way you know they can DOMINATE.A "dude's rock" moment if there ever was one: fan standing on top of basketball rim at the Boston Garden, celebrating a Boston Celtics championship, wearing jorts and little else - June 11, 1984 https://t.co/McZSSst07l@yungspinach1 @NBAHistory @celtics He would have most of these dudes sitting right bee era side him on the bench@celtics Looks like a physical playoff series !@celtics Coach Ime is like a father.

Wonder  why he sat.@MayorWu @RudermanFdn @RedSox @NHLBruins @celtics The @RedSox could do a lot for my mental health if they’d start hanging some crooked numbers on the scoreboard.

@celtics fans should just take the L, stop blaming the refs, and move on.
