Milwaukee Bucks 1H -8 (-110) 1uLuke Walton-sized solution no match for Sacramento Kings-sized problem: https://t.co/xZoAcwRObsSacramento Kings should get themselves back into the play-in race quickly.

On ShotQuality, they're the # 1 team due for positive regression (Their Shot Quality Record is 10-7!).

That, and falling backwards into the Alvin Gentry upgrade should boost them into that team pocket.The Sacramento Kings have had 5 head coaches in the last 8 seasons.

The fact that Luke Walton is the second best coach in their history says it all😂....they should hire Mark Jackson at this pointI usually don't agree with Deadspin, since their articles are mainly meant to be clicked and over the top. But this one is dead on. The @SacramentoKings fired the head coach, but until the owner is gone, I fear nothing is going to change.

https://t.co/BUvdNqsLzQDawn Staley has a legitimate case for being an NBA head coach. She can instill a great culture, something that is needed to be successful at ANY level.

🚨 PLUS a link to my first-ever Thanksgiving subscription special for the next week: https://t.co/LgrKcTltKi@MarcosBreton Sacramento doesn't deserve a NBA franchise, period. Top-tier free-agents will NEVER come here. Sac is not a world-class city. In fact the opposite. And the level of civilization here, is like a 3rd-world.

Even when I've met people showing pride, it's like a HS bumpersticker. "Support them!". Have you ever gone to their games?  "Eww, no". "But, omg, doco!" What a fucking overpriced shit hole.@SacramentoKings may come to play tonight. Made some money on them early season, been fading them for a while now but they may have a going away party in Cali tn @Rizzler7 @JayMoneyIsMoney https://t.co/ehowmobB2UNBA ML. Date: 11-22

#arbitrage #bettingtwitter #bettingpicks #sportsbets #freepicks #freemoney #mlbThe Sacramento Kings fired coach Luke Walton in his 3rd season: Source https://t.co/uiSsRWBC9jI’m getting last home game vibes from this HARD 🤣 @wsxmatt #sacramentokings https://t.co/xKG3LamzxD@7DeadlyGulas @statmuse @SacramentoKings It’s a culture thing with the Kings fs. Just a poorly run organization in general. Even if they had a decent coach, I’m not sure they’d be winning a ton a of games@cameronsalerno1 Everyone in #Sacramento needs to be part of the solution. Everyone that is close to this team needs to look no further than on the @sacstate campus. A.D. @OrrMarkC hired @coachTaylorsac to turn a team around. The results are paying off. The @SacramentoKings need to look at this.The @SacramentoKings should hire me as GM. I would’ve taken Luka, surrounded him and Fox with solid, veteran leadership and young talent. DM me, @SacramentoKings. I’m the millineal Daryl Morey. It’s not too late to right this ship https://t.co/qg2YxSn6lB@RustleLeaf83 @SacBee_JoeD @SacramentoKings @SacHornetsFB Thanks for the nice words. I work with some great people.@kayte_c @SacramentoKings Kayte is my favorite WNBA player and new Kings announcer...hint hint for future tixs.Now that Luke Walton has been fired by the @SacramentoKings how long will it take him to get another job and immediately turn his new team into a regular playoff contender. Seems to be the pattern of things in Sacramento. #cityofeternalpotential@SteveLavin64 @UCLAMBB @ricohinesbball @earljwatson @NBA @SacramentoKings @Raptors Wow! That brought me back. #GoBruins@DaveLewissports @SacBee_JoeD @SacramentoKings @SacHornetsFB Great podcast Dave!  Thank you for posting.@SportsCenter @wojespn Let's just see if the Kings have a big turnaround now 🤣 firing the guy with the second best Sacramento Kings coaching record ever... Says way more about the organization than the coach. Terrible drafting and managing.I said this to myself and it's 💯acurate...McCabe looks like Jason Williams on the court. Sacramento Kings Jay-Will. 😉#ballin Beautiful passing.... https://t.co/C46KNh3e2M@FargodNBA At least you didnt puke like that @SacramentoKings fan.. Lmao@sam_amick That fan probably got so sick of watching them terrible Sacramento Kings and just puked on the court.@SacramentoKings Fox could possibly benefit from @isaiahthomas. 📱 @espn @NBATVWow now that Luke Walton is gone the Sacramento Kings have a chance again@BCAWORLDWIDE @SacramentoKings @NBA Does everything have to be about color??The Sacramento Kings are heading in the right directionLuke Walton fired, my take. #sacramentokings

#NBATwitter https://t.co/8qKUJgk3HZ@GatorSosa @SacramentoKings It happened!!! Cheers!and it's officially way too late. There's no way the Sixers would trade Ben Simmons for De'aaron Fox at this point. been saying this for weeks that there was a finite amount of time for the Sacramento Kings to hustle Philly before Fox got exposed this season. good job @mmcnair 👍Some interesting Sacramento Kings playtype stats on the eve of Gentry’s first game as coach courtesy of https://t.co/nzQffwEbRT.

1/6@Vivek please hire the right people for the job, trust them and leave to do it.

That would really suck!Thanks to @SacBee_JoeD for appearing on today's show.  We talk @SacramentoKings after the firing of Luke Walton and the rise of @SacHornetsFB.   https://t.co/lvVuMuk1KY@andreynuke @RealMurphdog916 haha no kidding. when I was at the gameci was telling ppl wow they are playing like the Sacramento kings...lmao LifeOfAKingsFan@davidbix Sacramento and the Kings still haven't recovered from thatDid Alvin Gentry stab Luke Walton in the back to get the Sacramento Kings job????? I’m just asking for a friend???NBA Rumors: Mavericks-Kings Trade Would Send Kristaps Porzingis To Sacramento, De'Aaron Fox To Dallas https://t.co/v7YjaECQXW@RealSkipBayless Stewart got manhandled once LeBron realized he felt some type of way... Watch him get moved back after he stepped up. Also, Stewart is about to be traded to Sacramento for Bagley then sent to the Guangdong Tigers, as the Kings front office continues to f*ck things up 😂Give us our Kings back! They are dumpster juice in Sacramento!@Brandonbuch5 @VicTafur @LibbySchaaf @NFL @SacramentoKings @SacramentoKings no need to flee to Seattle or Anaheim there is plenty of room in the Bay Area!NBA Rumors: Mavericks-Kings Trade Would Send Kristaps Porzingis To Sacramento, De'Aaron Fox To Dallas
https://t.co/lMoieRBbeo@thekingsherald There will probably be an increase in effort for a few weeks. But little will change in the long run. Seen this movie before. #nba #SacramentoProud #sacramentokings #basketball@QuintonLucasKC time to bring back the @SacramentoKings back to Kansas City!!!Leavin' Sacramento...

Sacramento I won't stay

CHECK THIS OUT CHECK THIS OUT

But I'll be sure to come back when the Lakers beat the Kings in May!

[BOOOOOOOOOO!]

#RuthlessAggressionLuke Walton was fired, but he still has the second-best winning percentage in Sacramento Kings history, behind Rick Adelman and just ahead of Reggie Theus.25 years later &amp; proud beyond words of these two gents.❤️🙏🏾@uclambb alumni &amp; former teammates  @ricohinesbball &amp; @earljwatson currently thriving as @nba assistants with respective teams. @sacramentokings &amp; @raptors #NextLevel #NextGeneration #Teachers #Coaches #Representing #Fam https://t.co/5o3SdJ7AHmCoach Alvin Gentry must be the luckiest Black coach in @NBA history:
☆Miami Heat (1995), 
☆Detroit Pistons (1997-2000), 
☆Los Angeles Clippers (2000-2003)
☆Phoenix Suns (2008-2013)
☆New Orleans Pelicans (2015-2020)
☆Sacramento Kings (2021) 

#NBA75 #NBATwitterI'm also glad the @SacramentoKings finally came to their senses and fired Luke Walton. They obviously weren't paying attention to what happened during Walton's tenure in L.A..@Sexton2Phila @agenteeutanasia @ATLKuroko @statmuse @SacramentoKings Search "Stephen Curry record without Klay Thompson in his career"
This is obviously not correct lmao @statmuse https://t.co/Q1WSOCO4kYThere’s an old saying in coaching.  It’s not about the X’s and O’s. It’s about the Jimmy’s and Joe’s.  Luke Walton had less of the latter in Sacramento.  @SacramentoKings #NBA75@SacramentoKings I know things are tough right now, but it would still mean a lot to me to get that follow you promised.The real winner of the Stewart LeBron incident is the Sacramento Kings. No one is talking about the fan puking on the court or Luke Walton getting fired.Sacramento Kings despide a Luke Walton https://t.co/m1hBJiWUn7Sacramento Kings despide a Luke Walton https://t.co/pna4NdO14cSacramento Kings despide a Luke Walton https://t.co/wKS3TtRyAU@SacramentoKings hire me cowards. How bad can I be? https://t.co/4EmWjEu9m9But that would be foolish, he will resurface somewhere, fooling some team into thinking he is ready to lead them to a championship. Rinse, repeat. But for now SAC you are at least free to try something different. @SacramentoKings@aspecialsonia All good I want to get that Sacramento Kings mask off your website!@bmills23 and I decided the @chicagobulls need @MB3FIVE . Coby for Bagley @SacramentoKings ?? Who says no@jasonmarkstv @SacramentoKings @kcranews big mistake😡😡😡@SactownKingsFan Based on your tweet, I have two things to say in response:

1) Win, lose, or tie… @SacramentoKings until the day that I die.
2) Win, lose, or tie… @Oakland @Athletics until the day that I die.@SacramentoKings @Rich_Holmes22 4th quarters are brutal this year for Sac.Luke Walton Out As Sacramento Kings Head Coach https://t.co/XdwFIU1PXH https://t.co/wuu6e9T2q8time for the Sacramento Kings to tell Tyrese Haliburton to do whatever he wants on offense. give him the ball and let him be creative. incredibly talented at play creation and needs to be leader on offense. can he be aggressive enough? I think so. give him the green light.@SacramentoKings I knew Luke Waltons time had ran out after seeing this from @RealTristan13 #SacramentoProud https://t.co/NwdfNQrZwRKinda shocked @BillSimmons knows who the Kings are since they don’t play in a large market 🤷🏻‍♂️. Firing Walton is the right move even if it can’t make up for past mistakes.

One of the worst defenses in the league, and underutilized some of the best players on the roster.
