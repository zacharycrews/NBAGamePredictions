On ShotQuality, they're the # 1 team due for positive regression (Their Shot Quality Record is 10-7!).

Everyone that is close to this team needs to look no further than on the @sacstate campus. A.D. @OrrMarkC hired @coachTaylorsac to turn a team around. The results are paying off. The @SacramentoKings need to look at this.The @SacramentoKings should hire me as GM. I would‚Äôve taken Luka, surrounded him and Fox with solid, veteran leadership and young talent.

#NBA75 #NBATwitterI'm also glad the @SacramentoKings finally came to their senses and fired Luke Walton. They obviously weren't paying attention to what happened during Walton's tenure in L.A..@Sexton2Phila @agenteeutanasia @ATLKuroko @statmuse @SacramentoKings Search "Stephen Curry record without Klay Thompson in his career"
This is obviously not correct lmao @statmuse https://t.co/Q1WSOCO4kYThere‚Äôs an old saying in coaching.  It‚Äôs not about the X‚Äôs and O‚Äôs. It‚Äôs about the Jimmy‚Äôs and Joe‚Äôs.  Luke Walton had less of the latter in Sacramento.  @SacramentoKings #NBA75@SacramentoKings I know things are tough right now, but it would still mean a lot to me to get that follow you promised.The real winner of the Stewart LeBron incident is the Sacramento Kings.
