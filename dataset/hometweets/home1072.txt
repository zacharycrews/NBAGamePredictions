#sportbetting@BrooklynNets @KDTrey5 @IamJJ16 @KDTrey5  My all timeThe @BrooklynNets play basketball today https://t.co/WpFpZMRC0u@CityTim30 @BrooklynNets @BrooklynBrigade Happy birthday dudeThe 37-34 Brooklyn Nets are probably headed for the Eastern Conference play-in tournament – but at least they should have both Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving for Wednesday’s road game (7:30 PM ET, ESPN) versus the 49-23 Memphis Grizzlies, who might be without Ja Morant (knee).@CityTim30 @BrooklynNets @BrooklynBrigade Happy birthday budI am going on record now, NYC will roll back vaccine mandates the day after the Brooklyn Nets get eliminated from the playoffs.Part of me feels like Kevin Durant enjoys the challenge of these Home games without Kyrie, obviously he would rather have Kyrie on the court, but bro seems ready to hoop REGARDLESS, and that's Brooklyn Nets basketballThe @utahjazz will look for their fourth straight win tonight when they face the @BrooklynNets.

And was there any restrictions on who could attend?Looking forward to joining @wpix tonight to talk @BrooklynNets and #covid #vaccination rules in NYC@BrooklynNetcast @HoopSpaces @BrooklynNets Why would you trade Joe and a young guy lol. To yield a guy playing well on the worst team in the NBA. He is good btw but you don't need to trade both of those lol@PlayboiSimmons @BrooklynNetcast @BrooklynNets I love Joe but the addition of Seth helps fill his role a bit. If we can add a player that fills a hole on our team, I don’t think it would hurt too much to trade Joe@NetsVsTheNBA @BrooklynNetcast @BrooklynNets People really underrate Joe Harris cuz they haven’t seen him in a while@NetsVsTheNBA @BrooklynNetcast @BrooklynNets i’m not willing to do that.@BrooklynNets Make those jerseys and the old NJ nets court the standard again.

The nets will finish the regular season as 8th seed/ go to the play-in win their matchup and get the 7th seed.

Fans of the Brooklyn Nets have protested outside the team's Barclays Center arena in support of star player Kyrie Irving, who remains unable to play games in New York because of the city's Covid vaccine mandate policy.Nic Claxton’s increased role to continue with LaMarcus Aldridge sidelined #Brooklyn #Nets #NBA https://t.co/qvBZXeQ0eTHow Gianni’s just come off a championship and finals mvp but agreeing with his franchise to sit games so he and the bucks can duck the Brooklyn nets in first round matchup. 

I don’t respect that at all.@Jaysweat__ @JamesTatumTGC @Krisplashed He is the key to the deal but he’s coming to Brooklyn as the 3rd best player on the team , harden was an accessory not a necessity in Brooklyn in philly ya needed ben to be more than what he really is so the trade in whole made nets a better team than philly
