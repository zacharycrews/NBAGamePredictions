#NewYorkForever #NBA #NBATwitter #NBA75@MTDeSilva91 No, that's not likely. Barcelona signed a 4 year deal with him and that contract has to be bought out by New York at some point. But Barcelona would value winning the Euroleague and Spanish championship more than the $$$ Knicks will pay them for Jokubaitis imo.Tonight's starting lineup for the New York Knicks: Walker, Fournier, Barrett, Randle, Robinson https://t.co/bVWH4AMCA2Just about 20 minutes away from tip off between the New York Knicks (8-6) and the Orlando Magic (3-11).
