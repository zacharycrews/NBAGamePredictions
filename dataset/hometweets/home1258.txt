I do think we need to include more New Orleans music at home games. Bring back the funk band. That was awesome.@Prostacker @FieldYates @SacramentoKings New Orleans already has a team💀 @PelicansNBAIsn’t it time we let the Jazz name go? Not sure about everyone else, but the Pelicans have grown on me. The music, Mardi Gras, local cuisine etc has and always will be New Orleans. The whole world knows this.

Pelicans is a growing identity and it screams New Orleans basketball.Phoenix was 5-3 in regular season games with Chris Paul, but without Devin Booker.

New Orleans is 12-7 in all games that both Brandon Ingram and CJ McCollum played in.
