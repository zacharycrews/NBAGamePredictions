https://t.co/mtSQ7WbTyk@Shainevercaps @dnimeIy @BrooklynNetcast @BrooklynNets @Patty_Mills @JHarden13 @blakegriffin23 @KDTrey5 @Boness305 Pretty sure he only dropped 40 like once the entire last season... That Harden is goneSo Bradley Beal (who is unvaxxed) can go to Brooklyn &amp; play against the Nets in a game. But Kyrie Irving can’t even practice or play with his own team. That’s the rule in New York. 
Makes sense!!! 🤦🏼‍♂️@BrooklynNets Off To A Slow Start in 2021-22

Westbrook does not fit into this team

Jerry West was here he makes this trade. 

Wes  for KYRIE IRVINE!
He only would miss 1 Game Toronto. 1 in Brooklyn and 3 in Golden State

Irvine makes $10 M less then Wes so Nets throw in Milsap.

LA now 🏆@MikeKing00 The diamond pattern on white gets lost. That's simply poor design. The solution was in place years ago. Nike being Nike. @PhilHecken @TruColorNet @BrooklynNets @uniwatch https://t.co/2F06DBoI3EFriday Night Ball in Brooklyn🏀
