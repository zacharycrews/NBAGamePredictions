#WheelsUp #BamBam @BamBam1AGrizzlies/Warriors tonight is such a toss up in my mind

Memphis’ role players are bound to step up, but it seems clear Golden State’s shooting will be better.

Confident in saying that GS has no one to guard Ja, but if Steph/Klay/Poole all play well, it doesn’t matter.Let’s go my Golden State @warriors tonight!!!!

#GaryPaytonII #NBACommunityAssistAnalyzing Saturday’s Memphis Grizzlies at Golden State Warriors Game 3 odds and lines, with NBA expert picks, predictions and best bets.  https://t.co/YBLcW5sIPJI really would love to see this happen. Need Mark back on an @NBA team coaching. The @warriors did him dirty 😑😑😑 https://t.co/4XR7ZLCECx@DogSurfRoadshow @richcassanova13 @957thegame @NBA @warriors Right some is needed though for proper reference. Rick does this great obviously. What happened to Deiter ?If the @warriors as a team plays with the same intensity and confidence exuded by @Not_Poole and not turn the ball over, the series will be over in game 5. @StephenCurry30 should play like he is the best player on the court, play with confidence, don’t let up. #MakeYourFreeThrows@warriors Let's vote for Gary Payton II 🌴🐰🐢🍑🌞🐢🐜💚
