#NBA #bet #dataanalytics #tradeEvery team I bet on today was just full of worthless cunts. Grizzlies hawks blues and those lousy motherfuckers Philadelphia 76ers…..I guess superstars take the day off on Sundays.The Philadelphia 76ers are overrated!The Orlando Magic coach Jamahl Mosley rode RJ Hampton too long against the Philadelphia 76ers. Markell Fultz would have been a better option as he’s the best floor general and playmaker on this roster and is a high level defender.Boston Celtics 92 (Jayson Tatum 21 pts, 11 rebs) Dallas Mavericks 95 (Luka Doncic 26 pts), Orlando Magic 114 (Wendell Carter 23 pts, 12 rebs) Philadelphia 76ers 116 (Joel Embiid 35 pts, 16 rebs), Magic queda sin Chances de PlayoffsI’ve never been this excited watching any sports team in my life and I don’t see that slowing down. The Philadelphia 76ers are the most exciting team in any sport right now and I’m sorry but that’s objective.Moritz Wagner with a dunk vs the Philadelphia 76ers
