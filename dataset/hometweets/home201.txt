[FD(64.6) DK(72)]Atlanta. Hawks nice win vs Bucks however before I say anything get to 9-9 you have 4 Nora home games qin all of them. Then I will say something
 Nothing nice about 5-9 and I see Hawks fans talking shit. You are idiots .I'm always amused by the different types of music in halftime/timeout entertainment you'll see from different NBA teams. 

I don't know if there's any team that would be playing Freak It other than Atlanta Hawks lolAlways liked them and kept an eye on them, but never made anything official. But I’m now claiming the Atlanta hawks as my “team” https://t.co/RdH430oHyQWhich nigga on the Atlanta Hawks bagged my wife Ayisha Diaz!!!Seattle's Detlef Schrempf records 6 rejections in close victory against Atlanta Hawks. #NBA #NBA9798Game stream: Milwaukee Bucks vs. Atlanta Hawks https://t.co/cTH9pYJqvo#Atlanta Hawks - Milwaukee Bucks ★ #3er cuarto terminado: 89 - 77 by: #SofaScore🚨 UPDATE: Clint Capela - Atlanta Hawks has a Double Double
