We would be up 2 games on Cavs if lose. 3 if we win with 5 games left. So right now Cavs have to win 3 out their 4 games since we have tie breaker to even make the playoffs?James Harden in his last 5 games vs the Chicago Bulls is averaging 14.8 PPG on 34.4% FG. He's 3-2 in those games, one of those 3 wins being a game where Harden dropped a 5 pt triple single. Factor that into Philly now, where Embiid is 11-0 against us, it should be interesting.üèÄTop 10 Plays of the Season ...so far|Chicago Bulls Mid-Season HighlightsüèÄ

Love em!@RoyalTez_ @chicagobulls DJJ really does deserve to be on the floor. It appears that Coach Donovan is dead set on a 9 man rotation.

When Lonzo comes back, another guy will be the odd man out: Likely either Javonte, Tristan, or Coby.

It looks like Javonte will be on the bench w/ DJJ with a full roster.Board of law examiners: "Court appropriate attire required to be sworn in."
