When Lonzo returns, another rotation guy will be the victim of Donovan's agenda. Could be Javonte, Coby, or Tristan. Looks like Javonte is next benched@LukapsPorzoncic @chicagobulls Yup love the artsy blendFully Fit Miami Heat Team R.I.P Chicago Bulls 🙏❤️🤍Atlanta Hawks - Brooklyn Nets

We would be up 2 games on Cavs if lose. 3 if we win with 5 games left. So right now Cavs have to win 3 out their 4 games since we have tie breaker to even make the playoffs?James Harden in his last 5 games vs the Chicago Bulls is averaging 14.8 PPG on 34.4% FG. He's 3-2 in those games, one of those 3 wins being a game where Harden dropped a 5 pt triple single. Factor that into Philly now, where Embiid is 11-0 against us, it should be interesting.🏀Top 10 Plays of the Season ...so far|Chicago Bulls Mid-Season Highlights🏀

When Lonzo comes back, another guy will be the odd man out: Likely either Javonte, Tristan, or Coby.

It looks like Javonte will be on the bench w/ DJJ with a full roster.Board of law examiners: "Court appropriate attire required to be sworn in."

https://t.co/DhiNtKz4lsRaptors-Bulls tied for 4th. Bulls tiebreaker. Raps must be 1 game better over 5 to move up.

Bulls Final 5: Heat, Buck, Celtics, Hornets, Timberwolves.

Raptors Final 5: Heat, Hawks, 76ers, Rockets, Knicks.

Raps play 3 teams with worse records than the *WORST* team Chicago gets.@chicagobulls I remember when these dropped. Everyone went nuts and all the rich boys had them@chicagobulls DeMar….😂. So pure. #LeadershipMattersReally hoping @KUHoops win the natty, @chicagobulls get it figured out for the playoffs, @Chiefs get back to the Bowl, and @AlabamaFTBL is themselves. This year has a chance to be insane for me. 🌻🐂🐺🐘@chicagobulls @DeMar_DeRozan tough guy@TonyKhan That match was like a vintage Chicago Bulls vs NY Knicks game from the 90s.
