It's a joke reuniting KD with Westbrook.So James Harden is walking away from a 3 year 150 million dollar extension to stay with the Brooklyn Nets. My math tells me that's 50 million a season. Rumor has it he wants to reunites with Daryl Morey in Philly. It could be a possible sign &amp; trade with Ben Simmons. NBA 🤑🥂(-3)Los Angeles Lakers vs Brooklyn Nets   o/u 226.5

Do you trade him now and probably lower your championship possibilties since you will get worse and not get even value, or do you go for it and risk losing him for nothing at the end of the season...If it’s one thing anyone should know it’s not to believe anything that comes from the media regarding the Brooklyn Nets…literally every player has spoke on the credibility of them..you’re a bozo you believe it at this point@staypressedd @dillywack16 @SixersTre @TheNBACentral @JakeLFischer The reports are all saying he's done with the nets. He knows what the nets have to offer. They cant offer more or less than the max. If he wanted to stay in Brooklyn he would have already extended.@BrooklynNetcast I appreciate your optimism, but it’s certainly possible he leaves Brooklyn in the summer. I’m sure he’s not happy with the current situation. (Kyrie PT) (KD Injury) 2 years in a row he’s had to shoulder the load. It’s really 60/40 rn between 76ers Nets in our favor.And still, the Nets season (&amp; future) rides on the status of Kyrie Irving. Nothing has changed since September.

The only fundamental change for Brooklyn from last season to this season is Irving's status.The Lakers posted up a ten game winning streak against the Brooklyn Nets starting on February 5th, 2008 with a, 105-90 win. Then, November 25th, 2008, 120-93, March 27, 2009, 103-95, November 29, 2009, 106-87, December 19 2009, 103-84, December 12, 2010, 99-92,For the first time since the first week of the season, LeBron James is not on the Lakers injury report at all prior to their game against the Brooklyn Nets.  @LakersSBN https://t.co/ZEBlyB8IOt@IBRZ96 @BrooklynNets It’s a huge risk I agree but Sixers left with no better option tbh unless Beal becomes available which is unlikely. You must be worried for Ben, a year without playing for a mentally fragile person could completely break him. Wonder how he plays when he’s back on the courtEP.36 dropped the second this tweet went out 👀

Nets is Houston all over again. he has to leave.This will be the 95th meeting between the Lakers and the Nets. The Los Angeles Lakers lead the series against Brooklyn, 66-28. The Nets won the last matchup back on December 25 of 2021, 122-115.James Harden has not enjoyed living in Brooklyn and has voiced his frustrations regarding Kyrie Irving's part-time playing status, per B/R's @JakeLFischer

Harden has made it clear he intends to test out free agency even if it leads him back to the Nets https://t.co/aYh6bKO6uyIf you are the Nets do you trade Kyrie Irving if it means being able to keep Harden in Brooklyn?James Harden has not enjoyed living in Brooklyn and has voiced his frustrations regarding Kyrie Irving's part-time playing status, per B/R's @JakeLFischer

Harden has made it clear he intends to test out free agency even if it leads him back to the Nets https://t.co/7bhI9QnGkOIf I’m allowed to look on the bright side, Fischer does say that “Harden remains invested in competing for the title in Brooklyn this season.” 

I think most, if not all, of Harden’s gripes would be solved with the Nets simply winning.The Brooklyn Nets are tied for second place with the Chicago Bulls in the Eastern Conference Standings at (29-17). Meanwhile the Lakers are (23-24) as they hold onto the eight spot in the West.@BrooklynNets take my debit card and sign Harden to a max extension y’all don’t even gotta pay me back frfr it’s cool https://t.co/a3Oginw8g6 https://t.co/HFJjeXQVzqJake Fischer’s article is very blatant about Harden and the Sixers’ mutual interest for each other. It just really seems like unless the Nets win the chip, Harden is coming to Philly in the off-season and Ben is going to Brooklyn in a S&amp;TThrough games on Jan. 24, here's how all members of the Brooklyn Nets have fared on both ends of the floor during the 2021-22 NBA season, per TPA. https://t.co/waCIBcSz6OBrooklyn going to blow themselves up and Bron/AD panicked for no reason because of the nets super team to trade for a 3rd “star”

Brooklyn blew a golden opportunity on the road, where it had both superstar Kyrie Irving and the NBA’s best record. Now the Nets return to Barclays Center with a short-handed roster and James Harden the only star still standing, but slumping

https://t.co/BUEb3lv0fr9 losses??? I think @Lakers or @BrooklynNets will put a 10...The playoffs is going to be very interesting https://t.co/g6kk4ssGB8@WAPWAPC @kingkj1962 @AB84 @BruceArians Yeah hes sure looked hurt during his shopping sprees in NYC and going  to  Brooklyn  Nets games....Immense talent, not a team player  at all...Period!!!If Brooklyn don’t win it all, Harden outta there. Simmons with the Nets would be a look! 💪🏾 https://t.co/6NcIUD1wLR@BleacherReport @ShamsCharania @BrooklynNets don't be stupid@BrooklynNets @31philliplim As a honest chinese harden fan, thanks and best wishes to entire Nets organization!Congratulations to ohstopbooing who moved up 4 spots to take #15 on the Brooklyn Nets team leaderboard.

https://t.co/8yzss9CSSPNBA legend Charles Barkley isn’t happy with Kyrie Irving’s return to the Brooklyn Nets following his temporary sidelining for refusing to get the COVID-19 vaccine. https://t.co/bbJY6RtPKx via @HuffPost@FrazFacts @BillSimmons Why would Brooklyn help facilitate that trade?

Philly has no cap space to sign him outright.  Also the Nets can offer Harden an extra 70M, which would be his last max contract under the CBA📣 New Podcast!

#Nets &amp;amp; Barclays is the first arena… #BrooklynNets@BrooklynNets @31philliplim and escaping will lead to serious consequences. If Harden continues to play more than 35 minutes in every single game, in fact he plays almost 40 minutes each game, I think even if the Nets are No. 1 in the regular season, they will be the same as last year. On the contrary,@BrooklynNets @31philliplim I don't mind losing. Please keep Harden healthy and give him some break in Durant's absence and Irving play part-time. If the Nets lose Harden because of inappropriate coaching, I'd be furious. Some people are neither blind nor fools, but they always choose to ignore something,@BrooklynNets Focused &amp; plays with ❤️@DomainGhost @BrooklynNets @Patty_Mills @blakegriffin23 All Blake is missing are his “Espuelas”Shocked to realize that my brilliant plan a few months ago of googling “where do @BrooklynNets players hang out” in an attempt to avoid dating apps didn’t work and I m still single.I miss the last year brooklyn nets !!@BrooklynNets @31philliplim yeahhhhh@johnadeleon @davdavies Not really. Is he really gonna sit out for another team? Doubt it. He’s not gonna be in Brooklyn tho and not because he says no but because the Nets do. It’s not realistic and is wishful thinking for Morey to trade his damaged asset for his dream target@SBondyNYDN Maybe Tibs should bench him for 8 games . More DNPs, he’s go so much better on the bench, right Bondy? You want him to be Kyrie Irving at age 32 with all that ware and tear?

They already offered him a super max extension and he turned it down You got it tho bro it’s like 20 articles about a Sixers Nets SNT out there@mulonda_k @balldontstop @BrooklynNets And the way they were officiating this game makes it even more sad cause as many calls they were callin on the nets this shoulda been a flagrant 😂😂😂@BrooklynNets Yo why tf ya ain’t grab bismack biyombo.

If Harden wants to leave Brooklyn, Nets either get something for him or lose him for nothing. Simmons would be one of the best S+T returns ever

 #Brooklyn_Nets¡Triple Points! Los Nets de Brooklyn le entran al metaverso https://t.co/qM2mZ8WduI@Hargoat13 I still feel like his best chance at winning a ring is in Brooklyn. Once he starts to play good consistently and we have at least most of our roster, the Nets should run through the league with ease.Brooklyn Nets TV Broadcast Schedule https://t.co/6oZMu47WUrAnthony Davis is now probable to make his return tomorrow against the Brooklyn Nets. Here's three implications of his comeback, and how they help the Lakers: https://t.co/PCwbLG96uo@BrooklynNets please bring this kid up and give him Bruce Brown minutes. He the real deal!! https://t.co/QqstiuVmqLI KNOW KD is sweating right now. If the Nets don’t win the championship this season, both Harden and Kyrie will be gone which would be a nightmare for KD. He came to Brooklyn to try and win without GS and that won’t happen if both Harden and Kyrie leave this summer.@NBAKrell Still not sure why Brooklyn does this deal regardless… Unless Kyrie getting vaxed at some point. That rule isn’t changing even nxt year.  And find it hard that the Nets would jus be like oh yeah take the guy we gave 4 picks and alot of really good players for…♾ KOBE MEMORIAL PACK ♾
