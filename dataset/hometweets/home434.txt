The goal is to build a championship roster with Mitchell on it.

Even w ur hypothetical, if BOS offered Tatum/Brown for Don, there'd be a reason they are offering. I'm keeping Don.TIL I'm a bigger fan of the @utahjazz than Rudy Gobert😌

This postseason is massive. Win the West or bust.@NoSpeedLimit6 @SpuhKnows @utahjazz @spidadmitchell @NBA2K My point is Mitchell isnt the clear guy leading the jazz when gobert has been argubly more impactful. Who on the hawks is close to trae John collins?.

https://t.co/lhlSw9HL0j@utahjazz @spidadmitchell @NBA2K Should be more than 90This might be the most racist thing to ever happen associated with the NBA this includes: 50s/60s (especially Boston), Robert Sarver, Donald Sterling, how everyone viewed J Lin, Utah Jazz fans, the NBA dress code rules, Grant Napear, that OKC commentator and LBJ comment section. https://t.co/qtmg0upq4vWhat Danny Ainge's past can tell us about the future of the Utah Jazz – NBA News https://t.co/lDHqVVbRXs@punk_003 His heart was in the right place, but @utahjazz needs to do something about promotional ties to companies that promote bigotry. #utpol #TakeNote@Jay_Jaywon @JoeJudgesBurner @RealSkipBayless Did you question Jordan in game 6 of the  98 finals when he passed the ball to Kerr to win his 6th title against the Utah Jazz, who also had a great team. Skip, if Jordan said he was better than Karrem you would be talking a different tune@WizardsMafia Even the most equal opp systems are designed around the best player. The Utah Jazz have 6 guys that avg 10+ but Spida still gets 20 shots. Wes &amp; Beal in pressers are begging him to be aggressive. He's choosing not to. He's not accountable for that?NBA Basketball Game Betting Picks Simulator: 9:10 PM ET - San Antonio Spurs vs. Utah Jazz - YOU CAN RUN THE GAME SIMULATION FOR FREE HERE: https://t.co/HWPMc3nud0 #nba #sportsbetting #freepicks #cappertek@utahjazz @spidadmitchell @NBA2K We need to pay a visit to the nerds at 2k.

But in fairness, we didn't steal their best player.@djaerob @utahjazz @Qualtrics Well my football season usually ends here pretty quick so…@bjosserand17 @utahjazz @Qualtrics Talk to me after football season lmao@NoSpeedLimit6 @utahjazz @spidadmitchell @NBA2K Eh I’d say they should be similar overalls tbh. If they put both Spida and Trae at 91 I’d have no issue. Either way Mitchell absolutely deserves to be in the 90’s. Best player on the team with the 3rd best record in the league, and is averaging 25 while playing solid defense@utahjazz @Qualtrics The media: oKaY bUt NoW dO iT iN tHe PlAyOfFs!!! https://t.co/EewEawGUPB@Antonio74607423 @SekhangKang @statmuse @utahjazz @spidadmitchell @rudygobert27 @mconley11 they can be 82-0 and they still wouldn’t be a real team in my book😹@utahjazz @Qualtrics Honestly surprised this didn’t happen last season@utahjazz @Qualtrics See @djaerob told ya… 🔥🔥🔥4 straight!

*assumes they are the 2 best players leading Utah to at least one ring, keep that in mind.@utahjazz @spidadmitchell @NBA2K Oh this might explain why I just knocked down 11 3’s with him a minute ago 🤔👍🏾How do you feel about Danny Ainge being named the CEO of the Utah Jazz? @clintbetts gives his thoughts AND explains what the CEO of a team even does in the clip below.

Super undersized back court problem would still be a huge concern since he like 2 inches taller then cp3@RealTalk900 Really thought we were gonna get past the Utah Jazz too😭 best thing to come of that series was B.Diddy posterizing AK-47👀@hansen_asher @statmuse @spidadmitchell @utahjazz Underrated by who exactly? He is 3x dpoy and discussed as top 10 player yet he can't do anything on offense or defense outside the paint. He is an elite specialist not an MVP

-Giannis, KD, Jokic, Curry ... I can see Mitchell in the convo for the 5th spot with DeRozan, CP3/Book
