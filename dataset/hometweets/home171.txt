He has however expressed his grief for the deaths of others such as Lauren McClusky who is white. So he has shown that race doesn’t determine who he grieves, you have just told us all it matters to you.@SteveVernois @DeseretNews @utahjazz @spidadmitchell @NBASarah "Stop hazing &amp; bullying"

#NBATwitter #NBAPicks #SportsBetting #GamblingTwitter https://t.co/3ywvCyDwS5@RSinsights @DeseretNews @utahjazz @spidadmitchell @NBASarah Weird that @spidadmitchell didn't express his shock, anger and disbelief at this child's suicide. Oh, because the child involved was white.@SteveVernois @DeseretNews @utahjazz @spidadmitchell @NBASarah Two questions

What did I say that is racist?

Which part is me "treating black Americans as if they are children"?

Go ahead.@SteveVernois @DeseretNews @utahjazz @spidadmitchell @NBASarah Weird that not that long ago you shared a story about another family that had suffered from a suicide.. I only see one thing different about that family and the one you are questioning. I think you told on yourself. https://t.co/OZxcKHHBsr@SteveVernois @DeseretNews @utahjazz @spidadmitchell @NBASarah This you? https://t.co/KeY19cNUB6Anyways - I've seen some people who seem legit upset over him potentially being a BYU donor.

But he's always had deep pockets for BYU.

I mean if he came out and said "The Utah Jazz are signing the entire BYU team to an NIL deal!" Then yeah let's talk lol

But otherwise?@SteveVernois @DeseretNews @utahjazz @spidadmitchell @NBASarah You aren't making the point you think you're making.

Put down the shovel and examine your thought process.@WilliamBabbel @drawing_defense @kirkgoldsberry @TheWarriorsTalk @warriors @utahjazz @MiamiHEAT @WashWizards @chicagobulls No he’s not wrong, wiseman was genuinely lost out there.

I wondered if we’d see him a decent amount when Conley is out in back-2-backs but, unless I’ve missed it, doesn’t seem to be happening like that.@nbatopshot @Raptors @sixers @Pacers @utahjazz @MiamiHEAT @LAClippers @TyreseMaxey obviously@DeseretNews @utahjazz @spidadmitchell @NBASarah I'm not a Jazz fan, but have tons of respect for Ingles and Mitchell.

Go Jazz! @ Utah Jazz https://t.co/oPwIgkwdtR@BensHoops @utahjazz What do you think happens with Butler this season? 

Obviously he isn’t in the main rotation—whose minutes would Quinn really sacrifice at this point. I haven’t followed closely enough, but seems like Quinn is more likely to go to Trent Forrest first? Does that persist?🏀 Clippers look for 6th straight win

https://t.co/mtA2GwxB6u@PlantBasedChad @utahjazz Me freaking too!@kirkgoldsberry @warriors @utahjazz @MiamiHEAT @WashWizards @chicagobulls My Cavs are barely in the right upper quadrant, but “barely”COUNTS.@utahjazz @ATTSportsNetRM @ZoneSportsNet @kslnewsradio @vivintarena Royce O’Neale is the key tonight imo. He puts up 15-8 and I think the Jazz cruise to this W. He’s gotta take Sabonis to school down low@kirkgoldsberry @warriors @utahjazz @MiamiHEAT @WashWizards @chicagobulls The Sixers having the #1 offense despite missing half their team is insaneBtw the Utah Jazz or a contender 

Stop being blinded by their supposed “playoff failures”Donovan Mitchell was 13 of 52 in his first five real games with the Utah Jazz, that’s 25% and he got to do that on over 20 minutes per game. Why did we expect Butler to come out like an all-star playing five minutes a game. Poor guy@kirkgoldsberry @warriors @utahjazz @MiamiHEAT @WashWizards @chicagobulls I don’t want to hear anybody talking about how the Thunder are somehow a disgrace to the league when there are teams that look significantly worse than we do right now.@Steve_Jankowski @kirkgoldsberry @warriors @utahjazz @MiamiHEAT @WashWizards @chicagobulls Warriors were #5 last year.

I wouldn't call those guys clueless. I'm not calling him a bust - too early for that, but there's no way you can pencil him in as a starter or even rotation player. Not easy to be a big in the NBA &amp; hasn't proven he can shoot.@kirkgoldsberry @warriors @utahjazz @MiamiHEAT @WashWizards @chicagobulls Tyrese Maxey and George Niang currently have the best offense in the leagueAdding the following parlay:

#TakeNoteSometimes rebounding totals can be misleading, but rebound  % is usually a good stat. The @pacers do give up too many 2nd chance points, but they are 3rd in the @NBA in rebound %.

Scottie Pippen is very dishonest, trying to down that MJ moment in that era.@801Barney @utahjazz Is there any bigger bandwagonner than Stephen A.

#DenverNuggets #Jokic #JokicBrothers #pacersgamenight #NBA #NBATwitter@Daldo315Dallas Like how do you watch Utah Jazz games and not understand how bad of fit this would be? The whole reason the Jazz’s offense is one of the best in league since getting Conley is because they have 4 guys surrounding their bigs that are great 3 point shooters at all times.@utahjazz Daddy’s always happy.Caption this? @spidadmitchell @utahjazz @JordanClarksons #Rorceoneale https://t.co/N9slZ0VgwbMiami is the Utah jazz of the East https://t.co/vKaXOPUx4VPhiladelphia 76ers - Milwaukee Bucks.

Utah is beautiful and one of the most unique states. This is coming from someone who’s unbiased and lives out of state. If you ever want any suggestions for what to do when you visit DM me anytime.@achswan Loved watching him play for the University of Utah and always wished our Utah Jazz would have signed him.The Utah Jazz have embraced Hassan Whiteside, and it’s made him a different player

Story by @NBASarah 
https://t.co/kzP6YxPFLBHow Hassan Whiteside’s fresh start with the Utah Jazz became a perfect fit https://t.co/A44PV2I3zO https://t.co/WrbtiQMChD@utahjazz Any Conley trade talk! Just no, guys.Very sad about #IsabellaFaithTichenor Another reason why I’m never visiting Utah. The @UtahGov  @utahjazz @fox13 or somebody needs to get involved.  Sounds like the Davis School District allowed bullying to go on to the point of suicide.  @BNCNews @nayyeroar @MadisonSiriusXM @CNN https://t.co/9SI9NNq3zR@chicagobulls in 6 over the @utahjazz @RemindMe_OfThis #SeeRed #WeAreBackThat Utah Jazz scheme was fire from Gattas 🤯🤯🤯@SpenSpenBurt @utahjazz Oh damn anyone who drops a Stockton ref in a song.. I’m a fan of lol@LeBongJames @utahjazz (That said, they clearly should have given him a throwback Stockton jersey!) https://t.co/uHJ4hq3o86@LeBongJames @utahjazz Haha I feel you! So that’s Jack Harlow, a rapper who I bet you’d at least recognize one of his top songs if you look him up. I figure from a marketing standpoint, giving him a jersey is worth more than the cost just for the photos of him wearing it@SpenSpenBurt @utahjazz I’m more upset a, I’m guessing, celebrity (?) who has money, while sitting on the floor gets a free jersey. And I, a lifetime Jazz fan, have to pay  $150 for one. 

Make it make sense.@JtoThaMtoThaP @utahjazz @jackharlow @spidadmitchell That's funny since our team is full of Celebs 🤔@RyanQualtrics @utahjazz Here me out… Christmas Day game… The Jazz bear brings back the motorcycle for the intros👀🎄
