Also, he's already signed his league-max second traditional 10-day contract.@utahjazz I think we all know Ingles is out for the rest of the year now..Jazz game with Uptempo 5th Grade.

Pick : Brooklyn Nets.
Basketball. NBA@utahjazz Personally, I wouldn't read a ton into this. 

Whiteside has been injured, and it seems like Dok's best minutes have come early in starts when he has energy.OUT - Rudy Gobert (Left Calf Strain)

OUT - Danuel House (Health &amp; Safety Protocols)

OUT - Joe Ingles (Left Knee Anterior Cruciate Ligament Tear)Injury report: 

*OUT - Jordan Clarkson (Right Knee Soreness)

*AVAILABLE - Hassan Whiteside (Low Back Strain)

QUESTIONABLE - Rudy Gay (Right Knee Soreness)The @utahjazz are going to start Udoka Azubuike again tonight, even with Hassan Whiteside available.Heading to the @utahjazz game with my family. Thanks  for the free train ride @RideUTA! #TakeNote@Dunzod I would love to surprise my dad with these tickets.
