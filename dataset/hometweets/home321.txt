Enjoy ure day!!@lnigox @celtics @EnesFreedom Yeah bud keep losing sleep at night over things you can’t control. I’m sure it’ll help your mental state.@LizCGil However, I have one distinct memory that still stands out:  Our last 1L final exam was on May 26, 1987.  On that date, the Boston Celtics defeated the Detroit Pistons in Game 5 of the Eastern Conference finals, when Larry Bird famously stole an in-bounds pass with seconds left.@celtics Ordering jerseys tonight@celtics win tommo plz@NBA @Grant2Will @celtics Happy birthday@lnigox @celtics @EnesFreedom No I think he is trying to tell people who actively hate the us who are citizens here to stop crying because they don’t realize how good they have it. That’s the entire point. He’s not downplaying any of the problems going on, he’s telling people to look at the bigger picture.That would be like saying “this thing ain’t over yet” when Boston Celtics are down 100 to 50 with one quarter remaining https://t.co/FmQEmRGoa3Framed photo and signed check from Boston Celtics legend Bob Cousy.
