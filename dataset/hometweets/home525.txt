The farther they go the more nationally televised exposure the stadium gets. #SAFEMOONARMYHAPPY NEW YEAR @utahjazz! https://t.co/Cee6x7UEolI think it is time for the Utah Jazz to change up the starting lineup because the data is becoming obvious.

Best lineup so far this season, minimum 30 minutes played.

Especially taking into consideration that Don is putting up nearly identical numbers while also being surrounded by more talent (other guys to take those numbers). 

But in an all star game, gimme Ja 🤣@calebbarlow1 @KentFairbourn @KendrickPerkins @utahjazz Yeah. No disrespect to Ja. It’s down to those two for me with Steph. 

I was team Ja over Zion leading up to draft time and he’s been probably even better than imagined. 

I’m still leaning Don as I think he’s the better overall player, but Ja makes senseITS GAMEDAY

#sportsbetting #betting #sportspicks #gamblingtwitter #gamblingHow were the Jazz able to sweep the road trip without Donovan Mitchell? #TakeNote #NBA #UtahJazz https://t.co/AdEI4m53LN@JamesWClawson @KendrickPerkins @utahjazz Spida over Ja?

I can see that but I’d still go with Ja, stats slightly better (-1 ppg, +2 rpg, +1.5 apg). 

Plus I’m biased, just prefer watching Ja. I imagine you’re a bit biased toward Donovan 😜*Clippers vs Toronto 8:30 pm*

#NiceTry@BuildFavors @HallieOop Gee, if the #UtahJazz only had a rookie backup PG who has produced a &gt;2:1 assist:turnover ratio in the G league while logging some RBs, steals, and even blocks--and shooting 32% from the 3, with potential for improvement

(I hear he still has those!) https://t.co/cvnlFQC3wW@KendrickPerkins @utahjazz should have two starters 🤷‍♂️ #TakeNote@TapeDelayJazz @Suns @warriors This is despite the PG injury risk that has existed with Conley and the blatantly slow defense that Ingles has shown--and the risk that is taken defensively to play Bojan and Ingles together
#UtahJazz 
@hansenjames@utahjazz @jazzteamstore @therouteapp And boy was there some bad basketball played there that year.  Pistol Pete was benched by Nissalke, and as I recall, the  Jazz finally started to turn it around with Adrian Dantley some years later.@HottingBox1 Utah Jazz watch out!@CryptoPapi10 @BALLERZ_NFT Yea that one is dope reminds me or Utah jazz.

A top 5 team in the league. On the road. This is not a win you can cover up and say 'b2b, not truly as impressive' or allude to that. I've noticed this common theme among SAS doubters.

Stupid expensive. That means they are probably season ticket holders that are making a buck off their seats. Those prices are jacked way up.

I grew up and now I brew my own LOLThere’s more benefit to be had when the @utahjazz put a game out of reach early, the biggest one being that the Jazz’s main rotational players can get some extra rest down the stretch. | By @NBASarah

Ticketmaster is the best way because it’s the format the Jazz use so if you look on a laptop or desktop (haven’t seen it this way on mobile) you can see every single seat and they send you your tickets through Ticketmaster regardless.@RyanQualtrics @spidadmitchell @BucketsONeale00 @rudygobert27 @Joeingles7 @JordanClarksons @utahjazz @youngwhiteside @snark_tank @Tjonesonthenba Hope you have a wonderful time with your family, Ryan!@BriMacBlu @utahjazz You can buy resell tickets through the ticket office??@earlgar @utahjazz Someday WE WILL!!!! https://t.co/B53Yi9qY3s@osteomath @utahjazz That’s something I should learn about… I feel waaaay behind in the times.

#UtahJazz have none of these; they are a top 3 team in the West who exited playoffs due to low perimeter D.
