• Bulls won last time by 6
• Bulls are averaging more points lately 
• Bulls are shooting the ball better
• Only reason for this spread I’m guessing is because it’s in Toronto and Caruso &amp; Ball are out, which is fair.

Bulls are in Toronto to face The Raptors.

Make no mistake, this is a tough game. That said, we all expect DeMar to really go off against his former team.

Zach has been struggling with back spasms but is listed as probable.

#NBA #NBAPick #NBAPredictions #Bullsvsraptors@heyhalima Jake says "Raptors are looking to package Dragic + 1st" and follows with "Williams is one of Toronto's targets". 

He doesn't say this is the proposed deal for Williams. There's no way anyone is stupid enough to do that deal.One thing that was concerning going into the Raptors season was half-court playmaking.

Toronto still sit 28th in the league - but Siakam and Barnes' assist numbers are taking the creative pressure off VanVleet and helping the likes of Trent Jr thrive.

comment fair trade@Raptors Gary Trent has been on 🔥🔥🔥, keep it up brother 5 more games with 30 pts, we know you will do it.@drawthenorth @gtrentjr @Raptors Great job this is awesomeThink @raptors could land Drummond from @sixers  (obviously more money from other contacts would be needed) for Dragic? They get another shooter and veteran playoff leadership and raps get the big they lack. #Raptors #WeTheNorth #bstradeThe Heat is in the middle of a losing streak at the moment, as Tuesday’s 110-106 road loss to the Toronto Raptors marked its third straight defeat. It’s just the second time this season that the Heat has dropped three consecutive games. https://t.co/B1J9331zs5It just makes sense that the Toronto Raptors add at the trade deadline – NBA News https://t.co/SxdJFqNvNX@GTJXNormSzn @ItsEric999 is that joseph i see supporting the toronto raptors?@drawthenorth @gtrentjr @Raptors Magic.@kokisuren @Arthur41827372 @Raptors @Drake So did Sabonis. 2 times all star in a row...Do @Raptors fans realize that most of our close games could of been won if we made FTs?@SmileFuk @eshawiii @IraHeatBeat @Raptors What a stretch to even reply to this Lowry situation with then. Either way it was a shit reply. 😂 stay mad.lol @Raptors you idiots could've had maxey and a 1stDear @Raptors fans quit trying to trade our players every time they have a bad game. We can have GTJ OG Scottie &amp; Pascal all on the same squad. Distribution of mins &amp; various line ups is something the coaches need to sort out. We need a big and some depth. We’ll get it@admiralchichi @joeygilbertinc Seeing the whole Toronto raptors stadium empty just to have drake and his buddies sitting right next to each other blew my mind.@JakeWilkns I raise you, Toronto Raptors...@KateBDoll @ACE_00 @the_raptor @Raptors @BlueJays booker wouldn’t be able to sleep@Tettygard @Arthur41827372 @Raptors @Drake siakam was a top 3 option and he's improved considerably ever since, it was before he was ever an all-stari know when that hotline bling 📱✨ @gtrentjr @GTJGIRLS @Raptors https://t.co/aYxdv8VLoF@Tettygard @Arthur41827372 @Raptors @Drake no cuz he doesn't play any defense lmao@drawthenorth @gtrentjr @Raptors Here here@RaptorsFred @NBACanada @Raptors It was at that moment he realized he needed to leave@kokisuren @Arthur41827372 @Raptors @Drake You think Sabonis from now wouldn't be top 3 on that raptors team?🏀 Chicago Bulls (@chicagobulls) #BullsNation

Raptors sure had an early history!!🤣@Tettygard @Arthur41827372 @Raptors @Drake reply back to me when sabonis can prove himself to be a top three option on championship winning team 🤔@Raptors_12345 @Lakers @celtics @Raptors i do like achiuwa a lot (don't know why he's avg 11.5 min a game tho ) . dragic on the other hand not happy and isn't gonna play that ain't no secret people are not gonna break the bank 4 him@Raptors_12345 @Lakers @celtics @Raptors robert is the best player in this trade 
boucher is on a expiring deal . you get the better player and if howard gets time that's an easy double double  ... idk if there's a trade where you get 2 keep achiuwa and get wiliams
