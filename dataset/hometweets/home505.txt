Since then, I've remained a Sacramento Kings fan.  For a while, they earned that fan status, with some exciting teams.@GriffithsDVM @916BAP @AlanHolder3 @SacramentoKings Positive Dave was pretty incredible. I gave him a hard time sometimes but his love for the team was unparalleled!Now, I lived in California, and I kinda liked the Warriors, but I stuck with the Pacers.

I lived in Sacramento for 10 years.  The Kings moved to Sacramento from Kansas City, and played in a giant warehouse.@916BAP @AlanHolder3 @SacramentoKings @GrantNapearshow I gave Positive Dave a shout out and Alan blocked me 🤣🤣🤣

Positive Dave was great, rest his soul, and it was awesome that @GrantNapearshow had him on his radio show for years.
