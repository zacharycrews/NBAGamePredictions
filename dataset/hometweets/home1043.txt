I see that the Pistons are on the NBA Network tonight in a REAL "Clash of the Titans" with WOEFUL Orlando. Since the Magic held Airhead Irving to JUST 60 points the other night, maybe Killian will show some offensive talent in this one!GET WESTBROOK OUT THE LEAGUE FOR GOOD! I don’t even want him on the Orlando Magic’s next year, just stay home🤦🏾‍♂️ https://t.co/5zQpAXj3aE@bud006 @DanielH01027597 Overall, the Braves are in the best position they could be w/o him. Maybe even better. I'm sure I'll love Olson but it stings right now.I hate all things LA. I'm an Orlando Magic fan and that city has plucked Shaq, Howard and now FF. Plus the history with Braves.

Nice that Orlando magic fans got to see him score 60 tho.

Orlando Magic@reesetheone1 I went to an Orlando Magic game in the mid-90s, and I was seated in front of a guy who I heard make a racist comment.  It was a close game in the 4th quarter, and he yelled…at Shaq of all people, “take it to the damn hole”…@Mone_mcloving Maybe his t-shirt and panties. Dude had her looking like a starting point guard for the Orlando Magic. https://t.co/tIo83f9w0w@OrlandoMagic @AdventHealth @hidoturkoglu15 Legend!@RealSkipBayless Simply embarrassing for the city of #orlando @OrlandoMagic@MohantyLink MarioDustice 
Orlando Magic@Maui_anne That's an easy answer, the Orlando Magic. Lol jk, the @MiamiHEAT baby!!! LolGot to see this duo in Orlando years ago. Was a fun night. Blake was dunking all night on the Magic lol https://t.co/hXDeW9ZiBN https://t.co/98iOEG0RGl@SRT8Kash That @OrlandoMagic team had 3 scorers that were All-Stars. AI had one other All-Star who was only a All-Star because of his defense.Team: #Pistons

Since February 14, 2022, the Detroit Pistons have yet to drop a game against the spread, a perfect 12-0.

Does it continue tomorrow at the Orlando Magic? #MagicTogether https://t.co/t2H83U0Rni@BillyReinhardt Thank god kyrie got the vaccine instead of putting up a meaningless 60 points against the already eliminated from the playoffs Orlando Magic.@BrandonKravitz @OrlandoMagic @AmwayCenter @969thegame @Tozzcast So weak I don’t want to be a Magic fan anymore.

https://t.co/Eq6duGz8pb@LakersReporter Orlando Magic Howard or the current Laker Dwight Howard? 🤔 
Don't hype up the Laker fans If its not the Orlando Magic version of Howard.@DylanFrew6 @juanitocinco Like I said... I don't disagree with the path the Magic are walking. I figured Orlando would have one of the worst records in the league this year. It doesn't mean I want to celebrate this fact. And I'm certainly not betting on actually winning the whole thing.@BrandonKravitz @OrlandoMagic @AmwayCenter @969thegame @Tozzcast Anything less than 100 doesn't get applause from away fans.@BubankusMoosaka @ButtahDogDog @OrlandoMagic I love the fact i upsetted him just by blocking him... I live in his head rent free hahaThat being said Wendell Carter Jr. and Chuma Okeke are both questionable for Orlando. Jalen Suggs is out. 

Magic did recently get back Markelle Fultz, who has been playing well.Jerami Grant is listed as out for tomorrow’s game against the Orlando Magic with right knee inflammation. 

Cade Cunningham(non-Covid illness) is questionable.SHEESH! 😱😱

Kyrie Irving went for 60 points last night against the Orlando Magic - with 41 of those points coming BEFORE HALFTIME! It's a shame he can't play in Nets' home games though... (Via ESPN) https://t.co/5fule5cuA1

Not towards the end.@raazumikhin @alleniverson @OrlandoMagic @DwightHoward @KyrieIrving @TheRealMoBamba @TheDougChristie Talking about his last 9 games… ranged from 2003-2004@raazumikhin @alleniverson @OrlandoMagic @DwightHoward @KyrieIrving @TheRealMoBamba @TheDougChristie I mean….8 out of 9 times he scored 30.. haha https://t.co/imK40Oi2Ob@Djay1492 @alleniverson @OrlandoMagic @DwightHoward @KyrieIrving @TheRealMoBamba True, okay. I'll give you that. But, look at Kobe's numbers against @TheDougChristie during the latter's prime.
