He commits common mistakes that in the Finals, you cannot afford to commit (e.g. foul trouble).Can’t remember being this nervous for a long time. Come on @warriors! #DubNation #StrengthinNumbers@Shot_Quality Worry for the #Warriors isn't that the #Celtics are hitting shots. We all know that'll come back down to earth. Boston produced MUCH better shots than Golden State after the 1Q. They're both 65+ AST% teams, but Boston stays attached and forces teams to shoot WORST shot quality@ChipsWtheDippp @warriors Klay wiggins pool pleeeease shoot the dam ball!

He had to have won every one of those games then, right???@TheNachoCowboy @NBA @warriors @celtics @YouTubeTV @NBA, "After reviewing our grammar, the challenge was deemed successful. You can use "an" before a word that doesn't begin with a vowel, but it has to sound like a vowel. For example, 'It's an honor to meet you.' HIStory does not qualify. The Nacho Cowboys retain their timeout."The Celtics may have an advantage in the Finals: Former Warriors coach Aaron Miles, whose insights from his years working with Golden State may keep Boston one step ahead in the game of adjustments. https://t.co/yKFyPMSKNT@Bundlesbets @celtics @warriors Going for CelticsGame 2 NBA Finals is tonight w/ the Warriors hosting Boston at Chase Center.

#IDCORNER@cwnevius @warriorsworld @warriors Celtics move without the ball well. They also drive, too. If they guard the perimeter, I see Boston driving much, much more. Dubs playing man is exhausting. It will be a close game but you can't rely on the 3. Dubs also fall prey to the 3 point line.@NBA @Celtics @Warriors But you want to get political when it comes to the problems in this country but at the same time raking in money from Communist China!

Everybody else played like dirt including Steve Kerr@celtics @warriors @985TheSportsHub Hopefully the Celtics aren't comfortable with winning game 1 and settling with a split. The GSW are a dangerous team and Boston needs to put them down, if they can. I hope JT comes to play this evening.Will have a busy day tomorrow pls win @warriors@NBA @Celtics You people BLACKBALLED @EnesFreedom out the league for speaking out against the atrocities committed by the Chinese government for money! Also one of the @Warriors owners basically said he didn’t care about the slave labor in China! Disgusting!How can Jordan Poole get back on track in tonight’s Game 2?

It's their bread and butter - Let Tatum  do his drive &amp; do his Euro travel step - there's the euro step &amp; the euro travel - refs don't call the 1-2-3 layup anymore - it's 1-2 layup-STOP3@JaysGotNext @celtics @warriors @985TheSportsHub Back when they were 7/11Is there anyway the Lightning &amp; Warriors lose today? 

No way Celtics steal both IN Golden State &amp; there's no way the Lightning go down 3-0 after returning home.. right?

Rarely do I pay this much juice, but this spread is TOO tight for me. Celtics 12-0 ATS this postseason on the road in “tight-spread situations.” Warriors win in a thriller 🤞🏼

GS dominated a lot of aspects of the game until they shit a brick the fourth Q.

I think if the Warriors want to win they have to get off to a good start. 

Looking at Warriors 1QThe Warriors going to Boston down 0-2?

@DDDGURU thinks there's NO WAY that is happening ❌

He's backing Golden State...and he'll be on the over too 👀

🏀 Warriors ML (-180)

Golden State is 4-0 after an L this postSZN, winning by an average of 14.5 points. While the Warriors could exact revenge &amp; blowout Boston at home, I’d rather be cautious of a close game &amp; side with the Dubs SU. https://t.co/ZdNVkoLmTjIf the #Celtics win game 2 @warriors today @The_Tripleking, it's because of today's magic jersey, available on @Poshmarkapp. 

@GSW @NBACelticsGuy https://t.co/hqhMreJ2MNif tatums first shot tonight is a step back three and he makes it pack it up @warriorsEvery day, over 100+ people are shot in the U.S. This should not be our reality.

In NBA Finals history, only two teams have won the first two games on the road:

1993 Bulls
1995 Rockets

Both won the championship.

That was a worst-case scenario for the Warriors, who now have three more games to worry about A Tatum Game™ in their house, which would effectively ice the series.@warriors We win and lose together.

Golden State Warriors head coach Steve Kerr gave the Boston Celtics credit for Thursday's 120-108 victory in Game 1.

Geez make up your mind, either you give up being a lousy defender or  turning the ball over, then the young, fast and hungry Celtics will have your ass in 4.@warriors When you are ahead, you lose details. Watch more CP3 game，think before you do it.Our advantage is only brain,we can't be the flustered one https://t.co/2dstmVWeoC@warriors Wonder how many takes this took 😂ALERT: New high roller bet posted!

Moving forward, please stay focused and don't underestimate your opponent anymore. 💪🐐@warriors better figure it out fastGoing back to basketball, I do think @warriors should win convincingly tomorrow. Not a close win but a dominant one, or else the Celtics will run them down when they come back to the TD Garden.@Cavs_House @warriors I understand why you're upset considering your favorite franchise could of had 4 rings, but only has 1 because of the team you think is 'goofy asf'. 😂😂@warriors Yes he is☑️ @TheNBPA Shirts delivered for playoffs @celtics v. @warriors

Leave a comment below. #BostonCeltics #GoldenStateWarriors #GSWvsBOS #Celtics #WarriorsPressure is all on Golden State and @JimBarnesLV expects them to come out and dominate the first quarter. Which makes Warriors -1.5 a solid play. Now if they can figure out the 4th, they'll be in business. 

More Game 2 props ⤵️ 

https://t.co/bhg0BfidEPEveryone has Golden State Warriors winning game 2 of the NBA Finals series vs Boston Celtics to make it 1-1. Would be a good spot for the bookies here. I'll take team #AllAbout18 #BleedGreen to win game 2 to be up 2-0. Won't be betting it though.
