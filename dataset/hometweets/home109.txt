Though Michael Jordan was and always will be the Greatest.1-1 after two meetings this season, the championship favorite Orlando Magic (1-6) square off against the plucky, up and coming Boston Celtics (2-5) to see who can get the upper hand in a true battle of the titans tomorrow. 

Will be a true test for Boston.Orlando Magic are basically Germany's team now with the Wagner brothers.
