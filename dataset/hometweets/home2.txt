@HornetsOnBally better get on this trend or their tv money is going to dry up.The Charlotte Hornets start their 2021-22 season Wednesday night against Indiana. Sister station WJZY spoke with head coach James Borrego. https://t.co/VXlmHmvmNmThe Charlotte Hornets start their 2021-22 season Wednesday night against Indiana.

#AllFly x #LetsGoCanes https://t.co/BBwmtz75CpAs of this tweet, 60% of the people polled voted "no, I cannot watch the Hornets" because their streaming service doesn't carry them.  Not sure what the @hornets can even do about it, but this is absurd. https://t.co/AXgZdHypIsThe NBA is backkkk! And that means I get to see my Charlotte @Hornets return tonight.

#AllFly https://t.co/IlHvh4IaOUAhead of the start of the 2021-22 season, here are a couple of statistical notes from last season: 

@hornets were T-5th in APG (26.8), 10th in 3FGM/GM (13.7) and 10th in FB PTS/GM (13.6). #AllFlyGame day fit! @hornets @CrownClubCLT #AllFly https://t.co/GdCueMYGiEIndiana Pacers to beat Charlotte Hornets @1.90@CSKcfc @hornets And got waived after 🥲Who else is excited for the @hornets game tonight? #AllFly

Better a game marred by fistfights than to take a 68 point loss regardless of who is on the floor.@OnMontagueSt @hornets If that was the roster than was playing tonight then maybe that would be relevant.I WILL NOT LET MY DAILY MOOD BE DICTATED BY THE RESULTS OF CHARLOTTE HORNETS GAMES THIS SEASON I WILL NOT LET MY DAILY MOOD BE DICTATED BY THE RESULTS OF CHARLOTTE HORNETS GAMES THIS SEASON I WILL NOT LET MY DAILY MOOD BE DICTATED BY THE RESULTS OF CHARLOTTE HORNETS GAMES THIS SE@HornetsPR @hornets Cancel seasonSounds like the Hornets star has plans to remain in Charlotte for the foreseeable future.  https://t.co/i6dFsM8oCr@HornetsPR @hornets Here we f'ing go@HornetsPR @hornets As long as he’s not “out”, there’s still a chance@HornetsPR @hornets Bro let him play@hornets Giveaway and promotion schedule!! https://t.co/aoyL34oexp@hornets 🗣🗣 will always retweet this. https://t.co/aX7BjBUNYpThe Charlotte Hornets have downgraded guard Terry Rozier (ankle) to Questionable for tonight's season-opener against the Indiana Pacers.UPDATE: @hornets guard Terry Rozier has been downgraded to questionable following today’s shootaround #AllFly https://t.co/a6Rf5Iot9u#NBA Indiana vs. Charlotte #FreePick from Covers Expert Spread Knowledge.

Are the Charlotte Hornets a sleeper to trade for Ben Simmons? Could LaMelo Ball and Simmons co-exist?

https://t.co/wmW5nmqB8z https://t.co/KVaGCaQKHc@freshnoah @CrownClubCLT @hornets Seems, umm, rinky-dink.  But ok.  Sad they're worried about a few thousand (?) in expenses on opening night.

He played 287 games in his career for the Hornets.@HornetsOnBally @hornets Hard to tell when you have YouTube TV or Hulu. Stop being greedy and make a deal.@holliemassie Niiiiiice! Ours was for the start of the Charlotte Hornets season@SkySportsNBA @HoopGenius if you need someone for Charlotte Hornets analysis for the Hornets - Nets game on Sunday let me know. Can zoom in remotely, covered the team for 15 years and UK based, would love the opportunity.@HornetsOnBally @hornets How can I watch in Iowa?@johnboston76 Not Shaq. He was low balled by Orlando (embarrassing for the Magic) 

Jerry West then traded Divac to Charlotte for Kobe (whom the Hornets had already drafted) specifically to clear up space to make an offer to Shaq.I am excited for the @Hornets season to start tonight. I don't have any expectations other than growth. I am thankful that it seems the Hornets finally have a star player to build around. Is it 7pm yet?@BallySportsSO really wish y’all had ruined my ability to watch my favorite teams. Opening night of the @hornets used to be my favorite day of the year. Maybe next season I can watch a gameHappy Raptors day!

Are you from the Charlotte area?@FKNTORO @hornets You already know I’m in there!!! #AllFlyThe usual suspects command the highest resale prices: @warriors ($598) &amp; @Lakers ($562), followed by 3 teams with average prices of $300+ per game: @nyknicks, @BrooklynNets &amp; @celtics. Speaking of @celtics, they are the opponent for the next @hornets home game (Oct. 25).The @hornets are second on that list of largest increases, up 122%. @Suns are first at 151%. With an average resale price of $142, Charlotte is still affordable by NBA secondary market standards (remember, these are NOT prices set by the team).Tonight is the season opener for the @hornets at @spectrumcenter vs @Pacers. Tickets are still available. @Ticket_IQ shared some interesting secondary ticket trends this week, such as ... Charlotte is one of 9 teams whose average prices have increased 50% or more since 2019-20Who wins this #NBA clash between the #CharlotteHornets &amp; #IndianaPacers?

Other than LaMelo Ball, who needs to have the biggest impact this season for the team to be successful? #BuzzCity@LaurieMBridges IT'S A TRAP! She's going to several @Hornets &amp; @Canes items when the shipment arrives, I too went a lil crazy.

And check out this video, she appears to not even like the Hornets, but since I'm the 1 buying 😁
https://t.co/CwauqjJNwySame for the Atlanta Braves and Charlotte Hornets 🙃 https://t.co/9UHGix6YSTJust so no one calls me a bandwagon. My NBA teams go as the following
1. La Clippers
2. Charlotte Hornets
3. The rest of the stupid league@WalkerMehl @hornets I loved how much he has taught me about this franchise through the time he gave to the podcast 
Love to see this@ChrisMarsicano @LexBibbs I forgot Tony played for y’all! Zo definitely had the best career of those mentioned. Never thought of him as the greatest Charlotte Hornet. (CP3 is the best Hornet ever obviously)Charlotte Hornets- Chicago became what Charlotte wanted to be. Has potential but I think another 2 years away from making real noise. 6-9 see.When are y’all sorry fuckers gonna get me one of these @Panthers @hornets ? https://t.co/flL95gnlF0@WeeklyAudible @jamensh8 Oh look the Charlotte Hornets are trying to be relevant, that's so cuteEAST:
