Brooklyn Nets Super-Team 2.0@Cgsjr_ Carl that’s where I disagree, municipal and state governance two different things. Mandate was placed regarding municipal government not state. 

DeBlasio has a lot to do with it, he imposed a city mandate as mayor of NYC. Brooklyn Nets reside in NYC.There is no Reggie Miller 75 video because the Pacers didn’t make one. The Brooklyn Nets made these but got Irving wrong. He was the one of the three with the least chance to make it, but rolling out Harden and KD videos and being caught without an Irving one would be a bad look.Them Brooklyn Nets better call uncle Drew 😂😂😂 #NBAnews Anti-vaccine protesters support Brooklyn Nets' Kyrie Irving outside Brooklyn game https://t.co/vsSDPJzTzrMiles Bridges scored 32 points and the Charlotte Hornets remained unbeaten by pulling off another strong second half performance in a 111-95 victory Sunday to spoil the home opener of the Brooklyn Nets.

#NBA75 #nba #Lakers #BrooklynNets #LeBronJames https://t.co/24cunTJSfj@Cgsjr_ You’re correct however at the same time I do think he wants to play in Brooklyn with his teammates. 

Keep in mind if the Brooklyn Nets were located in a non-mandated city like Atlanta or Miami this would not be a discussion. 

The main problem in all of this is Mayor DeBlasio@JoshhhOfficialx @BrooklynNets Lol perfect trade maneBrooklyn Nets forced to lockdown the Barclay's Center after protesters clash over Kyrie Irving https://t.co/DqIQRIGmEz https://t.co/uemKnZqpnE@MichaelSinensky @BrooklynNets @BustaRhymes @KyrieIrving 🤮🤮🤮👍

So what you went to a nets game@Hargoat13 @MaskedLBJ @Lakers Tbh that’s exactly the type of player the nets need. Look out for a trade to Brooklyn in the coming weeks.

 https://t.co/Y7hlYhcWP5@BrooklynNets Joe Harris is a problem. The Nets organization has gotten to comfortable with Harris scoring single digits. With Kyrie out, Nets need another volume scorerNY Knicks 📈
Brooklyn Nets 📉🗑🔥🚩@FLGatorTrader @GolfSkiSled There are protests.   But they aren’t covered and they are ignored/dismissed.  I live here too.   It’s an embarrassment the lack of fight.

'Let him play': Pro-Kyrie Irving protesters forced back from Brooklyn Nets arena

#ALLSTAR #KYRIEWalking into the @BrooklynNets game it was disappointing to see a large anti-vax protest chanting “We stand with Kyrie!” in front of the @barclayscenter . His ignorance is being used weaponized and it’s hard to know if he understands or cares. #GetVaccinatedSmh Brooklyn nets was a dumb move https://t.co/dMf2MA8WfeI’ve been put @JHarden13 on the Hot Seat along with Steve Nash! Defensively @BrooklynNets are a mess and they’re missing @KyrieIrving in the worst way.  Nets and Lakers need to hit that button early. https://t.co/g6snjOYZXX@RealJayWilliams @BrooklynNets Jay, just lost all respect for you.

On Harden's 4th quarter drive to the basket (4th foul) it was a blatant block. Nash did nothing, then Charlotte hit a quick 3 &amp; the route was on! Once again, Nash saved it for nothing &amp; never used it@overtime @BrooklynNets Lookin like Cam@Viviiian07 @BrooklynNets just saw this@BleacherReport But, the @BrooklynNets should never lose, they have Durant, Harden, Mills, and Aldridge😄😄😄😅😅😅😆🤣🤣@CThesouthside the Nets lost by 16 to the Hornets in Brooklyn?  Wow…The anti-vaccine movement is praising Brooklyn Nets superstar @KyrieIrving for taking a strong stance against the NBA vaccine mandate.
https://t.co/Bqplg7XonPA crowd chanted “let Kyrie play”  at an anti-vaccine protest outside of the Brooklyn Nets stadium today. Kyrie Irving can’t play basketball for the Nets in the city because he isn’t vaccinated. https://t.co/qJ8awOZtzZ@BrooklynNets we gonna be alright!!!! People react so quicklySo I switched from @warriors to @BrooklynNets bc of KD.....but I'm now a Kyrie fan.   

That's that.

 I'm bound by players not geography.Somehow, this @BrooklynNets opener felt different..🤔

#NBA star #KyrieIrving refused to get the COVID-19 vaccine which ultimately led to being side-lined by the Brooklyn Nets

The NBA mandates players be vaccinated since they come in such contact with each other while playing.
