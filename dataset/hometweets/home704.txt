Sorry for not posting recently, i have been really busy. 

#PistonsI love my city but gaadammm let’s samtart doing d good in sports…specifically basketball and football  @Lions @DetroitPistons #detroitpride #detroitvseveryone@TyR503 @richardbrooks01 @woodwardsports @CadeCunningham_ @DetroitPistons @TheUndefeated Omg, when I said Mobley scores most of his points in the paint and Cade shoots alot more 3's obviously I'm talking about their offensive game. I don't know where you got defense out of anything I said.@BradleyBundshuh @richardbrooks01 @woodwardsports @CadeCunningham_ @DetroitPistons @TheUndefeated u obviously are a child@BradleyBundshuh @richardbrooks01 @woodwardsports @CadeCunningham_ @DetroitPistons @TheUndefeated U said Mobley scores most of his points in the paint against 3rd or 4th options...if u're not meaning defense than exactly what does that mean?@BradleyBundshuh @richardbrooks01 @woodwardsports @CadeCunningham_ @DetroitPistons @TheUndefeated umm no they're not just as good as Mobley..I never said they were trash rookies either.  Mobley deserves to be at the top because his elite defense is a big reason for their success.  Mobley was better than both dudes in the college tourney also, in fact Wagner was on a 1 seed@TyR503 @richardbrooks01 @woodwardsports @CadeCunningham_ @DetroitPistons @TheUndefeated What is your debate besides repeating what I said and calling me names like a child like that is going to hurt my feeling?@TyR503 @richardbrooks01 @woodwardsports @CadeCunningham_ @DetroitPistons @TheUndefeated I never mentioned anything about defense. Mobley does score most of his points in the paint, that's a fact. While Cade shoots way more 3's@TyR503 @richardbrooks01 @woodwardsports @CadeCunningham_ @DetroitPistons @TheUndefeated Mobley deserves to be at the top because of team success but Cade and Wagner are just as good as Mobley and Barnes but they are stuck on bad teams, but that don't make them trash rookies like you think. That's why I posted the link.@BradleyBundshuh @richardbrooks01 @woodwardsports @CadeCunningham_ @DetroitPistons @TheUndefeated I never said Mobley was the number one option...we were talking about defense dumb dumb.  U said Cade faces the opponent's best defender every nite while Mobley is scoring his points in the paint against 3rd and 4th options.  U really dont know how to debate, go back into hiding@BradleyBundshuh @richardbrooks01 @woodwardsports @CadeCunningham_ @DetroitPistons @TheUndefeated lol how deep did u dig to find this obscure website? Too bad the vast majority of unbiased and far more known reputable and known rankings have Mobley number 11960 Wilt Chamberlain scores 58 points, the most ever by an NBA rookie, as Philadelphia Warriors beat Detroit Pistons, 127-117 at Bethlehem, PAPreview: Denver #Nuggets start a road trip against the Detroit #Pistons #MileHighBasketball @denverstiffs https://t.co/je7qte5oHr https://t.co/uH73m9VDJtPreview: Denver #Nuggets start a road trip against the Detroit #Pistons #MileHighBasketball https://t.co/NIrpT8SgSx https://t.co/OSFumDbdXb▶️▶️https://t.co/U1lgtQSBz4◀️◀️

Mobley isn't the number one option that's a fact. If you want to compare va rookie to Giannis, that would be Barnes, and Barnes is a 4th option as well but that doesn't mean he is trash.
