He does that a lot, quit, give up 🤣@pragain0222 Ahhh..the ocean breeze... the sun 🌞 Beautiful Phoenix...ENJOY!!🤗I’m a @nyknicks fan and the crying is over -Nets &amp; Sixers sucked them teardrops with a trade .Awww the reason I can’t follow experts is because nobody has a crystal ball. NOBODY picked the @Bucks vs @Suns last year &amp; they made ALL the experts appear dumb AND stupid. @KnicksFanTvIt's reaaally tough to decide what to do with the Phoenix guys, man. 

Like, you know I think CP3 is one of the most impactful players in the league. And the record, leadership, availability – it all speaks for itself.

- Suns

- Clippers 
- Lakers https://t.co/TCjxcqCC9p@Irunwithdogs @Suns @DeandreAyton It’s one of those little things that seperates Giannis.

As long as there’s .1 on the clock giannis is trying to win.@Irunwithdogs @Suns @DeandreAyton It’s all part of the casual espn highlight culture. Any great defensive player gets dunked on a lot.

Everything else is around the same area as the Suns or significantly worse. I'd say both squads are even for the most part.@WateDrew @OrlandoMagic @Suns I imagine they play, but can see them playing less than 30.
Monty often sits all the starters in the 4th if we're ahead as well.@SunsFansUK @OrlandoMagic @Suns Suns should rest Cp3 and booker and they should win with our bench playersI am now 4-2 all time against the @Chiefs. Either 1-1 or 0-2 against @AaronRodgers12 and the @packers.

Purchase while the sale lasts, btw.@ShaneDaleAZ @Suns @ArizonaMBB Suns, if for no other reason than the one-and-done nature of the NCAA tournament, with upwards of 50 teams capaable of wining a single game.

That is a 7-game series and a pickem@SmilinChica @PhoenixMercury @tinacharles31 @DianaTaurasi @CP3 @Suns Same, girl, same! I am so excited and expectant for this new Merc season! 🔥@SpencerKeele @TheAthletic Spoken like someone who doesn’t know much about former Rookie of the Year and one of the greatest players in the history of the Phoenix Suns, Alvan Adams.@1014Want @Slaughter369 @NBAonTNT @Suns Can always tell the people who are too afraid to show their face on the internet to back up their opinion lol@RexChapman @adam_ballinger Phoenix Suns
Round mound of rebound..Sir Charles@TXBossBabe41 @PhoenixMercury @tinacharles31 @DianaTaurasi @CP3 @Suns Totally excited for their opening game 💙🔥🙅‍♀️@PHXazfan @NbaGenius548 @Suns @DeandreAyton I always do but y’all aren’t lettin’ me go. I thought we were just sharing pics of our favorite legendary blocks@PhoenixMercury @SmilinChica @tinacharles31 @DianaTaurasi @CP3 @Suns All that greatness in one pic! Love it!@Suns @thejalen_smith Love this guy💪💪💪🏀@Jumpshot8 @Suns I thought Cam Payne retired his dancing shoes in OKC. NOPE!!!@AZSportsRealtor @DanHafemann @PGATOUR @Suns @DevinBook @CP3 @WMPhoenixOpen I agree on that all, definitely not saying otherwise… Bucks got a ton of breaks but that’s how it plays out a lot of the time! Suns are a fun team and happy to see them doing well@stevejones20 But it felt like Phoenix really gameplaned for this game and wanted the game so much that it sorta surprised the bucks. I have watched the suns and I have never seen them utilizing ayton on switches this much consistently.@PGATOUR @Suns @DevinBook @CP3 @WMPhoenixOpen Hahaha my Guys 😃😁👑🔥🏀🏀 two GOATS 🐐 🐐 in one Pic...EPIC https://t.co/AnhtplSWpG@RexChapman @adam_ballinger 1) Phoenix Suns
2) KJ is my idol but Barkley seems like a funny dude to have a couple of beers with https://t.co/3UZ01Ra2ng@luminescentxlit @1014Want @Slaughter369 @NBAonTNT @Suns But for the sake of argument, the Suns losing to GS at home is nowhere near as bad a loss as GS losing to the Knicks or Pacers at home. Pacers had zero starters in that game. Suns worst loss is against SAC, the 4th game of the season@THolden_97 @PGATOUR @Suns @DevinBook @CP3 @WMPhoenixOpen I’m there tomorrow mate!@SUNSfanTV @Suns @Bucks @Sajedene If they lose, you'd better not going to playoff :)))))In 2019 the phoenix Suns ended the season 19-63 they went to the finals last year and they might win it all this year be patient #pistons fans it’s light at the end of the tunnel.D-Book Rocks Stafford Jersey: Phoenix Suns star pays homage to his home state of Michigan ahead of Sunday's big game 📸 (@PGATOUR)

https://t.co/ZFKD67XUCf@DanHafemann @PGATOUR @Suns @DevinBook @CP3 @WMPhoenixOpen The Bucks won't win another one anytime soon. The Suns are the future of the NBA.@okash89347298 @nbaoficialtrash @Datfool_Krazy @MideRandom @warriors @Suns Even your own peeps are talking shit about the warriors and your worried about the suns because your scared..
Choke? Haha ya'll have the biggest choke of all time. Get outta here with this nonsense.@luminescentxlit @1014Want @Slaughter369 @NBAonTNT @Suns The conversation started referencing how Golden State would win a championship. You used a regular season season score as evidence of that? (No other reason to post that). The point is GS fans are so entitled they think they’re just gonna show up and roll Phoenix. Not the case.@KungFu_Kenny30 @NworaBurnerAcc @dirtyyankee83 @Suns @DeandreAyton Congrats on losing in the playoffs@ShaneDaleAZ @Suns @ArizonaMBB Suns@ZonaHomegrown @_rafaelzazueta @Suns sorry i dont speak poverty https://t.co/F2ElyjChM4@upsahlmusic @Suns You’re actually perfect@cavs and @Suns in @NBA finals. What it should have been in Miracle if Richfield year. https://t.co/9oVgPMuYEZ@1014Want @luminescentxlit @OfYazzy @Slaughter369 @NBAonTNT @Suns You guys twist the definition of completely healthy though. Like Ayton has missed 21 games this year. He’s not at his peak just because he played. Same with Booker. Same with Klay Thompson. Just because a guy is active doesn’t mean the team is in full rhythm right away.@ShaneDaleAZ @Suns @ArizonaMBB Arizona all day 🐻⬇️ I will die on this hill@Bickley_Marotta Apparently, it’s DBook. I have no idea why. League not respecting this young man. I love the guy like the rest of the @Suns fans. The rest of the league though for some reason disrespect him.@ShaneDaleAZ @Suns @ArizonaMBB Must one choose? Both@PGATOUR @Suns @DevinBook @CP3 @WMPhoenixOpen When did dbook start dressing like snoop dogg@ShaneDaleAZ @Suns @ArizonaMBB suns are far more likely because they have more room for error; one off game and the cats are out of the tourney. but i do think this cats team is special and has potential to win it all. but we have potential every year.... just need some luck@ShaneDaleAZ @Suns @ArizonaMBB Suns. NCAA tourney is a crapshoot no matter how good a team is.@1chilladynaz @FootprintCNTR @Suns The guy behind you though😂🤣😂 he did not agree with a call apparently@mpuetz44 @AZSportsRealtor @DanHafemann @PGATOUR @Suns @DevinBook @CP3 @WMPhoenixOpen What do you mean by we?!@Hopptimist @MikePradaNBA @klaytinning I can’t even do this with you. We saw the exact opposite in the playoffs last year. Phoenix might be slightly worse than Denver on offense and they are significantly better on defense. It’s Denver that didn’t keep up when the Suns string together stops. Anyways I muted you.The average phoenix suns fan https://t.co/PwHkh3WQXJ@meatstillgrowin @Jamez1801 @ygbuckets @Krnconnection @Suns Y’all not winning it. Y’all had the best record last season and blew it. Give it up.The NBA will know the @Suns fury. They’re playing with vengeance and no mercy.@cards_suns @Suns @DeandreAyton They run small fyi. Got a medium and it’s too small.@1014Want @luminescentxlit @Slaughter369 @NBAonTNT @Suns Congrats on your regular season title?? Even though there’s still one more game left Jesus golden state fans are morons@PositiveBucks Who from @Suns co-signing this 😂@NbaGenius548 @PHXazfan @Suns @DeandreAyton Giannis plays against anyone. Y’all should know that by nowGreat meeting some of the @Suns crew today at the @WMPhoenixOpen! #azfamily #ValleyProud https://t.co/B3ahXAIpEH@upsahlmusic @Suns so so proud of uu !!! ilysm
