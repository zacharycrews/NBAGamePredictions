➡️ https://t.co/oz9UCQxdQa https://t.co/SXgf8onkIXThe Heat had a tough 1-point loss in Milwaukee last night and travel to Brooklyn just 24hrs later. I got the Nets at +3 in Durant’s return and like them to win outright as well. Miami has been the far better team, but it’s lining up for Brooklyn to find form and get a big winALERT: New high roller bet posted!

I like the Nets -1, KD is back and Miami lost last night at Milwaukee. Back to back road games are tough.

Not too crazy about any other game but do like Hawks ML over the Bulls and Mavs -2.5 over Warriors. GS too many injuries.

He’s still good, but he wasn’t leading the Nets and he was never the core of their offense. He was the third option on Brooklyn and they’ll be fine without him once ayers return.@CjKash20 @BrooklynNets You see what I mean that's why I said to stop flexing beating us when KD and kyrie didn't play@FirstTake What type of offense can the Brooklyn Nets run with KD and Ben Simmons?

After the focus leaves the star who will be back, it will turn to another star's back.
