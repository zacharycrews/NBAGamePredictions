If the 76ers could steal one of them fine, but if not Embiid should be back for Philly game 3 and 4.  The pressure is still on MiamiHeat to win their home games.

i do not however like baseball very much 🥴For @ForbesSports, my article on how the 76ers did this season with Joel Embiid out of the lineup. Embiid isn’t playing in tonight’s Game 1 of the conference semifinals against the Miami Heat. The 76ers went 6-8 when Embiid missed games this season - https://t.co/BQPL0pZyicNBA Betting Tips🏀

Miami Heat - Philadelphia 76ers

1Q U53.5 points @ 1.85 ($100)
Tobias Harris O8.5 Rebounds @ 2.10 ($100)
James Harden O9.5 Assists @ 1.75 ($100)

Some bets I like for the Heat/76ers match tonight.

I have 2 tickets to the race, al three days access. DM for more infoComing away with a split in next two games down in Miami is critical for the #Sixers. Even with Embiid's potential return in Game 3, I don't think the Sixers can survive falling down 2-0 to the Heat. With Kyle Lowry out tonight, Game 1 seems like best chance to steal a win. #NBABusiness like approach tonight boyz! @MiamiHEATPhiladelphia 76ers vs Miami Heat

Furthermore, nobody thinks the Sixers are gonna win the series without Embiid but if they win a game in Miami and Joel comes back game 3, that could swing things. And Joel would greatly impact the series so it’s not an excuse@F1 @LandoNorris @JimmyButler @McLarenF1 @MiamiHEAT 📁 2019 season

1. Miami Heat vs Philadelphia 76ers

Miami to win

2. London vs Windsor 

London to win@LegsESPN @JHarden13 @sixers @TyreseMaxey @MiamiHEAT He AND Maxey have to be great to earn a split.  With a healthy Embiid Sixers are substantial underdogs.  Without him, they don't advance.@rhi_lois @butter_valorant @Sentinels @ShahZaMk Thats bad for a team, not just valorant but all sports. If you can only win when you star player is at the top of the leaderboard you're going to struggle against teams like V1 and the Guard. Example Miami Heat in 2011 and 2014 finals.What does Victor Oladipo have planned for this offseason? #miamiheat https://t.co/IudZnS69af@HardenRBW @WanderToHOF @MiamiHEAT he already said he’s playing@SlimSleepr @HoopsTalk13 I’m sure I’ll get blasted, but what KD does in a series sometimes doesn’t matter? Finals vs Miami, the Heat stopped Harden and let KD do his thing. When he was GS they left him wide open to focus on Steph. Still an amazing player, but when they focused on him he got swept. Yikes.@sixersrock19 @cloudstryka @MiamiHEAT @FTX_Official @sixers i'm a sixers fan but i have to admit Herro brings some pretty good stuff to the teamHeat in 5. #HEATCulture @JHF_Jackson @HomesForOurTrps @MiamiHEAT https://t.co/yrJdwVkuNu https://t.co/aYeGYTa1FbMiami-Dade County is drawing awareness to the dangers of rising temperatures by declaring an annual “heat season” that will run from May 1 through Oct. 31 each year https://t.co/i7VknfEzkY@gatorsfins @MiamiHEAT @FlaPanthers Panthers?

Literally as simple as that.@killakell14 @5ReasonsSports Bro im a Heat fan. I want them to win. I think Miamis better then Philly. But theyre not Atlanta. We cant just sit guys the philly series. Am i allowed to say that?@305Culture I’m sure we have a few Miami Heat fans out there. 😉@ESBU_J @el_dingle @TheNBACentral @realOCsports @MiamiHEAT Got him@MiamiHEAT When Pepas plays in the 4th Q, with a lead...Miami is undefeated@el_dingle @HeatMakeMeHappy @TheNBACentral @realOCsports @MiamiHEAT Mitch also passed to Gobert TWICE a game. Terrible. You want to blame the coaching? Sure I do too, Quinn’s scheme doesn’t seem Mitch using the P&amp;R much with Gobert, however if you’re tryna say that Mitch is that guy, then why did he never take over and include Gobert regardless@ballaslife33 You’re just mad because there isn’t a Miami Heat uniform in there 🤔🤣My #MiamiHeat fans, dont be angry lol I did post “White hot” picture. On my instagram lol bec It may be too much for some people on twitter 😬Report: Victor Oladipo won't be with Miami Heat next season

Believe me when I tell you that I hope you’re right. I’ll say again for the hundredth time, Tyler is my favorite player right now. I do not want him to be traded.Projection for tonight's game in Miami.. 

Sixers 107
Heat 103

They're stealing one in Miami. Game 1 is the easiest game to do that, imo@ScriptsByJames And you’re a writer out here so I know your rent is higher than mine. I feel for you my guy!

Love you guys!! ❤️❤️Let’s Go Miami Heat 🔥👊🏾@TheHuckShow13 @Medevah @NBAonTNT @SHAQ @TurnerSportsEJ @AdamLefkoe @KOT4Q @MiamiHEAT Everyone worried about last year like Miami didn’t beat the @Bucks in 5 games the year before.  Worry about this year and how deep the @MiamiHEAT are.@NBAonTNT @sixers @MiamiHEAT @dallasmavs @Suns @YahooSports Lol they had Tobias Harris before@HeatMakeMeHappy @ESBU_J @TheNBACentral @realOCsports @MiamiHEAT Mitchell’s game fits much better with bam than gobert. I also don’t think any Utah player gets along with each other. It’s an unfair comparison tbh. Tyler might be that. Mitchell IS that.@NBAonTNT @sixers @MiamiHEAT @dallasmavs @Suns @YahooSports Mavs stealing game 1@MiamiSports87 @man_eagles @sixers @NBAonTNT @975TheFanatic @MiamiHEAT @betPARX @Ticketmaster thats what im worried about, the size in the lineup is better without lowry.

Check out @cozyoverIoad latest article as he gives a preview for this series!

https://t.co/WVgeBzSNTv@el_dingle @ESBU_J @TheNBACentral @realOCsports @MiamiHEAT Man don’t know how that’s a upgrade when Mitchell can’t get out the 1st round and no we ain’t trading Herro dude will be right where Mitchell is on level next season@HeatMakeMeHappy @ESBU_J @TheNBACentral @realOCsports @MiamiHEAT Maybe, but I feel like Utah is a franchise that would value Tyler and Duncan more than others do. Also if Mitchell wants out that price drops. I hate that y’all are making me talk about this shit 😂 Tyler’s literally my favorite player on this heat teamThe @Suns and @MiamiHEAT Will Take The Game Ones 1-0 #NBAPlayoffs https://t.co/LXHqukFjMY@NBA The @MiamiHEAT Will take Game 1 #NBAPlayoffsI can 100% see the 76ers covering somehow, no doubt about that..

however, Donovan Mitchell has a better chance of playing for the Orlando Magic next season then the 76ers have beating the Heat in Miami tonight.@ESBU_J @el_dingle @TheNBACentral @realOCsports @MiamiHEAT Knowing the jazz they will probably ask for more then that@ESBU_J @HeatMakeMeHappy @TheNBACentral @realOCsports @MiamiHEAT You would say with a straight face that in a hypothetical world where Miami loses to philly (*knocks on wood*) that you wouldn’t do herro, Robinson, a first for Mitchell? That’s wild man@iamtzamac @MiamiHEAT @FTX_Official Herro@chris_mcmahon20 @alex7ruiz @MiamiHEAT @sixers I agree Chris. You guys have to find a way to get it done without Embiid, who's likely to be the League MVP this year.@HeatMakeMeHappy @ESBU_J @TheNBACentral @realOCsports @MiamiHEAT Correct, because we’re winning the championship this year 🤝Miami Heat vs Philadelphia 76ers Live Streaming: When and Where to Watch NBA 2022 Eastern Conference Semifinals Live Coverage on Live TV Online #MiamiHeat #MiamiHeatvsPhiladelphia76ers #MiamiHeatvsPhiladelphia76ersLiveStreaming #MiamiHeatvsPhiladelphi...
https://t.co/bDjPXHxxRb@el_dingle @HeatMakeMeHappy @TheNBACentral @realOCsports @MiamiHEAT Although it is arguable because what are we trading away for Mitchell lmao if we got him as a free agent sure it’s an upgrade because we don’t lose anything. They are most likely gonna ask for Duncan and Herro as well as a pick or Yurt/Keef sooooo no@HeatMakeMeHappy @ESBU_J @TheNBACentral @realOCsports @MiamiHEAT I’m not allowed to talk about my teams future? That’s what I’m doing. That future is ideally a championship with herro or Donovan Mitchell in a heat uni🤷‍♂️@el_dingle @ESBU_J @TheNBACentral @realOCsports @MiamiHEAT That’s the only way we can get mitchell but that ain’t gonna happen@momofgirlgang @MiamiHEAT Omggggg so JELS!! HBD gorgeous ❤️@el_dingle @ESBU_J @TheNBACentral @realOCsports @MiamiHEAT Folks talking more about trades instead of focusing on tonight they to worried about the offseason@HeatMakeMeHappy @ESBU_J @TheNBACentral @realOCsports @MiamiHEAT I don’t ‘want’ to trade herro for Mitchell.... at all@kendrel98 Spurs matched up better against OKC than OKC did against Miami.
Thunder lacked experience &amp; only led the Heat for 50/240 minutes = 20% of the time, that’s not all OKC being screwed, they played like a young team which they were, they reached Finals because the Spurs got screwed.It needs to be all about Tyrese Maxey in Game 1, not James Harden - Tim Legler | SportsCenter #Miami #Heat #NBA Video: https://t.co/pjJHGal2r8@el_dingle @ESBU_J @TheNBACentral @realOCsports @MiamiHEAT How tf is it a upgrade lol we already went further then the jazz@HeatMakeMeHappy @ESBU_J @TheNBACentral @realOCsports @MiamiHEAT Acting like I’m not fully aware of where the heat are at FOH bro. I just want them to win. ALL I WANT IS FOR THEM TO WIN@ESBU_J @HeatMakeMeHappy @TheNBACentral @realOCsports @MiamiHEAT I’ll state for the fifth time. I’m discussing hypothetical paths forward for the heat. If we lose this year, getting Mitchell is a clear upgrade. That’s literally inarguable. I am not “focused” on trades. “An elite talent” u can stop the sentence right there.Y wouldn’t u want tht@cristiangdi @stephenasmith @Suns Miami beat the bucks if they play them.. book it,  Bam and tucker we putting on Giannis and the rest better make big shots, and butler and victor will be playing defense on the others.. don't sleep on the Heat.@ESBU_J @el_dingle @TheNBACentral @realOCsports @MiamiHEAT And folks over here calling me stupid for not wanting to trade Herro for Mitchell like smhLet’s go @MiamiHEAT 🏀 tonight!!

I’m just discussing hypotheticals man.@CEngineer80 @DKSportsbook @warriors @celtics @MiamiHEAT @Suns @dallasmavs @memgrizz Can't stop, won't stop!@el_dingle @nuthinbutheat @TheNBACentral @realOCsports @MiamiHEAT We ain’t trading Herro just stop it🏀 Who do you got in the #NBAPlayoffs? @Sixers or @MiamiHeat? https://t.co/48ZPH6pOB2 @NBCSPhillyCool. @MiamiHEAT bring Donovan to south beach https://t.co/JyZE6lmUqq@PompeyOnSixers Harden playing w/o could be a blessing for two games. Expect a split in Miami. I expect 90+ combo pts from Harden-Maxey-Harris. 7 games if Joel plays 5 games. Heat in 6 if he doesn’t play at all. Miami Heat are overrated!@nuthinbutheat @HeatMakeMeHappy @TheNBACentral @realOCsports @MiamiHEAT Which player on the knicks is a better asset than Tyler? Barrett?

Think Harden will struggle alot against this Miami defense that is especially good at shutting down players like Harden. If anything I think Harden will be more of a playmaker, so staking a bit on O 12.5 ast @ 4.3 aswell@sixersjumper The Heat better win both in Miami because we’re winning 3 out of 5 with JoJo.GAME 1

Them Heat Boys need to control this series while at home..leavin Miami with anything but a 2-0 series lead will b a tough pill to swallow...this Miami Heat team can beat anyone anywhere but an Embiid return on the road will b a lot to fight thru"I think the biggest key is what we bring defensively every game" 😤

This series had a chance to be something special. 

Two solid teams with size, veterans and electric young scorers. 

But if Embiid can't play, that all goes out the window. Shocked the line here is only 7.5.

https://t.co/OkBWEp8xQj@NBA Let's go @dallasmavs and @MiamiHEAT !@GregFPS @KingmanYT_ @timhansenYT Oh wow smh Yeah refs sometimes can screw a game up in alot of ways. Yeah man best defense is a really great thing to have! Who's your fav Celtic of all-time? My fav Heat player is Wade. Since becoming a Miami Hurricane football fan in 02 I then became big Heat fan in 03 and WadeAll 19 ESPN reporters picked the Miami Heat to beat the Philadelphia 76ers 🤔

Only 1 voter thinks the series goes 7 https://t.co/CgxXk9eXz3I’ll go into more detail on this in my series preview (coming soon), but I think PJ Tucker is the X-factor of MIA/PHI.

The Heat will probably counter the Sixers’ switch-hunting by playing Tucker on smalls. If he can hold his own &amp; contain Harden/Maxey, it’ll be 2-0 Miami quick.@MiamiHEAT Who tf do we got JesusOfficially less than 24 hours until I'm annoying every single Miami Heat fan on Twitter

Gonna be wildParlay of the year tomorrow!!!! I feel really confident about this one🔒🚨 hop on the wagon ppl and win your money 💰

The same offensive scheme when Celtics lost to Miami Heat in 2020. Same 3pt jacking offensive scheme.

Doesn’t matter though, because I actually think the Sixers will win in 7.Miami heat play basketball tomorrow.. FINALLY ! 🤩@pastaman927 @MiamiHEAT Game 2 is Wednesday. If he’s getting ruled out for a game over 24 hours away, he’ll likely miss at least game 2. We need to get to the “game time decision” phase, which feels far away at this point.#SportsBetting bet of the day for tomorrow is:
