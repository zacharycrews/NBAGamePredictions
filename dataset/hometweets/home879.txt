They are claiming that he never suffered mental health issues. #bensimmonsbacklash #bad315 JenileeB https://t.co/qCfCuBaiiMHarden made this tweet just a month ago when everything seemed to be fine in Brooklyn 

I wonder what really happened between him and Nets/KD/Kyrie during that time

There’s definitely some things done behind the scenes that we don’t know yet https://t.co/cYtgdhMCBn@PodThorn @BrooklynNetcast I think cutting Bembry is a sign Brown may actually get a new deal with the Nets. The fact he was so bad earlier this year probably kept him in Brooklyn’s role-player price bracket.

Clearly no one was happier to see Harden gone (besides Nash).

Obviously the FTs were an issue but that was obviously mental. I went to every game of the Atlanta series-@ShenkKyle @pst39414306 @AASpark27 @BrooklynNets And to think he was the reason we had to let a winner like Jimmy Butler walk. How sad.

@LongIslandNets x @BrooklynNets https://t.co/OwpppsZrNfHere we go with CSI Instant Replay on the NBA. Ruins sports. Only obvious blown calls should be reviewed. The rest of this stuff takes away from the spirit of the game.

#BrooklynNets #KnicksThe BROOKLYN Nets have defeated the New York Knicks 111-106

A gritty performance by a Nets squad who trailed by 28 in the first half… 18 in the 4th quarter… BUT NEVER QUIT

🎥  @espn 

 https://t.co/enehs1q6GALove seeing the @BrooklynNets team vibe right now! What a great comeback!  Team is gelling in a big way and it’s so good to see.@BrooklynNets @24_camthomas LFG CAM@nyknicks blew a 28 point lead?!?!? @BrooklynNets great win tonight!!!! https://t.co/P6K4XeukvI@BrooklynNets Nets 2-0 without Harden 👀👀Ben Simmons sits on the @BrooklynNets bench for the first time, and they erase a 28-point deficit on the road against the Knicks. 

These Nets are fun. And maybe now they have an unlikely hood-luck charm… #nba #nets #BenSimmonsThe Nets defeat the Knicks 111-106. This is a new Brooklyn team with life!! Down 28 points, no problem. What an awesome performance tonight from the NetsThe Brooklyn Nets erased a 28 point deficit with these guys out. Truly amazing

Cam Thomas is here, what a stud

Shoutout to the Centers LMA/Drum for their contributions

The vibe is totally different. Maybe Harden was a big problem 

Lets make it 3 in a row tomorrow

#NetsWorld https://t.co/5Ybx70vQPE@NBA @BrooklynNets Cam Thomas is what @ScooterMagruder would call a "grown man."Now I gotta watch replay to see how the @BrooklynNets were getting blown out.@NBA @BrooklynNets finally a nets WI said this during the draft and I’ll say it again, how does the collective of the other 29 NBA teams allow the Brooklyn Nets to draft the NCAA D1 LEADING SCORER OF THE PREVIOUS SEASON?!?!The @nyknicks absolutely dominated for half the game against the @BrooklynNets tonight. They just forgot that there are two halves to a game.

And all of the netsEnd of the 1st Quarter and the KNICKS are scorching hot. As they made 8/ 11 from the 3 point line and are 13/ 19 from the field.
While also making 4/ 4 from the free throw line.

KD should be the mvp for making them number 1 seed#BKNvsNYK yo @KDTrey5 don't you think Ty Lue would have been a better coach for Brooklyn Nets? Look at what he's doing with that Clippers while PG and Kawhi are out. But ya'll chose Steve Nash with no head coaching experience 🤷🏾‍♂️@notorioustei @BrooklynNets Imagine when he plays Ben10 with them 😤😤😤@BrooklynNets Without Durant they are just any team. really needed@BrooklynNets Can’t blame @JHarden13 for this effort 🤷🏽‍♂️🤷🏽‍♂️🤷🏽‍♂️🤷🏽‍♂️#NYKnicks4Life but I wanna see @BrooklynNets be competitive... #KnicksTape in Da Garden!!! https://t.co/c7sdABwJ4QToday I learned that if an unvaccinated NBA player goes to play Brooklyn nets in New York they can play. No restrictions. But kyrie has has to sit out all year because it’s unsafe for him to play in the same arena against unvaccinated players. 

Wow 😳If Steve Nash is the coach of the Brooklyn nets next year the nba needs to be investigatedIts not St James Park but its pretty good. 🔥 @nyknicks @BrooklynNets #NUFC https://t.co/oj5Opi6Y8a@sixershawn @Jarvish87593839 @AllenRobinson @BrooklynNets I think trading for LeVert would've allowed us to keep Curry or Drummond. And possibly a draft pick or two.@skxmo_ @BrooklynNetcast I think that’s the main reason Beard is now a Sixer….

Not sure how the @BrooklynNets keep him as HC….New York Knicks - Brooklyn Nets

Now you can basically double Durant and it won't hurt you. 🤣

Guys never defend him at the three point line. He shrinks the court. Pick and rolls literally don't work with him!
