Basically don't trust owners to come up with good names :(The Houston Rockets James Harden had 3 blind dates in the locker room at halftime.It was an absolute pleasure being able to speak to one of the best shooters to wear a #Rockets uniform. 

He also spoke about his time, in Manila, while playing in the #PBA and more candid stories about his time in Houston. 

Personally one of my favorite episodes to date! https://t.co/sCTlnlw9eF@BradDaugherty43 @cavs @HoustonRockets Shutdown KPJ and I think our bigs can control Wood. Houston has good talent.@BradDaugherty43 @cavs @HoustonRockets Need Goodwin and Rondo to play well, and Mobley to get his offense back.  Finally Okoro needs to shut down KPJThis what we doing in H-Town @HoustonRockets 🦉 Keep blaming the coach and Wood. https://t.co/jH6AL6wMIZ@BradDaugherty43 @cavs @HoustonRockets I would like to see Brandon Goodwin get the start tonight vs the Rockets. The off seemed to have a better flow vs the Pelicans when he was in the game! Hope DG's back improves with this rest, cause the CAVS definitely need him for the stretch run into the playoffs! GO CAVS!According To League Sources, Houston Rockets Star John Wall Has Demanded To be Traded to the Los Angeles Lakers.@BradDaugherty43 @cavs @HoustonRockets Will need another strong performance from Goodwin with Garland out.
