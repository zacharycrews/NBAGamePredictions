#HEATCulture@erinkatedolan Miami Heat -4.5 first half.
Bam Adebayo over 18.5 points.
Looking at 8:30 game.2 Free FH Play’s. Hawks/Heat.. Hawks don’t match up well with Miami and aren’t a solid road team imo. Heat want to protect home court and knows Atl will come out with more energy. Like Heat FH &amp; Over here.
Heat - 4 FH
Over 113 FHMiami heat ml 🚨
I think they run it back with a solid Home Win here. This heat team has too much good defense to swarm this hawks team.

Tonight: 

🔥Heat -2.5

Miami is clearly the superior team and even with some regression they can easily cover -2.5. Memphis should win but not cover the -7.5 #GamblingTwitter https://t.co/9drdnaUqmb@DadeMadeInc @sarah_k_spence @MiamiHEAT OkayAnyone with a vice miami Heat license plate is a certified douche canoe driver.2 Teamer:

Miami Heat/ Yankees -114🏀⚾️🏀⚾️

Heat game 2 at home vs Hawks. Hawks didn’t look like they stood a chance game 1 and that’s not changing. Trae cant take on this team by himself. Yankees visit a Tigers team without Baez. Gerrit Cole on the mound.

@hooptalk918 https://t.co/gKKdsW2ijr@AndrewR70528002 @bhrisbreezy98 @WallaceJBone @sarah_k_spence Sixers are a much easier opponent than the heat.  Sixers have 1 great defender compared to all the ones that miami can use on Trae.Interesting Trae Young stats

For the season, he's averaging:
▫️4.0 fga in the restricted area
▫️4.8 in the paint

But for vs Miami:
▫️3.0 in the RA
▫️2.3 in the paint

His paint numbers almost decrease by half. The Heat do a great job preventing him from even getting insideRussillo: *goes on a 3 minute in-depth analysis of the Miami Heat defense and how it specifically is impacting Trae Young*

Bill Simmons: “Hmm. I have the list of Celtics playoff buzzer beaters.”@ATL_The_MVP @sarah_k_spence Omg! You’re “confident about this series”? 🤔 Confident that @MiamiHEAT going to win it? Yeah, us too!How did I miss this gem 💎  on the score board of @D_Bo20

60 Dimes - Miami Heat@ajrivfit @JamieTennant3 @Super_Jordan97 @NBA @MiamiHEAT @ATLHawks ok so the hawks shots 27% in game 1 while their average against the heat on the season is 34%. It’s safe to assume that number improves. Heat shoot 39% vs the hawks on the season and they shot 47% in Game 1. Their efficiency will more than likely drop.Miami HEAT play basketball tonight@HeatMakeMeSad @Heatx3sc @BamericaSZN @MiamiHEAT i will deadass make a bet with u that the heat won’t make the finals@HeatMakeMeSad @Heatx3sc @BamericaSZN @MiamiHEAT in cap@JabbaDuhHo @HeatMakeMeSad @BamericaSZN @MiamiHEAT Lmfao, you're a Fairweather fan my boy.@Boness305 @MiamiHEAT Nice to meet you QB1@NBA @MiamiHEAT I still have no idea why's miami not geting much recognition that they deserve. these guys just shut down Trae Young in game one yet these people are only talking about how Philly and Warriors's young guns are playing. goodness.@billygil I'm pretty sure that I'm going to stop listening to you guys because it's stupid homer Mike Ruiz. I get tired just to listen to him all the time complaining about the Miami heat..@ATLHawks hope to rebound in Game 2 against 
@MiamiHEAT. Then later, it's time for @ozzie and the 
@Braves to get down to business. Not a bad night in April for #ATL sports. https://t.co/ofd6MrDVK6From Udonis Haslem to Duncan Robinson, the Miami Heat have mastered winning with undrafted talent. 

In part because they have to.

Obviously it wasn’t going to be UD (I wish) but we eventually realized he was thinking of Rony Seikaly.

Relatedly they are both the #1 seeds in their respective conferences. https://t.co/ifXLilDUAeDuring the regular season, Trae Young averaged 17 drives and 17 potential assists per game. Against Miami on Sunday, those marks fell to 8 and 10.

@MiamiHEAT took game 1 from the @ATLHawks, and plan to hold down @TheTraeYoung and the rest of the team again tonight. 

Top @momentranks Players (base points):
Jimmy Butler - 39.0 points
Trae Young - 42.6 points

Re what Miami is doing on defense, those two defenders on the back line are the weak point in the scheme 

Hawks have to get those two defenders moving (as they did on this possession) to take advantage of the Heat loading up high https://t.co/xz0O55wlrl🏀Miami -7.5 (-110)

Clearly Trae Young wasn’t his normal self in Game 1 and I don’t expect the exact same thing to happen tonight. 

But this is still a matchup of a top 5 defensive team vs a bottom 5 defensive team. I’m expecting another double digit Heat win.

#LEGENDoftheMiamiHEAT #NBA75 https://t.co/LeGGGbbKBhMiami Heat fan base is absolutely delusional. They will probably win this series in five or fewer but aren't a top 4 team in the East in my book.@TheHeidiReport Climate plays a huge part.

For example, Montreal HAS to take place between June and August.

But Miami is in hurricane season then, so has to be much earlier.

Texas needs to take place in late October / November due to the heat.

TS: Bulletproof2Live@RatiodByJimmy @MiamiHEAT @CoupNBA Learn the game. Smart was the best defender on the best overall defense in the NBA. Bam should have been 4th. Gobert had best individual stats, Bridges best defender on bet team. Also Bam only played 56 games.@casualtakeking miami heat soon@RELwoods Cause Miami has been the best team in the conference and possibly in Basketball all season Lady🤦 if it wasnt for that stupid play in tournament which didnt exist not even 2 years ago Atlanta wouldnt even have made the playoffs.. The Heat have earned everything they have 💯.@SouthBeachMamba @MiamiHEAT @ATLHawks @TheTraeYoung False concern man! ACT LIKE YOU AINT SEEN KYLE DO STUFF LIKE THIS BEFORE come on man keep it a Buck!

Crash the glass

Miami is the 1 NBA team who is better at what Atlanta does best than they are

It's incredibly hilarious humans think a heliocentric #26 overall defensive team isn't going to be dismantled in 4 by a dynamic deep #4 defense with #1 3p% https://t.co/l64jL9LVZq@Cynthia24099388 @MiamiHEAT Think it depends on match up.Y’all ain’t ready for this @MiamiHEATAt this point I give zero fucks about the nba awards. The only award I want for my @MiamiHEAT is the 🏆 n rings at the end of the season. They can shove the other stuff @miaheatbeatThe Dallas Mavericks allowed an avg of 25.5 1st Quarter points at home this year. Only the Miami Heat allowed fewer in the NBA.

Jazz score 24 in 1st Q of Game 2. They had 20 in Game 1.

Solid defense but outside of Jalen Brunson (6 for 7 FG), Mavs hit 3 of 16 shots.

#MFFL @wfaaSo what’s it gonna take for the @Suns and @MiamiHEAT to get some damn respect on they’re names and players?? How does Marcus smart win DPOY when Bam Adebayo and Mikael Bridges clearly are better defenders than Smart!?? Smart wasn’t even the best defender for Boston!Williams was!Ready to spice things up?!? 🔥 You can catch me watching the @MiamiHEAT at @FTXArena with a @Bacardi Spiced Rum, Lime, &amp; Ginger Ale #cocktail and so should you.  🏀🥃🦇

#EatWithTheHeat #RumPunch#HEATPartner @ FTX Arena https://t.co/YdQdQhijc1even if we lose this series all I ask is the @MiamiHEAT take care of the sixers in 5 or 6There is no way @Bam1of1 is not a DPOY finalists:
- he had the 4th best defensive rating in the league 
- he averaged more steals per game than Mikal Birdges (who was one of the finalists)
This shows the disrespect of the media to miami.

And Giannis getting “shut down” by Miami is a stretch. 4 points off his mvp season average.

Smh. Pressure! 🎶 You had me me at hello. Can never make you happy, girl it must be the devil. Beautiful lies!” 🎶@thecubanhokage @michaelhen999 @Anthony_Chiang DPOY but yeah go on and talk like he's a scrub and haven't made his presence known in this league for years. Some Heat fans lives in their own Heat bubble and don't know anything outside of Miami Heat@IraHeatBeat NUMBERS DON’T LIE!!!

This @Bam1of1 award. Pure robbery https://t.co/wEY9NOQXXI@MatthewWords Well you are a Celtics Fan With Vote ? Look this Guy @Brendan_Tobin @MiamiHEAT@brraaanndon Now the Celtics have more stars and a better defender than Miami Heat...lmao@TheNightCruise1 @MiamiHEAT Well which explains his preheat times and baking times as well.  Microwave is seconds, Dutch oven requires an hour to preheat and 15-20 min after, which in NBA terms is a half seasonMiami Heat needs their respect for this season, the league has been very disrespectful towards the Heat, they talked more bout the lakers losing season then they did bout the number one team in the east, crazyi not mentally prepared to go back to miami this week, i can already feel the disgusting heatThe HEAT entered the 2022 Playoffs with an all-time 138-111 (.554) postseason record, the third-highest in NBA history, behind only the Lakers (.599) and Celtics (.566) per @MiamiHEAT game notes.

Follow @WaterCleanupFL@BrucieBoy70 @Random73091551 @MiamiHEAT Philly not beating us they always choke in the second round don’t get me wrong Miami hasn’t proven much since 2020 but they proven more than philly fs@cfeldz @JRAND62144973 @SRochesterNBA @kelseytaysutton @POTUS @FBI @god @NBA @SpiderMan not as irrelevant as what you said but whatever you say "gramps" I'm not a Hawks fan, sorry to disappoint you.

I just hate dirty plays like what the Miami Heat showed. I mean, who wouldn't?@Reese929IndAtl @MiamiHEAT @ATLHawks @TheTraeYoung False about the leg… ain’t no way in hell he did that to intentionally hurt Trae. It was a 100% hustle play for a loose ball. You could see Lowry literally talking to Trae afterwards with concern. The throat thing I can’t comment on because I don’t think I saw it.@ranich016 @jjimenez_132 @tyler_h15 @NBA @memgrizz @MiamiHEAT @Suns They had the mf Hawks above us in our divisionSo a team that plays defense. @MiamiHEATProof that no one watches @MiamiHEAT basketball except US!!! #HEATCulture https://t.co/BetBftdiHT@NBA @raf_tyler @MiamiHEAT @Suns @kevinlove @cavs give it to tyler already@cavssebastian2 I mean 1 day off rest while the Miami heat had a week of rest and you got dirty players in Lowry and Herro https://t.co/kBRQyR32ae@CubanMike11 @BostonArman @Brendan_Tobin @Bam1of1 Miami is surprisingly small. It's seems big because of the tourism and marketing. It's kind of like Vegas in that way. Sometimes harder to have fans in touristy places. The Heat are way overlooked though. On the other hand Phoenix is the 5th most populated city in America.@SouthBeachMamba @MiamiHEAT @ATLHawks @TheTraeYoung 😅😅😅😅😅😅

@SouthBeachMamba 

True or False:

Lowry was on Bounty time wit the Diving at the leg and the Elbow to the Throat push into the Power Forward?

Keep it a buck.@BammyBurner @AcunaPlusButler Literally the only person here not brainwashed into thinking Bam plays defense like Miami Heat LeBron ACTUALLY being able to guard 1-5Giants 7-2 in 7th haha they really are the miami heat of baseball ! https://t.co/63vDqbdhjb@LeBatardShow @MichaelRyanRuiz @MiamiHEAT What about the bucks and son's last year oh that's right Miami homerism at its finest and I gotta say keep that shit up its nice to hear from people who live in Miami and not Tampa. They are in my opinion the best overall team this year+ for the yb community I’ll keep y’all followed, and no I won’t be on HHT I’ll chillin in miami heat related Twitter if y’all wonder@LoneWolfTronCat @LeBatardShow @MichaelRyanRuiz @MiamiHEAT History only counts in mikes lifetime 😂Gotta feel for those poor small market teams like the Miami Heat… 🙄 https://t.co/OePWDjlEZb
