Because they been a Top 4 seed since 2014, and I'm not about to switch up bc of one season in Tampa with 82 road games, injuries and the whole team getting COVID.

If you’re interested in the price DM and I’ll hook you up 😁 #TakeNote https://t.co/N2oiTMtuPs@vhstxssy @RichieWiggles @SportsTake8 @Primetime_jet Miami’s Defense (which includes Bam) was easily the best vs Giannis in the Bucks’ finals run. It was simply a lack of offense. If the Heat had played even semi good offense, it woulda been a sweep the other way. In conclusion, Bam is still Giannis’ father. https://t.co/Hxnm7Q7WxJ@kirkgoldsberry @MiamiHEAT @warriors @chicagobulls @utahjazz Interesring how nets better at defense than attack@kirkgoldsberry @MiamiHEAT @warriors @chicagobulls @utahjazz A team with James Harden being better on defense then on offense@AProskauer @kirkgoldsberry @MiamiHEAT @warriors @chicagobulls @utahjazz Fournier isn't a bad defender@kirkgoldsberry @MiamiHEAT @warriors @chicagobulls @utahjazz Jason Kidd has somehow ruined an offense centered on Luka Doncic.Miami Heat - Boston Celtics  Metric Simulations Preview and Analysis | 熱... https://t.co/GQHTWxecv5 via @YouTube https://t.co/Lmtc1LJjjaNew No. 1: Miami Heat, Chicago Bulls, Los Angeles Lakers, Philadelphia 76ers Toronto Raptors and Sacramento Kings move up while Milwaukee Bucks, Charlotte Hornets and Atlanta Hawks fall in this week's NBA power rankings.

And a team with Luka as the 27th offence@kirkgoldsberry @MiamiHEAT @warriors @chicagobulls @utahjazz 1. Second round of East will be fiercer than second round of West.
2. Sixers offense can sing when they're not playing an All-Star who can't shoot.
3. Who knew a Jason Kidd offense would suck? Besides everyone?
4. Expand the league to 32!@kirkgoldsberry @MiamiHEAT @warriors @chicagobulls @utahjazz Small sample but top quadrant is 4 EC teams and 2 WC teams...@kirkgoldsberry @MiamiHEAT @warriors @chicagobulls @utahjazz @LeviChappell @ChappellBros Love this kind of stuffDetroit Pistons - Philadelphia 76ers

Wild how things have changed@MiamiHEAT I'm so frustrated trying to stream Heat games here in Broward County. How are you guys watching our new smoking hot team?

Sorry was a church. 😂With the Chicago Bulls losing, your @MiamiHEAT are in sole possession of 1st place in the Eastern Conference. LETS GO. #HEATCultureBulls Lost, Knicks Lost, Wizards Lost! What a great night for the Miami Heat and we didn’t even play 😁 take care of business tomorrowWith the bulls losing tonight.

If (and when) the HEAT were to win tomorrow..

There will be a whole game between the 1st and the 2nd positions in the eastern conference standings for the first time for the season.

Miami would be alone on top the East.The @MiamiHEAT are in sole possession of 1st place in the Eastern Conference! 😤 #HeatCultureThe Miami Heat OFFICIALLY hold the #1 seed in the Eastern Conference.Forget records….teams playin the best.  In the East….Miami Heat.  They seem super balanced and tough as well.  They added Lowry, the Morris Twin, PJ Tucker..They still have Jimmy Bucketz, and the 2 shooters, they should be there at the end.YOUR MIAMI HEAT ARE OFFICIALLY THE BEST SEED IN THE EASTERN CONFERENCE🔥🔥🔥🔥The Celtics had a decent win margin but that game was UGLY. Play like that and the Celts get smashed in Miami. Looking at a big play on the Heat Thursday.Great Celtics win but I refused to get emotionally excited based off a win vs possibly the worst team in the East, and def a bottom 5 team in the league at the very least, only to be let down. Want me to buy in? Beat the Heat tomorrow. So nice W, but on to Miami…#BleedGreenAfter the Bulls loss to the Sixers, the Miami Heat now have sole possession of the first seed in the East. https://t.co/d2lZqfETcZ@ChipTurnerPA @TioSamSays @tropicalblanket After the fact for sure, but in 2019 the only team that would have dumped simmons for butler was possibly the Miami heat and that isn’t a sure thing !  Until these playoffs that just passed everyone thought simmons was flawed but still a potential superstar top 15 ish playerprepare for the jays @MiamiHEATCan’t wait till he got a Miami Heat jersey on #FreeJa https://t.co/Or0MPIVWMpDallas coach and Hall of Famer Jason Kidd on Miami’s 125-110 win against the Mavericks on Tuesday:

#NBATwitter • #NBA75 • #HEATCulture https://t.co/jbOH8lZlP9@urpalnick @statmuse @MiamiHEAT He has been doing this sh*t since he was a rookie and was more visible when he got starter mins back in 2019-20 season. Nobody pays attention to it coz people see all the time are blocks &amp; steals stats. Bam’s defensive goals are always to make them miss and not blocks &amp; steals.Normally I'd want the Cs to stay in Orlando and not go to Miami for a night or partying but right now? Go get nuts, unfuck the vibes, clear the mind, do a bunch of Molly and play the Heat tomorrow with the immaculate vibes known as "Not Giving A Shit"13 point win vs Orlando and Celtics end three game losing streak!
Tomorrow huge game vs Miami Heat!Much needed win for Boston. Not much else to say. Big test tomorrow in Miami against the 6-1 Heat.@MiamiHEAT Nah whoever made this video needs a raise this is fantasticBulls about to lose the to 76ers.

1. Philadelphia 76ers

2. Miami Heat
