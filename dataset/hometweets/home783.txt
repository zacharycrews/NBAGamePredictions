They won Game 3.

Between those games, Fred Jr. was born. Pure inspiration for Fred Sr.

After that, VanVleet went on a historic tear to help beat the Bucks.

The Raptors went to the NBA Finals for the 1st time in history.Fred's agent said three words that changed Fred's life when considering the offers.

Bet on yourself.

Believing those words, Fred turned down the D-League deals and bet on his skills, training and future.

Lucky were the @Raptors.

Fred signed a summer league deal w/ them.@wojespn BREAKING: Steve Balmer buys Toronto @Raptors and relocates entire team to LA in attempt to gain hoop cred.Really love @FredVanVleet of @Raptors making his first AllStar Game.

Brah was self assured,prepared and walked and talked like an AllStar even then.Spoke his success into existence💪🏽👏🏽The @Raptors would get a vet in his prime with a declining salary ($21.3M, $19.6M $17.9M &amp; $16.1M). They could give THJ time to recover, maybe he´s even ready for the playoffs. The @dallasmavs get a vet playmaker who can score and the option to re-sign him cheap#Dragic #Hardaway https://t.co/tYenujENxC@BlakeMurphyODC did a wonderful job this morning describing what Fred VanVleet has done and what he means to @Raptors on @FAN590.  Spot on. https://t.co/Qo3HI2xr9bI’m hearing @TheTraeYoung going to go OD against the @Raptors tonight.. we will see. @Raptors win or lose still proud of y’allNext years Clippers are the 2019 Championship Raptors + Paul George. Nice? Yes. Better? No.

No Siakam. No end of prime Gasol. No Lowry. No FVV. No OG. No Nick Nurse AKA no net-new Box &amp; 1. No Toronto fanbase. No lucky McCaw. An aging Ibaka. 

Their plan won't work.@ScriptsByJames You have to admit that it makes the front office's job a WHOLE lot easier when their team is located in Miami. We've seen multiple players who were drafted or traded to teams in Toronto (and Vancouver) just refuse to report. And that puts the Raptors at a serious disadvantage.Shoutout to @KendrickPerkins giving props to @FredVanVleet on #NBAToday. Freddy V is the heart and soul of the @Raptors. @Klow7 paved the way, mentoring Fred to step into Toronto’s next leadership role. 👊🏼👏🏼 #NBAAllStar@RichardWBlais @Raptors Thanks for inquiring! We'll reach out to our team and get back to you about this.@ATLHawks  vs @Raptors

I remember when I was trying to play pro overseas a few years back and was also an undersized guard who took an unconventional route, FVV was someone I looked up to a lot. Super deserved. #nba #torontoraptors #NBAAllStarNeed some betting tips on the Raptors-Hawks tonight?

Like it’s no surprise that this would happen bc the NBA always overlooks and disrespects the Toronto Raptors as the only non-U.S. team in the league, especially the media. Y’all are straight 🗑.@ctsbulls @Raptors @DeMar_DeRozan I loved Williams while he was at Villanova. Once he got in to Toronto it was hard to catch him on TV as they were never really televised locally.Chicago Bulls vs Toronto Raptors - Full Game Highlights | February 3, 20... https://t.co/ZYfntX2eQt @YouTubeIncredible story of success. Starting from nothing to becoming a champion and an All-Star. @FredVanVleet took his opportunity and bet on himself. Great day to be a @Raptors fan. #WeTheNorth https://t.co/dPTI6PhsVs@leo_kljajic @NBAAllStar @Raptors @FredVanVleet I am from Toronto and have watched every single Raptor and Hornet game this year as those are the 2 teams I support. With all due respect to FVV, should they swap LaMelo for FVV, Raptors are a contender...@DKDWright @NBAAllStar @Raptors @FredVanVleet That's why people actually watch games instead of peeking at the box score after every game.Toronto finished with 113 FG attempts, while the Bulls had 90. The Raptors also had 22 offensive rebounds, compared to 10 for Chicago. Chicago committed 17 turnovers, leading to 22 points for the Raptors.https://t.co/9IFiAT2Duh@FredVanVleet @Raptors Congrats, Fred!! Earned!February 4-2 (+1.16u)

Everyone understands this, including the coaches who voted in FVV.

Are you OK? You seem lost.@Raptors Dont bottle this man1) Toronto Police NOT directing healthcare workers to not wear uniforms

2) The preemptive fearmongering on the rally stems from some excessive honking tickets

3) Raptors parade shutting down the downtown core and all traffic

4) Gardiner shut down by protesters in 2009 https://t.co/waaM5eqko7 https://t.co/lk5AAADAwKthe #Raptors had seven guys score the basketball and Nick Nurse has played 9 guys already, no surprise why the team did pretty decent and is up at the half, #Toronto needs to shoot better from the 3 though, only 4/17 #WeTheNorth@Raptors Tell siakam to stop shootin 3s@blogTO 1) Toronto Police NOT directing healthcare workers to not wear uniforms

@raptors #wethenorth #RTZ #gamespeaks@you_bums_fr @NBAAllStar @Raptors @FredVanVleet You don't think it says a lot about a player's effort at the defensive end that a guy 6' (at most) and at least 7" shorter averages more blocks?

Says a lot about which of the two plays hard on D and which doesn't. The kind of stuff that coaches notice and care about.It's the second defensive possession of the game and Toronto leaves Green wide open under the basket. Team doesn't even know their player assignments? Defensively, mentally, the Raptors are a disappointment this year.
