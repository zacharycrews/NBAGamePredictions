Chicago must know that they have to double Giannis by now but in this clip, help comes too late.

Next play, a simple DHO from Giannis gives Wes Matthews a wide open 3. Bulls can’t find the answers to limiting Giannis’ impact. https://t.co/BQp1XzqCaU@chicagobulls @advocatehealth @Klarna @united Please don’t lose by 30@chicagobulls @zennioptical @ZachLaVine Hopefully he actually makes shots@chicagobulls @zennioptical @ZachLaVine That girl picking a wedgie for sure https://t.co/kPJzabMhIBI just called work to say I'll show up 2hrs later.

The Bulls look to rebound today after a crushing loss in game 3. Milwaukee are 4.5 pt road favorites, and are 5-1 ATS in their last 6 road games.

In the off-season, I unload Tristan, DJJ, and Coby White. 

Lonzo will be back. Caruso to the bench with Ayo.

Sign PF Robert Covington and C Isaiah Hartenstein.
Cov a 3 and D guy.

Doesn't help that Lonzo is out, our starting PG. Caruso would be coming off the bench.

Just look at the 3 years in Chicago when Jordan "retired" and went to baseball. The Bulls were bad with just Pippen. And Kobe won at least 1 ring without Shaq. He won with Gasol, Artest, Odom, and Bynum.Build through the draft and smart trades/off-season signings.

The Milwaukee Bucks, Cleveland Cavaliers and even Detroit Pistons all of whom are a Divisional Rival of my Chicago Bulls... have completed and/or have started the "process" the right way and I love seeing it!@BullsMuse_ The Chicago Bulls accomplished their goal. They won 1 playoff game. Bags are packed.  Effort in game 3 was all you needed to know.Meanwhile even @chicagobulls of MJ struggled when he came mid season out of form when @SHAQ and @Iam1Cent showed them the way out. @BrooklynNets go back to the drawing board we'll be waiting until then byeMaront = Rose as a @chicagobulls fan I feel bad for @memgrizzThe @celtics are yoked right now. @Bucks need two more wins to beat the loser @chicagobulls .The Celtics v Bucks series will be a great eastern semis #probablygonnalose #dangit#Bulls-#Bucks rivalry?

He asked for a trade later down the road and tried to get to Chicago again.@Shisnoh @begood4905 @chicagobulls Yes agreed the people at United Center were ready to explode with excitement, but then the bulls went MIA. I also bought my tickets when they dropped (during the time the bulls were losing game after game) so my expectations weren’t ever high. I just want them to compete!PICK UP LAMARCUS ALDRIDGE  @chicagobulls@Gray_Ry @begood4905 @chicagobulls If they lost by 30 and they worked their asses off, I wouldnt care. But they gave up after the first quarter. There was no fight@begood4905 @Shisnoh @chicagobulls Im not mad that we lost on Friday I mean I’m also going to game 4, but the bulls gave up on us. I don’t care about winning or losing but I wanna see effort. This a pic I took of Zach completely skipping the timeout. I was just making a joke out of my frustration over their effort https://t.co/F7eiaeBnR8https://t.co/gnmqg3dWJo NBA Playoffs First Round - Game 3: Milwaukee Bucks vs Chicago Bulls (Live Play-By-Play &amp; Reactions) https://t.co/scD3D9bkHr https://t.co/KgeGggtKj1@steve0108 @chicagobulls The apathetic, bricklaying group keen on playing absolute poop defensive and very subpar O.Crazy Fact Most People Didn't Know #1: 
In 1994, revealed by George Karl, coach of the Sonics, the Chicago Bulls offered Shawn Kemp for Scottie Pippen. Given the potential of Kemp and the fact that he was four years younger than Pippen, the Supersonics rejected Bulls proposal. https://t.co/V6JygSUo4t@chicagobulls Pain. I feel pain. Like how was that effort and output even a possibility Friday? Story of my fandom (most probably) is I get a glimmer of hope and try to feed off it. ie game 2. Then yesterday’s game plays out and I just don’t understand how a performance like that is possible?@AmandaHilden Ok that's better..hey Chicago bulls won 114 at the mil bucks!!..it was awesome https://t.co/FuqYUuTsfZ1986-87 Fleer Michael Jordan Rookie Card RC 57 PSA 5 Chicago Bulls EX T683

In order for Chicago to stand a chance, more guys need to play better, that includes PAW, Zach, Coby, Ayo, etc.

If Zach wants the max contract, he needs to be better.

That was brutal@TH14burner @chicagobulls @patricklw4 You are right, however, having played sports for a long time, as I am sure you did as well, some people just never develop an aggressiveness in sport which limits their ceiling.
