Orlando once had a streak where they won 15 out if 17, the biggest win during that stretch came in 2009.

The Magic got a 95-73 win, where Tony Battie led the team with 21points.

You are by far the best Orlando Magic journalist and will miss reading your magic coverage 😞I have something to say, and it’s personal: On Monday, I’ll begin covering the Washington Wizards for @TheAthletic.
