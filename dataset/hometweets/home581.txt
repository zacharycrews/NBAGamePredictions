The Detroit Pistons are the Detroit Pistons historically.
It is important to know that. To guard yourself from that.

And the Detroit Pistons. I would also say Oregon State Beavers but that is just personal bias and nostalgia.Just see how many former Pistons greats have continued relevance after the nba compared to other small markets.  Just saying....  

Not saying There is a big chance Mitchell comes to Detroit....  now there is no chance.Pistons markers may suck very hard right now and Jazz fans might be the most loyal amount of crackers nba ever seen.  But at least when Detroit is great, our fans make the market bigger than it is. That is just undeniable https://t.co/MtrQo6uvF4@Dan_Savage @OrlandoMagic @DetroitPistons The @OrlandoMagic should hire someone just to do PT and training for the left side of every player.
