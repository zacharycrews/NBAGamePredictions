There were some great players on that Nets team but the team got put together 5 years late. Lakers losing to the Warriors, Hawks, Suns or Thunder cause of age. Of course you can't defend when you are relying on 35 year olds.I hope Brooklyn Net would stop Suns.

And again, doesn't matter if America's evil or not, now does it?@Buat99570018 @Harryel052289 @johndoe514 @trengzurchmydga @EnesKanter @BrooklynNets @joetsai1999 And i know you're trying to say America's lying about it because they want to get China in trouble or some BS. The only thing is, there's far more proof of the CCP's evils than America's. I could just as easily use your excuse and say "ThAt WaS mAdE uP bY tHe CcP" lol@Buat99570018 @Harryel052289 @johndoe514 @trengzurchmydga @EnesKanter @BrooklynNets @joetsai1999 Again, America's evil disproves China's evil how?@EnesKanter @BrooklynNets @joetsai1999 Laughing stock considering you are a CIA asset, Joe isn't going to purchse you.@Alisaisil @EnesKanter @BrooklynNets @joetsai1999 Good point, that extremists also admitted he had lied.@89Kkpbnx6Ba4WX0 @EnesKanter @BrooklynNets @joetsai1999 And since you were so anti-Communist, I pointed out who was behind the opposition: feudal lords, warlords, opium dealers, &amp; foreigners@89Kkpbnx6Ba4WX0 @EnesKanter @BrooklynNets @joetsai1999 Actually, you were parroting anti-Communist nonsense &amp; I pointed out how much better the Chinese ppl were after the Civil War. Then u made some false claims about the # of ppl who died in the Civil War &amp; some other strawman about China existing before the 1890s. Foolishness.@dk_nice1 When they do change it you gotta catch a game in Brooklyn bro.

He got that 15 minutes off the bench because of politicing and showed he needs to be back on the bench@YourUncleAnton @BrooklynNets @Patty_Mills what@Matt_with_a_W @gmocrick @stephenasmith @FirstTake @BrooklynNets @StephenCurry30 Kyrie is showing that he doesn't care about his teammates/fans nor  a contract for which he signed on to do a job and get paid for, over a lame stand against getting a vaccine? We all had to get vaccines to go to highschool and college measles/mumps/polio/ tetanus, c'mon..See you tomorrow in Brooklyn. #Suns #Nets #NBA75 https://t.co/vEexQd3B8PSometimes I wish I was a Knicks fan just so I could randomly yell “Bing-Bong” at people throughout the day. (I still do this)

I’m gonna need a similar phrase for @BrooklynNets fans STAT@YourUncleAnton @BrooklynNets @Patty_Mills @spurs would never!Brooklyn Nets paid another team to take DeAndre Jordan away from them btw1971-72 Lakers 33

The @Suns currently at 15 coming up on franchise rec 2006-07 Suns at 17 led by @BrooklynNets MVP @SteveNash 18.6 pts 11.6 a@EnesKanter @BrooklynNets @joetsai1999 I think @joetsai1999 cant talk about this coz he was censored in China, his family and friends goin dangered if he goin to talk against the govt, he needs an alliance and assurance from EU/US support. We need good strategic how to convince China..How good is the #NBA Western Conference?
#Suns have won 15 in a row (and 16 of first 19 games)…….and they are not in first place!
Suns play #BrooklynNets tomorrow. Gonna be a really good game.

It’s clear as day. They talk out of their a$$ about China and then they excuse it all by saying they’re “just” against the govt..it’s a joke@Suns  go to  16- 3  with a  118-97  21 pt blowout  victory over  the  New York Knicks as the @Suns win their 15 game in a row up next  14-5 Brooklyn Nets @BrooklynNets  #SunsvsNets #ValleyProudArjee smith Brooklyn nets eastern conference Brooklyn in the house 🏠 https://t.co/uaQefX4oPU@ComethFor @Rebecca_Bellado @EnesKanter @BrooklynNets @joetsai1999 The devil is on the details you genius.. just because Mao screwed the country with his tragic polices doesn’t mean every leader/member of their govt was “evil”..quite the contrary in fact..that’s the mind boggling disconnect that you people have when judging China from afarFifteen in a row for the @Suns!☀️

He is an all around integral, intelligent, incredible, talented &amp; skilled asset to the @BrooklynNets.
He is doing what Jesus &amp; God want &amp; need him to be doing.

Imagine all the mental, emotional, physical, spiritual &amp;My @JHarden13 @BrooklynNets jersey came in babyyyy https://t.co/qNXlPGRl3IPhoenix Suns will bring their 15 game winning streak to Brooklyn tomorrow night. 

Awaiting them is James Harden, Kevin Durant, &amp; the Nets.

The last time BKN played PHX, Harden dropped 38-11-7 to lead the Nets to a 24-point comeback win in the desert as the lone star. https://t.co/6jYG69GorsI felt that the celtics played well against Brooklyn.  Couldn't make anything.  Some fringe nets players had unexpected performances.  The tony brothers impact.  

Tonite they are truly awful on both ends. Zero energy.@EnesKanter @BrooklynNets @joetsai1999 Come live in China, lets see how big your mouth is. The people in China can not say anything against the CCP for fear of torture or maybe even death, they do believe in the righteousness and value of life, just their hands are tied. Chinese people are not all bad!@LilCoopG @Ballislife @blakegriffin23 makes basketball &amp; everything better.
He’s an all around integral, intelligent, skilled &amp; talented asset to the @BrooklynNets.
Hoping &amp; praying everything turns up in Blake’s favour.Game 19 of the 2021-2022 #BostonCeltics season. Brooklyn Nets @ Boston CelticsI can’t wait for the @BrooklynNets vs Suns game tomorrow, let’s end there winning streak! 😤💪🏽 #NetsWorld@daniggler @Ballislife I LOVE @blakegriffin23’s moves.
