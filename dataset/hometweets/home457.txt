Deny it all you want. Just like Miami did exact same thing bucks did with BOGI trade. Bucks get trade denied lose second round pick and monetary fine. Heat just lose 2nd. It’s pathetic and obvious. Use your brain@MiamiHEAT Thats not goodAccording to my research, the Sixers' 1 bench point in victory is the second fewest in NBA history.

The record-holder? The 37-45 Miami Heat, who scored 0 in a 105-101 victory over the 18-64 Sixers in game 82 in 2015.@lisssalove @MiamiHEAT Right! So i feel like they’re not saying what’s really going on with him. 😫@DonMadridiot @TakeAShilllPill Fun fact i saw the Celtics play Miami heat once@SLAMonline @NBA @MiamiHEAT  This is cuteRookie guard Chris Duarte got some extra shots up earlier today before the #Pacers caught a flight to Miami.
