The results are consistently poor. There is organization-deep rot, here. Every league has a few teams like this. Sacramento Kings come to mind in the NBA. Coaching changes are futile band-aids.

Houston wins the opening tip over 70% of the time compared to just 42% of the time for Sacramento. It turns into a toss-up after the first shot is up, but Houston should get that opportunity.

Date : Sunday, January 16, 2022 - Time : 6:00 PMIf I’m Leon Rose I’m hitting up Sacramento about trading for Fox. Rose &amp; Kemba can’t stay healthy, Quickley’s still developing. Kings have done nothing for him &amp; they’re stupid enough of a front office for us to get a favorable trade. We won the Reddish trade, why not this? https://t.co/ecHFWm1FQLthe @SacramentoKings haven’t made playoffs in 16 years but, hey, they made SNL. https://t.co/c92jgD4Jvh@TrillBroDude @SacramentoKings @ATLHawks Demands a double team on the block. What a playerWhy @nbcsnl do my @SacramentoKings like that we just beat the @Lakers with @KingJamesThat pass will be very good in Sacramento @SacramentoKings … y’all need Donte ???

Couldn't you mock the Clippers?Laugh all you want 

THE SACRAMENTO KINGS ARE ON NATIONAL TV BAYBEEEEE 

ANYTHING IS POSSSSSSSIBLECan we make this happen @SacramentoKings https://t.co/RNedrmWizj@BigRorDawg The Sacramento media has  always given anyone part of the Kings a pass when it comes to off court issues. They (the media) dont want to be frozen out by asking about the off court stuff.I watched that Sacramento game and Malik Monk contained the Kings guards in single almost every single time in the halfcourt what’s this man smoking, it’s transition where Fox was an issue but you need a wall to guard Fox in transitionI don't get this skit, was the entire team of the Sacramento Kings put in quarantine for Covid ?

#SNLThe Sacramento Kings are currently catching the most unnecessary, hilarious stray on Saturday Night Live. 

Your franchise could never. 💅 https://t.co/jhWsnRBV7xI’d really like to know why SNL chose to roast the Sacramento Kings. Like, which writer pitched it and why?
