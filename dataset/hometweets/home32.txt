Defense is already looking better and I expected Dame &amp; Cj to take a sec to compensate for more defense while finding offense. Seems every game we are playing run and 3 teams 👀The Portland Trail Blazers#AEWDynamite**Premium #7**     10-23-21

#Betting #FreePicks https://t.co/OnQS7AoKRmPretty sure @fuboTV is the worst streaming option known to man after a few weeks of use to try to watch the @trailblazers.

I'm cancelling and will not be able to watch blazers games now. Major screwup by the blazersI think this is the year that Jokic gets tired of being hacked on and thrown to the ground all game long and finally goes full gorilla panic on some chump from the @trailblazers or something.Yeah that’s a stick on fire that @CamasHighSchool student is throwing up in the air and catching. Hey @trailblazers, I found your next half time show! https://t.co/CETX3F8fSkSeeing Melo not in a @trailblazers  jersey just seems.... wrong.@Diegodi13515595 @gtrentjr @Ravens @trailblazers I believe in you manCircle 6
