Serious question@sitefeniseni3 @nyknicks i would switch Bamba with Mitch depending on who's playing better but i can rock with that lineup if we're building for the future@ThePootisnator @nyknicks historic 2 point game 🔥🔥@connvealmorris @nyknicks So y they vaccinated??

Not a playoff team still@nyknicks Play him@nyknicks Thibs move, he’s gonna play him 10 minutes. His response, “well you know, I just wanted him to get his feet wet with the other guys around him” as Knox who was benched for us is over in Atlanta playing meaningful minutes playing great defense.@hhpthebook @nyknicks I 100% see your point, and honestly a big part of me agrees with it, *but* I'm minded to give the reigning COTY a little longer to figure things out.

Rejoice (or drink) accordingly 😅@alanhahn @KeyJayandMax @TMKSESPN @nyknicks Randle has a negative attitude to refs &amp; fans. This hurts his play &amp; team.

A player drawing a double team means someone is open. Ju needs to make better decisions with the ball if the offense is going to run through him.  The ball is faster than the player, so move it.

 Since Thibs should be focusing on developing a team that can have sustained success down the line.
Instead Thibs is playing veterans like Burks, Noel, Taj and forgot about the development of the younger Knicks.@hhpthebook @nyknicks This is the best Knicks take I seen in a while.

Our group was able to connect and network with over 20 organizations including the USPBL, New York Knicks, and Washington Football Team!

#sportsasajob #ferrisstate https://t.co/cg7QNHaZOz@alliejr @hhpthebook @nyknicks It’s crazy that people think it’s a good idea to keep slogging through coaches. Franchises need stability to get and a stay good.@hhpthebook @nyknicks But maybe you can’t blame the cook when they’re serving you old steak. I think our struggles are more related to a shitty roster that was over performing last year, and snapped back to reality this year.
Let’s face it, our starting 5 is janky at best right now.@nyknicks LET’S GO KNICKS!!!@_SportsNut @hhpthebook @nyknicks He hasn’t elevated people or his team. If the Knicks got him for a great price I’d be happy but I’m not sold on him being a savior at all.@hhpthebook @nyknicks Everything in the world cannot be simplified to a marketing model. Coaches need time to set a culture and make his pieces work. We’re all frustrated, but we don’t need another coaching change.@cillejones @nyknicks And that explains why Thibs shouldn't be coach. He'd Rather play Burks out of position because of his size, than Deuce. Burks isn't a PG he just tall. Deuce is a PG but he's smaller. Only in Thivs mind this makes sense.Both of the PG's New York drafted in the second round of the 2021 draft (Rokas Jokubaitis and Deuce McBride) have impressed team executives and greatly exceeded expectations this season.

Is the #Knicks' Point Guard of the Future Already On Their Roster?

https://t.co/6v3NJU14nO@BoomBapRadio @nyknicks My point is, regardless of how you view it...it is a product. I don't know what you do for a living, but putting a bad product out is a recipe for disaster. As fans were emotional,  I get it. But my brain is logical and I see them as a brand. This brand isn't good right now.@nyknicks This will be painful@hhpthebook @nyknicks Great analogy. But Thibs didn't want Kemba thought he was too small. Don't know about Fournier but my issue is yes the offense drags too often but he's become too lenient. You forgive things when everyone is #engaged. Last yr. the whole team spouted "no D, no play." What happened@Drulz @NBA_NewYork Heard on NBA radio this morning that Kenny Payne/Asst. Coaches are Kentucky and been covering/playing nice w Randle;so Thibs did pick his staff 🙄but Thibs still the head coach &amp; he needs to hold Randle accountable so Knicks😡@strawman1986 @sny_knicks @SNYtv @nyknicks @J30_RANDLE 💯 It’s a bad call by the coach and management. If @J30_RANDLE can’t handle adversity, he is not cut out for NY. He needs to put his head down, play ball and take ownership when the team is not playing well. That is what leaders do. Not hide and act like a petulant child.@nyknicks Play Cam over 5 minutes@hhpthebook @nyknicks But, this ain’t a night out. Look at all New York teams. The one thing that is consistent is not winning and a constant change in coaching. Sometimes you have to buy in and let a coach get his program together.@My_business_man @nyknicks Really?

It is crazy to me that mark hasn't gotten another job@hhpthebook @nyknicks I don't think you can fix a coach who is stubborn and won't play certain people because he likes vets or certain people.

I'm not going to say "Be patient with the cook, he's better than the last cook " is Thibs better than Fizdale? Yes, but is being better than Fizdale the bar? The @nyknicks is a product and subject to scrutiny.@coachjay_vee @Muhammad__2nd @nyknicks You know what's not going on in practice..Burks getting better as a point guard, Randle not turning the ball over, Randle not posting down low. Thibs not telling Randle stop bringing the ball up. And it's obvious we know what's going on in practice  because we see it in the games@NBA_NewYork Probably an 8. Which is higher than every single Knicks coach since Mike Woodson in 2012-13. Mike Miller did solid a few years ago, gets a 5 from me.

#baskettips #basketprediction #basketballbets #nba #usabasketFelt, after last year, Knicks could win if he was your No. 2, 3.

There’s pressure. https://t.co/vhLhGkr5Lw@MelaineVCryBaby @nyknicks First, I've been a @nyknicks fan for 40 years. And secondly a double and triple team, what games are you watching? The reason it's easy  for teams to guard him, is because he's posting at the 3 pt line. Stop it. Just say you don't know basketball@UncleRax Yeah sleeper Atlanta Hawks, or this year's New York Knicks.@NBA_NewYork 6. Started of on fire, cooling down. Needs to get this @nyknicks team back on the path to victory.@hhpthebook @nyknicks For sure get out from Randle with  any trade if someone will take his contract.

Im so tired of the Obi fan boys just making stuff up@NBA_NewYork 6.5/10

He clearly brought a gameplan and #knicks, mostly, now play good basketball

But his inability to hold accounatble some playerS and inability to give minutes to players that need burn when things are going south, is a HUGE issue that need to be adressed...NEW YORK TRIP

But at one point l did. 

Dude's an arrogant and conceited prick. 

To your point, Knicks need to do something with starting lineup.  Randle's clearly not the same player that he was last season.@hhpthebook @nyknicks You right but to add context Hawks interim coach was a real coach with a resume. Thibs was the wrong fit for the talent we had though@nyknicks OBI NEEDS MORE MINUTES , trade randle , and TAJ GETS TOO MANY MINUTES@nyknicks please hire mark jackson@nyknicks Hope it’s at the charity stripe.@RICwithnoK @hhpthebook @nyknicks Dude he’s the head coach. Jesus. We get it. U all hate Thibs Bc he won’t play Obi more.@MarkMartindale If one of the New York mlb teams is in the playoffs definitely try and do that!

Essentially we can just hire a fan.@hhpthebook @nyknicks Randle may have to go. But I think id like to see Thibs do his work when he literally can't rely so heavily on Randle. May be able to right the ship.@chrismo12365268 @hhpthebook @nyknicks Not really. The head coach usually isn’t helping a player train in the offseason. That’s on the player and his people around him.@finds_you_well @NYKnicksPodcast @hhpthebook @nyknicks Yea bro not sure if you’re in tuned to what actually happened , this is his OWN player advocating about it https://t.co/fEN51zX0WV@NYKnicksPodcast @finds_you_well @hhpthebook @nyknicks You missed what I said in the tweet , “for no reason”.Those are other examples of having a narrative, Casey kept getting owned by the Cavs and they knew how Derozan felt for him so they both got packed. Lebron just didn’t like actually being coached so he went the Ty lue route.@Monte_Xristo @NBA_NewYork Funny u say that when the Knicks went on a 9 game win streak and ended the year 16-4 which was all after Woodson. Not saying Woodson leaving was the cause of it but him leaving is not the reason we suck@NAJEEZUS @finds_you_well @hhpthebook @nyknicks Cavs and raptors fired their coaches after 50 win seasons too. It happens.@nyknicks @RjBarrett6 Who would buy a a Jersey for this bum LOLOLOLOL@hhpthebook @nyknicks Thibs is not the prob! Does he need 2b a lil more flexible, make some adjustment sure. Coach change is bad for development. That wld put it at 4 in 4 yrs f/RJ! This notion that he dont play kids is crazy! Mitch, RJ, IQ &amp; now Grimes=kids! Others need 2 improve &amp; they’ll play more!@hhpthebook @nyknicks Bro I been saying this. Thibs is to us what mark jackson was to the warriors. We just need to find our Steve Kerr@finds_you_well @NYKnicksPodcast @hhpthebook @nyknicks I said what I said. There was a forced narrative for Jackson that got him fired. You don’t get packed up after a 50 win season for no reason.@NYKnicksPodcast @hhpthebook @nyknicks Yea as a Kemba fan I have to agree. I think the Knicks were banking on him and rose to play short minutes off  each other. He shows flashes of his old self but Thibs is stuck on his ways to play him 30 plus minutes a game. That’s a no no.@hhpthebook @nyknicks Players like @drose @TajGibson believe in coach Thibs.  I’m rockin wit them!!💪🏾🙌🏾🥃🤷🏽‍♂️ #Knicks 4 life regardless #ShitAintEasy 💯@NAJEEZUS @hhpthebook @nyknicks True Kemba is a PG but it’s a very short term solution, his knee is way too messed up to rely on@hhpthebook @nyknicks I’m not ready to fire Thibs yet…. But I would love to have Mark Jackson and a legit PG…. In the meantime a legit PG will do!!@NYKnicksPodcast @hhpthebook @nyknicks You notice how good Mitch is in the pick and roll? Randle needs to play off balls, he’s strong and left handed he could easily score off ball. Idk why he wants to dribble so much.@NYKnicksPodcast @hhpthebook @nyknicks The Knicks have point guards. The Knicks don’t have plays. Listen I’m taking off my bias hat for Kemba. But if you give him screens and commit to pick and rolls this team would be elite. I went to the last game and watched the team as a collective run iso. Randle didn’t move.@hhpthebook @nyknicks Ok so I’m assuming ur a fan of Obi and IQ. Who should we talk to about them getting better. Obi was unplayable last year. This year while he still has major flaws he at least looks like he is allowed in the NBA. Does the head coach not get any credit for player development?@nyknicks Make any trade to get rid of Randle,but get a very good player@Schultz975 How those @nyknicks doing ?@finds_you_well @NYKnicksPodcast @hhpthebook @nyknicks You know he took those guy when they were super young to the western semis? He literally predicted them to be the greatest shooting duo of all time. I don’t like politics in sports but they def blackballed him.@NYKnicksPodcast @hhpthebook @nyknicks Yea he did terribly bad starting Burks at the point. You know he did that to endorse a Point Randle ? I’m for the grimes minutes tho, that wasn’t really an adjustment Thibs would be stupid not o playing grimes while the team dealt with injury.@NAJEEZUS @hhpthebook @nyknicks He benched Kemba, and started giving Grimes mins@antpoet1 @nyknicks Randle has to grow up...@EricSaintCroix @hhpthebook @nyknicks Ignite a spark***@nyknicks Quickley THE 🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡I love kemba walker but @nyknicks can we please trade him for @JohnWall #nba #Trending@EricSaintCroix @hhpthebook @nyknicks Agreed!

Wife: Bing bong!Curry's season so far Pt. 10

On the bright lights of Madison Square Garden, Stephen Curry made history by becoming the NBA's all-time three-point leader. He finished with 22 points and 5 three-pointers against the New York Knicks on December 14, 2021.

#StephenCurry #NBAAllStar https://t.co/u7eGWLvUIY@TaraSetmayer @RexChapman @nyknicks Charles Oakley is a bad man.@RexChapman @nyknicks I loved the 1960’s Knicks, too!@hhpthebook @nyknicks I don't think Mark Jackson makes a difference. I can ride the Randle for Fox trade especially with how Randle is handling things. Thibs is not the problem look at how he did not give up on Evan and the dude is decent hence reliable now.@jaek_up @nyknicks Agree 100%@NBA_NewYork I can’t put the nostalgia aside……for what it represented and that era, the song is fine by me.

Knicks are clowns@RexChapman @nyknicks I miss the 90s Knicks toughness. I’m still not over blowing Game 6 in the Finals that led to the atrocious 2-19 John Starks game 7. 😤😤@RexChapman @nyknicks 🙋🏽‍♀️🙋🏽‍♀️🙋🏽‍♀️long suffering Knicks fan here!@KhalWayne @nyknicks I hope you're right@NYKnicksPodcast @nyknicks Great idea...but do you have confidence Thibs would listen? Be honest@MelaineVCryBaby @nyknicks You're looking at it wrong. Randle production didn't just drop , it fell off a cliff. RJ would be better on s more athletic team. Look at Randle bringing the ball up, that's the reason our pace is so slow.@nyknicks My collection 💙🧡🇧🇷🇺🇲 https://t.co/MOC3njlDKt@h2sdrummer @hhpthebook @DamnImHungry23 @nyknicks yeah cause mitch broke his…sorry had to lmao@utahathletics @UtahMBB @NBA @nyknicks Great ceremony today.Like this tweet if you support every player on the New York Knicks.@hhpthebook @nyknicks Why would Sacramento want Randle......?@hhpthebook @nyknicks I was saying Leon Rose may force Thibs hand by making trades so he has to play younger guys, but yeah we’re definitely missing Derrick also!Champion. Trailblazer. Forever a part of @UtahMBB history. 

Watch the full Wat Misaka honored jersey ceremony. 

#GoUtes | @NBA | @nyknicks https://t.co/L0jr2bO7hy@nyknicks Put Grimes in the starting lineup, A better shooter and defender and have RJ coming with the 2nd unitGMviddy at it again! Pretty fair if you ask me. @nyknicks @DetroitPistons @Lakers #Knicks #Pistons #Lakers #NBA https://t.co/yC4iFBKq6g@hhpthebook @nyknicks Like your idea unfortunately Mark is blackballed because of past statements but Fox and Randle straight up right now Kings would want more like Grimes@hhpthebook @DamnImHungry23 @suburbsontilt @nyknicks And quicker (if that’s different?). There’s not a lot of foot speed in this team.Kids Heavyweight Satin Jacket - New York Knicks https://t.co/MpTOAW1Yar eBay https://t.co/HthdkuWysV@hhpthebook @nyknicks Jackson isn’t very good, he didn’t even think Draymond was a starter. I don’t think the Knicks needs to move in from Thibs but I’d love to see them add some specialists to the coaching staff. Someone who can write up out of bounds plays and some more offensive sets.@EricSaintCroix @hhpthebook @nyknicks Unfortunately this year he’s not the defensive genius either🤷🏻‍♂️@nyknicks Please Robinson put an arc on your foul shot.Reach for the top of the backboard to get the proper arc like you have when you are practicing shooting 3s@TheGreatDanes_ @nyknicks @KevKnox Lmao 2 1/2 years later.Come for the basketball, stay for @oh_malcolm's facial expressions when Dave and I talk about the New York Knicks https://t.co/Hqr8ujUtAZ@hhpthebook @nyknicks I second your plan.My collection @nyknicks

I have no idea what Sac wants.@MelaineVCryBaby @nyknicks 1. He's lost control of Randle. 8 days not speaking to the press.
2. Playing a struggling Randle too many minutes.
3. Mishandled the Kemba benching

Maybe Rose needs to force Thibs hand.@joeimparato0 @nyknicks Not quite yet, but it will be if they don't get their act together SOON!@KhalWayne @nyknicks I get it. I just think Thibs is ruining the kids at the expense of veterans.@JonnyGTree27 @nyknicks You might be right@hhpthebook @nyknicks Thibs deserves a chance to right the ship IMO. Aside from the fact that Mark Jackson would be a dumpster fire, Thibs is a proven coach and brought us to the playoffs already. I’m fine with the trade probably.@NBA_NewYork Knicks should trade for Grayson Allen?Dejounte Murray available this summer.

He has had small things here and there but really it’s just been the fractured hand (fluke) that kept him out and then this bigger injury.@hhpthebook @nyknicks I appreciate your view and loved Action Jackson as a hope, but it didn’t happen. Thibs is a Knick. He needs to stay. His mix didn’t work because of defensive inconsistency and Randle’s erradict play. He needs to commit to defense, rebounding and assists.@hhpthebook @nyknicks I wish you did work for Dolan. I love everything you just laid out. If you gave that squad major minutes together, they would be a problem.@hhpthebook @nyknicks Fans put way too much emphasis on coaching imo. Thibs is not perfect but no coach is. Priority #1 should always be getting the players first. Thibs deserves at least 3 seasons. If they’re still not playing well in year 3 than it’s justifiable to fire him@NBA_NewYork I hope Kemba never wears the Knicks shirt again@hhpthebook @suburbsontilt @nyknicks 1000%. Are we really going to repeat the team history of letting quality young players walk only to see them excel on another team? He’s been solid. Even if he gets 4/60 he’ll always be tradable because of what he brings.@hhpthebook @nyknicks I’m not sold Fox is the answer at PG, but clearly Obi and Mitch would benefit  from a lineup with a healthy consistent PG and a movement oriented offense. As for coaching, I don’t see MJ as the solution but I’m also not sure who is. Atkinson maybe?@sny_knicks @SNYtv Weak, this is NY, he wants to cash those checks? Then he has to face the music, very weak @nyknicks @J30_RANDLE@hhpthebook @nyknicks Mark Jackson is a fraud@RAMEL927 @DeepHoops @nyknicks @KnicksFanTv @TheKnicksWall @KnicksAnd_Dimes @hhpthebook @johnnyjohnjon83 The Kings@_dragondad @nyknicks Yup. In game is different from practice. Hard work at practice can still be fun. It’s how you build team unity. Fans don’t really have a sense of how an NBA team works, etc… because we’re so far removed.

Play him with burkes, obi (who never plays😡) IQ, and grimes. Move his 6’8” frame to a PF the with Obi at the 5 for a small ball squad@hhpthebook @nyknicks Mark is no better than Thibs. De’Aaron Fox is not that good to only be getting him in return. Do they both need to go? Yes, but I’d rather someone more proven than Mark Jackson or De’Aaron Fox lol@AndrewGreif @NBA_NewYork Hoping my Knicks can put together a complete game together and start to get their confidence back in line.@h2sdrummer @nyknicks Yeah, everything gets that magnifying glass treatment when we’re losing unfortunately. Would like to see them come in all business tomorrow though.@hhpthebook @nyknicks Speak your mind bro. #PushLetsGo@MichelobULTRA Gotta be my @nyknicks@RexChapman @nyknicks Yeah they didn’t win shit cause the Bulls took their hearts and then the Pacers did.   #overrated and #papertigers@_dragondad @nyknicks No doubt, didn’t mean my comment to seem angry. Seems like there’s a group of fans who don’t get that this is their career and laughing or smiling doesn’t mean they like losing.@hhpthebook @nyknicks Don’t agree on the coaching change but I’m with you 100% on the trade &amp; new lineup. 

Coaching is more than X’s &amp; O’s. Thibs isn’t the offensive genius we’d like but half of that is on the players. 

In 2 seasons he has a .534 win % without a legit starting PG…let that marinate.If the @nyknicks could have one guy besides the obvious ones it would be this guy. https://t.co/am2WJitiGw@hhpthebook @nyknicks Please god, no Mark Jackson!

If there's an alternative to Thibs I'd rather have Johnny Bryant than MJax. Problem with MJax is not his personal life, it's that he comes off as a hypocrit &amp; that loses a team quick@playoffpbball @nyknicks I hate back n forth on here. We had the much better bench. Our problem was coaching. Thibs didn't spend the time to prepare Quick and Obi, or run the offense through Barrett. We beat Philly,Atlanta and the Bucks last year.@_dragondad @nyknicks Because someone said something funny? Are@you angry at work all the time?Last year when i got my @nyknicks x @KITH crewneck the boys got RED HOT lets see if we can replicate it. https://t.co/X0L4izswvz@ngozulumatondo @RexChapman @nyknicks I didn’t say nobody could hit a jump shot I said every team had 1 starter who couldn’t. You joke about the scoring but games ended in the 60s and 70s all the time. Very unskilled era.@hhpthebook @nyknicks very true but for someone as big as Mitch he does get out rebounded by guys smaller than him…if he had noel’s athleticism and could stay healthy he would be borderline all star@SteveCordero @nyknicks See, I never really care about a person's personal life in sports. I could careless...thats as long as their not a rapist, murderer of abuser. I was never a NY post page 6 guy. But, if it worries you, bring in Rick Pitino. All his scandals are money related. 🤣@nyknicks Why are they smiling?@hhpthebook @nyknicks Did they not??? They spent 100 million on two free agent scorers. Deandre hunter was averaging 17 before he got hurt. John collins, clint capela &amp; Trae young. Why do you think they beat philly. They had way more talent then us. Thibs failed to adjust in the series though.@hhpthebook @nyknicks True. We can also hope that MJax isn't scandalous in his personal life while hiding behind religion &amp; also being a bigot@suburbsontilt @nyknicks You have to look at Mitch the right way. Mitch gets beat because he usually helping on defense and Randle doesn't cover his weak side. Watch the next game closely. Watch when Mitch goes to help and no one covers his vacated spot.@hhpthebook @nyknicks I concur with your assessment.@SteveCordero @nyknicks My hope is that Mark learned his lesson. We all can grow, I hope he has@hhpthebook @nyknicks haha just need him to stay healthy, a show a lil energy, and move quicker…but for a second round pick, he’s done better than most…just stop getting beat for rebounds by dudes smaller than you!!!@nyknicks @PelicansNBA Give the keys to BI and build around him, Knicks get to be "saved" by Zion and we're all happy@suburbsontilt @nyknicks Nooooo. I'm bias, but I love Money Mitch. He's a second round pick...what a steal and he's such a good kid.@hhpthebook @nyknicks Not in agreement on the coaching. Lineup wise that would be interesting.just gonna drop this here @nyknicks @PelicansNBA https://t.co/naLJZNJF3p@sitefeniseni3 @nyknicks I rather fox instead of hield@hhpthebook @nyknicks I love the direction lol but if we can get Simmons for Randle and picks I may do that too@hhpthebook @nyknicks I agree with you except for 1st sentence.

He can work on his attitude and his free throws@hhpthebook @nyknicks You should work for Dolan lmaoWhat I would do if I were the @nyknicks . I'd fire Thibs and Hire Mark Jackson.

The 80s and 90s were gloriously painful - I miss them every day.

But the Dolan/Thomas management curse of the 2000s has scarred my soul.@hhpthebook @nyknicks Tony - Thibs is the very best coach we have had in 21 years, legit two time coach of year, D always ranks high league wise.
