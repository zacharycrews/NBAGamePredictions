https://t.co/uFactHSNmB@DrCSTaylor @TorontoArgos @CFL @TorontoFC @Raptors I think it has to do with the sport as well. TFC’s star signings largely come from europe, while most basketball stars are from the USA.This probably confirms that #MLSE has punted any care for the @TorontoArgos. Dude yearly salary is 3x the entire @CFL team payroll.

Also, can make an argument that @TorontoFC has better pull of free agents than @Raptors. So it ain't got nothing to do with the city itself. https://t.co/0iOxTaPLswNBA Betting Preview: San Antonio Spurs vs. Toronto Raptors https://t.co/aXeRpujTgCSACRAMENTO KINGS +6.5

I think Lavine is ahead because of how well Bulls are doing. I also think Harden is there because Nets are holding up without Kyrie. Beal is avg career high 24ppg and Trae is avg 27ppg."George Hill trade Rumors.. Would look good in Toronto"

#FredVanVleet IS AN #NBAALLSTAR@statmuse @Raptors #FredVanVleet IS AN #NBAALLSTAR@DrEpid @Raptors Doctor, going by Ontario Health's numbers, gyms and restaurants are not a notable source of outbreaks or infections, so why are we throwing hundreds and thousands of people out of work when the main sources for infections are in schools and long-term homes?https://t.co/FTEpd4qVTP@MutantShibaClub Looks like a toronto Raptor claw 😇🤗🤣🤣  @CryptoZeus4  @isuyenc
🇨🇦🇨🇦🇨🇦🇨🇦🇨🇦The Toronto Raptors? 🤷🏾‍♀️@MrDanMacfarlane @nelcam @Raptors Wrong, I'm fully vaccinated and wear a mask where required. I just think it's ridiculous to wear one in an arena not surrounded by people. 🤷‍♂️Congratulations to MintedMoments (@mintedmoments) who moved up 78 spots to take #52 on the Toronto Raptors team leaderboard.

They are worth many many billions! TFC is small compared to NHL Maple Leafs, NBA Toronto Raptors etc. They have a very large bank account.

Low key, Raps much better than their record showing, only played a couple games with their main guys.  Nets don't want that 1st round matchup without Kyrie at all.@SteveNash the rookirs eafned playing tome with the toronto raptor and Orlando Magic game@TheGolferMatt @kliu82 @nelcam @JLew1050 @Raptors You just hit it into the deep rough my friend.

To better days ahead. 🍻@thepuckdude @Raptors I had higher hopes for 2022…until today!

https://t.co/b3pP5CChcOSix Toronto Raptors games get new dates as NBA reworks schedule https://t.co/XoUntnohQV@thepuckdude @Raptors You deserve some praise for lasting this long before reaching your breaking point.

I broke months ago...@timandfriends @FredVanVleet @tim_micallef @Raptors Ask tim is giannis still coming to toronto@Raptors Please allows fans!’@timandfriends @FredVanVleet @tim_micallef @Raptors His 1st time having 30 pts in back to back games#NBA (Temporada Regular) - Encerrados:

Toronto Raptors 120 x 105 New York Knicks 
Boston Celtics 116 x 111 Orlando Magic 
Cleveland Cavaliers 108 x 104 Indiana Pacers 
Sacramento Kings 115 x 113 Miami Heat 
Charlotte Hornets 99 x 133 Phoenix Suns@timandfriends @FredVanVleet @tim_micallef @Raptors Tim just wants to give everything to raptors or ex raptors@chicagobulls @DeMar_DeRozan IMO…Greatest Toronto Raptor of all time with his running mate Kyle Lowry.

#NBA #NBA75 #TorontoRaptorsFVV’s stats in his last 4 games:

31.0 POINTS
5.8 THREE POINTERS
8.8 ASSISTS
5.0 REBOUNDS
2.0 STEALS

@Raptors | #WeTheNorth https://t.co/HtC1YuS8pzAs a backup plan, I went ahead and booked us reservations to @realsports in Toronto so we could watch the game in the “Raptors restaurant” as my boys call it. Obviously not the same as being in the arena, but I was trying my best to salvage the trip and make it fun for them.This latest round of restrictions in Ontario officially has me at my breaking point.

For Christmas this year I bought my 7 y/o twin boys tickets to their first ever @Raptors game. We were gonna be seeing TOR/POR on January 23. Booked a hotel, booked train tickets…Date change by @NBA. Kyle Lowry's return to Toronto will be two days earlier - Feb. 1, not Feb. 3.The league adjusted the schedule for @MiamiHEAT vs @Raptors 
The question: will there be any spectators? https://t.co/knH2JwKS0R#Ontario is despicable hot garbage right now so that #Bulls game in February would be amazing.

IF fans are allowed in the building...because you know logic dictates #NBA games are not spreading the virus. So there's not a single number to justify banning fans. #Raptors #Toronto https://t.co/ZW5oGE0B0dPut some respect on @FredVanVleet's name

@tim_micallef explores how Freddy's doing things that have never been done in @Raptors franchise history, and things that are MVP calibre.

@FredVanVleet is an #NBAAllStar (You can RT this to vote for Freddy) https://t.co/FQItKlfdYx@OldManAndThree @jj_redick @talter @Raptors YESSS LESS GOO@ArmenBedakian I don't think they have that much attention beyond the GTA. Sure, Toronto medias talk a lot about them but I don't think they draw nationally the way the Raptors or Jays do... not even close.

They looked at the empty stands and knew something had to be done...Six Toronto Raptors games get new dates – ZellaNews https://t.co/zBIljq3pj6Six Toronto Raptors games get new dates as NBA reworks schedule https://t.co/KLzXXX3wgG
