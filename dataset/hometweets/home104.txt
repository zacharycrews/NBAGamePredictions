#JazzNation #UtahJazz #TakeNote https://t.co/60AD11Hbi1@JoeDGemma I think the Utah Jazz at least order fully painted courts to be used periodically—both "City Edition" courts have been used over multiple seasons, and the first court has now been repurposed as the Summer League court.Is Rudy Gobert playing at an MVP level? How does Rudy Gay fit in? And why the Utah Jazz are embracing the obvious.

The only starter from that team in 2017 that plays today is Rudy. Donovan was in college, Conley in Memphis, bojan on Nets, Royce O’Neale not on team. So if you think they’re #1 for any reason other than Rudy himself, u stupid@dish_answers @dish sure would be nice to watch the Utah Jazz tonight on root Sports.

Run it@IlliniDodgers @lost_ballparks Yeah. I never gave Lakers much thought until I got older and was like, but there are really no lakes in LA, lol. I think names should be left with the city. I mean, is there any worse combo/juxtaposition than Utah Jazz?@CollinCramer @Vegan_Vegeta I actually think that the series would pull quite a bit of national interest, given the history between the two teams ...

Something pretty rare for the Utah Jazz.@IKE_Bucks Bulls at 10 with a 5-1 record beating undefeated Utah jazz and coming back in the fourth to beat the Celtics. Yeah right.😂Here's how the Utah Jazz have fared in eFG% advantage every game this year!
