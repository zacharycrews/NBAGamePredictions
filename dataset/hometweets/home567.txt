Im never sure what GSW will do.@john12680 @MikeGrabman @Jumpshot8 @JohnEhrenfeld @NBA @Suns @warriors @Bulls @nets @Bucks @memgrizz I think they could get Kuminga + a 1st from GSW if they really tried, that's probably worth two Grizz 1sts.   Sabonis has quite a bit of value they're waiting for a bidding war@MikeGrabman @john12680 @Jumpshot8 @JohnEhrenfeld @NBA @Suns @warriors @Bulls @nets @Bucks @memgrizz Not sure who you're referring to here tbh but if you're talking about Ayton he'll drive you crazy, his motor has been one of the knocks against him ever since draft day, he floats around and looks like he's coasting quite a bit in most games@BillSimmons big @memgrizz fan here! Love the new pod, and here’s the optimal crunch time lineup for the Grizz: Ja/Bane/Brooks/BC/JJJ #GrindCity@Viscous_cree @MikeGrabman @Jumpshot8 @JohnEhrenfeld @NBA @Suns @warriors @Bulls @nets @Bucks @memgrizz totally agree thats why slomo on an expiring makes more sense. They want a rebuild. They wont get 2 first rounders from anyone else (OKC is not trading for Turner)@john12680 @MikeGrabman @Jumpshot8 @JohnEhrenfeld @NBA @Suns @warriors @Bulls @nets @Bucks @memgrizz They're pretty sick of having both Sabonis &amp; Myles on the same team iirc, they want only one of them to remain so one of them alone can play the 5.   Trading for Adams creates the same problem for them all over again@john12680 @MikeGrabman @Jumpshot8 @JohnEhrenfeld @NBA @Suns @warriors @Bulls @nets @Bucks @memgrizz I do think he can be had but it probably has to be an overpay i.e. KAT or something similar, he can't really go anywhere as a restricted free agent and only like 2 teams have any cap space so it's kind of a bad time for him in terms of leverage.  Sarver is super cheap though yeah@Viscous_cree @MikeGrabman @Jumpshot8 @JohnEhrenfeld @NBA @Suns @warriors @Bulls @nets @Bucks @memgrizz You dont think they would take Adams and 2 firsts (lakers and Jazz) for Turner? or maybe Slomo and 2 firsts? I think they would@MikeGrabman @john12680 @Jumpshot8 @JohnEhrenfeld @NBA @Suns @warriors @Bulls @nets @Bucks @memgrizz I remember browsing UNC fan reactions and they were ecstatic about Cam going to PHX which gave me hope, he hasn't disappointed in the slightest@Viscous_cree @MikeGrabman @Jumpshot8 @JohnEhrenfeld @NBA @Suns @warriors @Bulls @nets @Bucks @memgrizz yeah but 45-50 Million a year before the back half. Paul is expensive. Sarver is a cheap skate. You think Ayton is happy there after not getting extended? Maybe I am wrong. I think he can be had. But there is always someone  unhappy. Grizz have to trade but no FA is coming.@MikeGrabman @john12680 @Jumpshot8 @JohnEhrenfeld @NBA @Suns @warriors @Bulls @nets @Bucks @memgrizz Cam is almost definitely gone after his rookie deal sadly, even though he might be the best pure shooter on the team.   Ayton looking like the odd man out applies tenfold to Cam Johnson, unless you move on from one of the other starters or Cam agrees to take only $15M-$20M@NBA @JaMorant @memgrizz curry like a stack of ass ,lolMemphis Grizzlies celebrate National Mentoring Month with seven events throughout January | Memphis Grizzlies https://t.co/QKKbUD6LZL@john12680 @MikeGrabman @Jumpshot8 @JohnEhrenfeld @NBA @Suns @warriors @Bulls @nets @Bucks @memgrizz I've always liked Sabonis, but he's like an even higher usage version of Jonas so if you were happy downgrading to Adams as it were idk if it makes sense to revert back to Sabonis.   Adams -&gt; Turner would be the upgrade but you'd need a 3rd team because for Indiana that's lateral@john12680 @MikeGrabman @Jumpshot8 @JohnEhrenfeld @NBA @Suns @warriors @Bulls @nets @Bucks @memgrizz Paul's contract is basically non-guaranteed in the back half, Mikal was already signed for very very good value, Booker is Booker you have to pay him, Ayton will be paid depending on if anybody overpays in RFA via offer sheet.   Otherwise he probably doesn't get maxed imo@Viscous_cree @MikeGrabman @Jumpshot8 @JohnEhrenfeld @NBA @Suns @warriors @Bulls @nets @Bucks @memgrizz Sarver isn’t paying Paul booker bridges and ayton/Kat. I think ayton is odd man out. He can be had. But that would be a good trade for Minny. But there are other options for Memphis. Sabonis/turner. Siakim (wouldn’t be my pick). Zion (cough).@john12680 @MikeGrabman @Jumpshot8 @JohnEhrenfeld @NBA @Suns @warriors @Bulls @nets @Bucks @memgrizz Suns have wanted KAT forever, it's been rumored for years that they'd be willing to move Ayton for him.   Idk if moving him for Steven Adams and some mid-tier draft picks makes alot of sense

Celtics, who knows.   They could use the depth so a 4-for-1 or 5-for-1 would help them@MikeGrabman @john12680 @Jumpshot8 @JohnEhrenfeld @NBA @Suns @warriors @Bulls @nets @Bucks @memgrizz Oof yikes, didn't know that about JV's spouse@john12680 @MikeGrabman @Jumpshot8 @JohnEhrenfeld @NBA @Suns @warriors @Bulls @nets @Bucks @memgrizz That's fair, although giving up a 1st just to move off Adams' contract sounds painful

So you think no way Adams is around past next offseason?   He might have rehabilitated his value slightly in MEM but idk if it's by that much.   Most can't afford to start a non-offensive big@Viscous_cree @MikeGrabman @Jumpshot8 @JohnEhrenfeld @NBA @Suns @warriors @Bulls @nets @Bucks @memgrizz I’m quite enjoying the I think friendly discussion.@MikeGrabman @john12680 @Jumpshot8 @JohnEhrenfeld @NBA @Suns @warriors @Bulls @nets @Bucks @memgrizz Most of us can't really go outside rn so what else are we gonna do lol@2savagedsavage @JackmoveJohnny @memgrizz thanks！@Viscous_cree @MikeGrabman @Jumpshot8 @JohnEhrenfeld @NBA @Suns @warriors @Bulls @nets @Bucks @memgrizz Grizz can’t afford 25-27 for non rim protecting center (they have young guys to pay). Adams either plays next year or is dealt (his contract is very moveable especially with 3 firsts in next years draft). Plus a first round pick and a lottery pick in swaps.@TheNotoriousBJB @Titans @PredsNHL @memgrizz Knocking on the door of another in 2022!  @NashvilleSC https://t.co/HfEzq6UGQG@Viscous_cree @MikeGrabman @Jumpshot8 @JohnEhrenfeld @NBA @Suns @warriors @Bulls @nets @Bucks @memgrizz So mil, gsw, Phoenix, Utah, Chicago? Nets? Heat? Makes sense. Memphis probably right there at that 6-9 spot.@john12680 @MikeGrabman @Jumpshot8 @JohnEhrenfeld @NBA @Suns @warriors @Bulls @nets @Bucks @memgrizz Steven Adams is being paid $35M/2 to set screens and average 7/9/3 it's not like your saving THAT much money lol, he isn't going to get that much cheaper either.   I don't think Jonas gets maxed or anything like that he probably gets $25-27M per year and you're gonna re-up Adams@Viscous_cree @MikeGrabman @Jumpshot8 @JohnEhrenfeld @NBA @Suns @warriors @Bulls @nets @Bucks @memgrizz Very good point. Okc game in particular messed the numbers up. But they also looked stout against Phoenix and the nets on the road. Underrated win against the cavs on the second night of a road back to back short handed.@MikeGrabman @john12680 @Jumpshot8 @JohnEhrenfeld @NBA @Suns @warriors @Bulls @nets @Bucks @memgrizz Top 8?   Yeah sure

Top 5?   No@john12680 @MikeGrabman @Jumpshot8 @JohnEhrenfeld @NBA @Suns @warriors @Bulls @nets @Bucks @memgrizz Over half of your games in the last 20 contests have been against bottom 15 offenses so I'd hope so.   SAC, HOU, OKC, DAL, LAL and almost all of them you've played 2-3x@Viscous_cree @MikeGrabman @Jumpshot8 @JohnEhrenfeld @NBA @Suns @warriors @Bulls @nets @Bucks @memgrizz Good for Jonas putting up big numbers. I’m sure the grizz are even happier when some team way overpays or the pelicans keep him. Meanwhile the grizz are rebounding better than ever and Ja is ascending. Also they will flip that first (Myles turner, cam reddish) the trade isn’t a l@Viscous_cree @MikeGrabman @Jumpshot8 @JohnEhrenfeld @NBA @Suns @warriors @Bulls @nets @Bucks @memgrizz Add in the contracts and the fact that the grizz wouldn’t have been able to resign Jonas ( by the way huge favorite in Memphis) and the addition of picking up Z. Williams and the Lakers first make this trade look much better.@Viscous_cree @MikeGrabman @Jumpshot8 @JohnEhrenfeld @NBA @Suns @warriors @Bulls @nets @Bucks @memgrizz I could care less where you rank the grizz. I was just saying the narrative around the Jonas - Adams trade is lazy. The grizz sucked on defense the first 15 games then got better (much better). Adams has played really well while having lower usage which is also a plus.@JohnEhrenfeld @Bulls @Bucks @memgrizz How the logic Doncic was best player on floor.@MikeGrabman @john12680 @Jumpshot8 @JohnEhrenfeld @NBA @Suns @warriors @Bulls @nets @Bucks @memgrizz Alright dude cool@MikeGrabman @john12680 @Jumpshot8 @JohnEhrenfeld @NBA @Suns @warriors @Bulls @nets @Bucks @memgrizz Bro y'all are the original ones who got upset 😂😂😂😂
