Same situation as Wiggins currently.@yehhh_xd @RealisticSuns @warriors yeah but with all the great guard play in the west its more likely the wild card spots will go to guardsGreatness.

@Oracle || Game Ready https://t.co/s0ULhuXxZw@larrythelefty @kevin_v845 @warriors Paul George. And dont bring up injuries cause what is KD. Injured.@JonTheBomb3363 @RevengeSZN_ @DLoForThree @GiantsPlzWin @NBAAllStar @warriors @22wiggins They are not so far apart. So you’re argument of “they play no defense” is dumb@warriors the lakers are trying to use golden state colors   so whats new  anyteam that is better than they are they use their colors.@LEDBreezey @DLoForThree @GiantsPlzWin @NBAAllStar @warriors @22wiggins He got that I’m pretty sure bc of him injuring Kawhi@warriors @StephenCurry30 Another 6/19 night@CarolCann22 @kdb_hoops @warriors Man , stop . He’s shooting like 32% from 3 in the last 2 months .@warriors An average year you mean.@ARENA_hf @RealisticSuns @warriors He did get enough media/player votes to get him in the top 3 tho no? That’s my point. He got enough votes that he needed. If someone gets the starter spot without a single media/player vote, then they need to change the system. Until that happens, it’s fineWe’ve got Ube Crinkle Cookie dipped in white chocolate with @warriors sprinkles at every City Bistro eatery tonight 😋 https://t.co/AbaX9jv6c0@DevinHendrick12 @bryceth75148291 @NBATV @22wiggins @warriors What makes you think warriors are 2nd seed?@warriors I wouldve at least been better off if it were Draymond, but wiggins... 🤮🤮🤮@warriors @22wiggins Next...find the best barber in San Francisco✂️✂️✂️@jhannes14 @yeezysosa @ClutchPointsApp @NBAMemes @warriors But yeah I low key am mad lmao 😂@GodlLotus @warriors @22wiggins Just saying in general. Ur making it seem like a bad this that fans are biased. Every teams fans are biased. Thats really with anything@jhannes14 @yeezysosa @ClutchPointsApp @NBAMemes @warriors Honestly didn’t want to use a Timberwolf here, but I mean stats don’t lie. KAT is beating him on every front. You ask anyone to name the best forwards in the game and nobody would say Wigs. Ask about big men and you know KAT’s name comes up. https://t.co/tzaahpI6Y9@emosto3 @YTJosiahGaming @8463u @warriors @22wiggins DEVIN BOOKER IS NOT A FORWARD HES A SHOOTING GUARDDDDDDDDD@BurnerClarkson @CurryPlsRetire @warriors @StephenCurry30 And what happend in that playoffs?

I want the old curry back ffs.Psyched for the @warriors game tonight at 10pm 🏀🙌🏽‼️ gonna be a great game@warriors @22wiggins YESSIR IGGINS 🔥🔥🔥@OzHouston @warriors As a Raptors fan, a ton of my votes are for Raptors players. Its not because I bandwagon, its because I want to see my favorite players in the all-star game. And if the Raptors are winning, I’m more likely to vote. I’m sure Warriors fans do the same.@warriors @StephenCurry30 What is great look! Cream, brown, smokey coffee and a touch of black! Pale pink drink bottle!

I just look at the numbers.@warriors @22wiggins Congrats Wiggs! 🥳🎉@JaysonAZ602 @_b0y1da_ @warriors He did get enough media/player votes to get him in the top 3 tho no? That’s my point.

Get educated yourself kid and stop looking just at stats@NikRiehle @warriors @22wiggins A movie 🎥@Tylerferg_12 @NBAAllStar @warriors @22wiggins Every year we have bitches like you complaining when this type of voting is the same across NFL, MLB, NHL. It an opportunity for fans to show how much they appreciate that player even tho the selections aren’t 100% based on fan votes. You want your guy in, vote more 🤫@warriors @22wiggins First the work now the rewards. Congrats Andrew.

Haven't heard?@yehhh_xd @RealisticSuns @warriors im saying the amount of votes he got from the players and media was less than draymond and rudy, look it up. 2/3 groups of voters thought they deserved it over wiggins - it was the fans that got him there@JorFailure_ @warriors @22wiggins Ratio deserved@NBAonTNT @22wiggins @warriors He’s an all star sure, but he’ll nah he isn’t starting for my@team@NBAonTNT @22wiggins @warriors Boom.

You should be more frustrated your team traded away yet another All Star.@warriors @StephenCurry30 Umm Wiggins@warriors my captain anyways🤷🏻‍♀️@warriors he is there now what a accomplished@ReeseSutherlan4 @larrythelefty @kevin_v845 @warriors He was listed as a backcourt player so not relevant to the debate@NBAonTNT @22wiggins @warriors WTF 😂😂😂😂 NAH@kadenking51 @RealisticSuns @warriors He does tho, that’s why he got in 🤷🏽‍♂️. I think any of draymond/Gobert/Kat could have got the spot, they all deserve it. Some more than others? Sure, but this is how the cookie crumbled. It ain’t a big deal at the end of the day who starts and who comes off the bench doesn’t matter@warriors It’s now a super team now@DubsRedeemed @KeginoKegino @TheSweetLife22 @warriors @22wiggins Bro how mad are you.

Plus, the Warriors have a very large fan base, so that was gonna help him get a bunch of votes.@yehhh_xd @ARENA_hf @warriors The point isn’t that they didn’t vote him to be an all star, they didn’t vote him to be a starter. Only fan voting did that and I’m literally out here arguing for another player on your team to make it over him 🤣@Jeff95993574 @warriors better than tatum sadly@bronbetta23 @warriors - LeCarried fan@Luka77SZN @warriors Ok casual warrior fan😂😂@RealisticSuns @warriors I agree, I think draymond deserves it more than Wiggins too, but that doesn’t mean Wiggins doesn’t deserve as well. I wouldn’t be mad if Kat or gobert got the spot we well. They all deserved it 🤷🏽‍♂️@Wilt_BurnerAcc @warriors wiggins &gt; wilt@T_x_Wolves @yeezysosa @ClutchPointsApp @NBAMemes @warriors Book is a guard and wiggs is a forward@aaron_foresman @Sir_Lexy99 @NBAonTNT @22wiggins @warriors They have a winning record(slightly over .500 I know) and that has nothing to do with an all star starter selection. Your stats do though, which KAT is way higher in every major one. And it's backcourt and frontcourt selections?@NBAonTNT @22wiggins @warriors Rigged bs , Andrew Trashgins , where’s dbook starter # 1 seed in the west u bums, book is so good this season and y’all biased bums@NBAonTNT @22wiggins @warriors I'm happy for Wiggins. I've always appreciated his talent. But no way did I think he would be a starter in the All Star Game this year. This is the biggest surprise of the NBA season #NBAAllStar #NBA75@Dami0nLee @warriors Warriors is now a super teamCrazy to think the day Andrew Wiggins got announced to be a NBA All Star Starter is the day the Golden State Warriors gonna play against the Minnesota Timberwolves aka his former team.@PrevDaCat @Luis52273497 @warriors Also what do you think the average age of NBA Twitter is?

My point was that 1 group of fans voting for a player doesn’t get them into the asg. they need players/media votes to get in too, which Wiggins got?@NickMoonEmoji @DLoForThree @GiantsPlzWin @NBAAllStar @warriors @22wiggins Yeah I was big on dlo loved what he did in BK he wasn’t bad just had a small sample size and when Steph got hurt he couldn’t pick up the slack so that’s what my opinion is on@warriors WIGGINS OVER DEVIN BOOKER IS BLASPHEMY AND HIGHLY DISRESPECTFUL@BScalesOfficial @NBAAllStar @warriors @22wiggins Not the point bozo@NBATV @22wiggins @warriors Joke“I want to congratulate him and his family” – Shaquille O’Neal congratulates Andrew Wiggins on making the All-Star starting lineup, says the Golden State Warriors have turned him into a winner https://t.co/4cI7Rnrxw3@mememike2 @kevin_v845 @warriors players also had draymond and ayton over kat@alexkuelbs1 @KeginoKegino @TheSweetLife22 @warriors @22wiggins Up your ass lmaooo you walked right into that one 😂😂🤣🤣@TJaymz11 @Sir_Lexy99 @NBAonTNT @22wiggins @warriors In the NBA I watch KAT is game from being a loser and plays the 5.@T_x_Wolves @yeezysosa @ClutchPointsApp @NBAMemes @warriors In this world@DamonBruce @957thegame @AndrewSiciliano @warriors @anthonyVslater I turned down sex to listen to Damon @LeBatardShow and @RattoIndy segment yesterday. 100% correct decision.@warriors @StephenCurry30 My guy haas shit in his ass@Tom25541217 @StephenWessels_ @NBAonTNT @22wiggins @warriors Thats not true for the starters actually.

So it got to be wiggs and that’s how he got it.Can't wait to hear this at the ASG.

Making his All-Star debut, serving up highlight reels the likes of which are unreal. From the Golden State Warriors...

Kept us in a lot of games.@NBATV @22wiggins @warriors All the people who're saying Wiggins doesn't deserve an all star spot will be the same people discrediting Curry for playing next to an all star.

If they are better then they are better. Glad be made it as a starter cause he wouldn’t have made it at a reserve lol.@_iamronansantos @NBAonTNT @22wiggins @warriors If I looked like u, maybe.@osusportsfan68 @NBAAllStar @warriors @22wiggins show shooting stats.

He's the defensive anchor on THE best team in the league. Averaging a double double, a better defender, and still the 3rd best player on his team.@jebronsburner @NBAAllStar @warriors @22wiggins did you post this graphic to show that Bojan is supposed to get that spot? casue all the numbers favor Wiggins lol. not to mention he is an elite defender. yeah elite. he not gonna get national recognition, but he can clamp@warriors What a joke@trripppie @Quintssential @NBAonTNT @StephenCurry30 @warriors Boys saved youI gotta give it up 1x for @warriors fans.

He just isn’t deserving is why people are mad. Happy for him tho@NBATV @22wiggins @warriors Congratulations. Huge achievement. But, come on.

Maybe he’s legitimately having an impact on the Warriors but all his efforts may not appear on the stat sheet? 🤷🏾‍♂️@NBAonTNT @22wiggins @warriors So many people thought his career was a bust, he really reinvented himself at #DubNation@warriors Curry robbed from captain@jamellszn @warriors @StephenCurry30 still shooting til he drop@OzHouston @warriors Not an All Star starter but has a case to be an All star since the small forward position in the West is wide open.@_LifeOfTy_ @NBAonTNT @22wiggins @warriors I think it’s just that their are more elite guards than forwards, and the forwards are injured.

He entered the league at 21 and didn't really break through because of injuries until his fourth season.
He also missed an entire year in 2020 because of that wrist fracture.
Not many playes have that much, that's almost a decade of All-Star basketball.@415_mattt @MajinHashira @KneeTis @wushock38 @NBAAllStar @warriors @22wiggins I mean, if you can make an argument for Wiggins u could make one for idk guys like JJJ, who’s averaging 17, 7, anx 2.5 blocks and is top 5 in DPOY.

The deal is a first-of-its-kind with an active player 📺 https://t.co/BDZHad7WJe@MarcJSpears Thank you @Warriors🏀 The Golden State Warriors will look to build on an impressive win last time out when they welcome the Minnesota Timberwolves later today

Yedlin, Dest, Cannon...all RB.

That isn't to justify his inclusion as much as to point out that people have ridiculous reasons, at times that are not true, why a player shouldn't be on the team except for 3 letters: MLS.@seanthejawn1 @MSSBart @MiamiSports87 @USMNT @warriors @usabasketball @SteveKerr @VW Criticism is part of the job. GGG has brought the biggest youth movement and convinced some amazing talent to work with the US. When I see multiple post with likes about wanting to lose, and possibly risk qualification, to fire GGG it is weird to me@seanthejawn1 @MSSBart @MiamiSports87 @USMNT @warriors @usabasketball @SteveKerr @VW Is incredible. I'm not always a fan of selection and I'm sure every roster from any coach will have some grievances, I tend to look at: After not qualifying, we need to qualify. We are going to qualify with our youngest most inexperienced team@seanthejawn1 @MSSBart @MiamiSports87 @USMNT @warriors @usabasketball @SteveKerr @VW The fake outrage over role players is laughable to me. I want all of our players in Europe, but that is not realistic to make up a team for 2022 WC with a good balance and fit. 2026 will be much different. The amount of fans that "know" exactly why a guy wasn't called (MLS quota)@seanthejawn1 @MSSBart @MiamiSports87 @USMNT @warriors @usabasketball @SteveKerr @VW That is what I'm talking about. Say you don't like MLS n don't value it. We will need MLS depth. Not good? You know Roldan is typically among the Opta best XI, and has 70 total WCQ minutes.

It’s a joke.@SephHoff @MSSBart @MiamiSports87 @USMNT @warriors @usabasketball @SteveKerr @VW It shows that Gregg just doesn’t know what he’s doing with this team. How do you call up lennon over scally. This isn’t a eurosnob comment. It’s a fact that scally is miles better. Gregg keeps limiting this team with the Ariolas and the Zardes. What does…@SephHoff @MSSBart @MiamiSports87 @USMNT @warriors @usabasketball @SteveKerr @VW Players like Lleget and Roldán get called up repeaditly. There’s a reason they’ve never played in Europe. It’s call they aren’t good. Acosta might be the only veteran MLSer I would take on my team. The fact that Scally got left off the roster is a joke…@SephHoff @MSSBart @MiamiSports87 @USMNT @warriors @usabasketball @SteveKerr @VW the difference between euro and MLS players is simple.

Would you encourage @warriors to sign Willie Cauley-Stein? He is available.

My thoughts: His youth &amp; past experience w/ #DubNation a big plus. I think he is a sweet person. Would love to add this big man who is a known quantity!

@THEwillieCS15@danielhoo21 @warriors @JonathanKuming6 Hello, nice to meet you, your favorite star@Jayeeik_ @WandomWude476 @HoodieRamsey @NFL Just to be clear, the @warriors were never a super team right?@hayescarroll_ @warriors @Suns Lol….not one single team is scared of the lakers. Go back to bed.@p_lo @warriors @Timberwolves Send some tix 👀Steve Nash says the Nets are hopeful James Harden (left hamstring tightness) is available for Saturday's matchup against the Golden State Warriors. I asked Nash if it was safe to assume Harden is available and his answer wasn't 'yes,' so something to monitor.@warriors @Lakers Get away BamBam@ZNENDrii @T17Zay @1dollarhaircuts @warriors @JonathanKuming6 Yup.

Did I call you that? 

I agree that the majority of starters should and will come from Europe. I was stating what I have seen in the comments section. And that the majority of gripes (that I have seen) are on players that haven't played much WCQmin
