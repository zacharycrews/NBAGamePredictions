💵 $17.50 -&gt; $24.79@The_Time_Lord @space_diff @celtics The swelling from a bone bruise occurs from the initial contusion that causes it. It doesn’t just go away and come back again. I’d put a lot of money on it being meniscus related.Man if you’re a @celtics fan or just a basketball fan you have to be following @chibbs_1

Worse case scenario? Minimal swelling &amp; soreness. Use of cold pack helpful.@MrCrikey @PritchBurner @celtics He did. Rob had a lateral meniscus tear, where tissue is basically shaved off to prevent tissue from interfering in knee joint movement. The medial meniscus tear is the worse injury usually requiring stitching of the tear to prevent interference in motion.This @celtics - @MiamiHEAT conference final is the ultimate wasted Process potential testimony for the @sixers : the two worst moves of the Process producing two high level contenders.

I am thinking the newly french traitor @JoelEmbiid will be tearing up while watching from his living room. I can't believe he will waste all his talent in a ringless sting at the NBA.Just learned on Showtime's "All The Smoke" that when Julian Edelman was suspended in 2017 for 4 weeks, he spent that time rehabbing in the Boston Celtics facility. Spent quality time with Marcus Smart, Al Horford, Jayson Tatum, Jaylen Brown &amp; Kyrie. Dope. https://t.co/nNf3qGitJi@TheMiamiHeatUK @celtics I think ppl are underestimating the Heat.
