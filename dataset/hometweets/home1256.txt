#BelieveAtlanta #ForTheA #BeatMiami @BravesOnBally @HawksOnBally https://t.co/5jFGysEIPY https://t.co/czU1pDmQWmI don’t see the Atlanta Hawks losing three games in a row, especially at home 🏡

Atlanta has won 20 of their last 23 games at State Farm Arena, and I expect Trae Young to clean up his TOs (10 last game) and score 35+ w/ 10+ dimes tonight.
