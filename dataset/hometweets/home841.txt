Idk if you think I‚Äôm hating the wizards or something but wtverOne last note on future Celtics picks:

Boston owed a 2023 2nd to Charlotte from the Gordon Hayward S&amp;T. The Hornets put protections on that pick in a trade with the Wizards.

Boston still gives up the pick, but it's now:
31-45 to Charlotte
46-60 to WashingtonSacramento's roster got quite the face-lift during the trade deadline.
