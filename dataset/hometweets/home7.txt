#GamblingTwitter@gazergazerfatzz @hvocrweare @GOATEMBIID1 @therlbread_zo @TheNBACentral @KevinOConnorNBA @RealDealBeal23 I could have decided to follow the Minnesota Timberwolves and y'all still didn't win anything last year. My point remains. What's the reward for being the 1st seed if you can't get a ring or let alone win your conference? Nothing. That's all.@BallySportsDET Why am I getting the Minnesota Timberwolves pregame show on the Bally Sports app on Roku instead of the DETROIT PISTONS??  I am in Michigan, not Minnesota.  You know, MI not MN.  Get your act together, the game starts in 20 minutes.2021-22 Minnesota Timberwolves prediction: 43-39Minnesota Timberwolves (34.5). Under. I think we're still a year removed from the TWolves youth leap, but they'll be a lot more competent.  I just think they're at the phase where blowout losses turn into competitive losses and not wins yet.@Bob88048593 @Misfraud @ScottMGreer Minnesota Timberwolves I believe#PontoPlacard #NBA
