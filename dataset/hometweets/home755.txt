Now that‚Äôs a good place to read a book!@FanDuel New York Knicks@queens_dude @jfromflorida1 @nyknicks Well I mean @ that time.. not necessarily now.. in hindsight NOLA shoulda took Ja..but @ that time the NBA was going to lose a star in a small market so let‚Äôs say NOLA woulda been 8th or so that team woulda been done and Memphis had been trending down, they had to get stars there@johnnyjohnjon83 @jfromflorida1 @nyknicks Zion isn‚Äôt helping Nola now‚Ä¶he doesn‚Äôt want to be there@knicks81 @nyknicks YES and I will pack their bags too.@sitefs4 @nyknicks But with those older guys we could go and chase a true point guard@ascrolove @hhpthebook @nyknicks Depends on the cost.. Having 9 young players with potential is great but they all can't play 30+minutes per game and there is no guarantee they all develop. So yes consoldating a few of them for a star like KD is something you have to consider doing.@nyknicks Everyone grab your tickets for the depressed knicks space üòì@sitefs4 @nyknicks Idk man Mitch should stay and we should pay him somewhere between 10-15 million a year, trade kemba fournier Noel for younger guys,

It's been 50 years &amp; we still coming@Shortz2186 @nyknicks Need help getting talent though@jfromflorida1 @nyknicks Knicks don't need help getting that üí∞ !@johnnyjohnjon83 @nyknicks Facts smh@SportsToonsPlus @hhpthebook @nyknicks I like Evan and Kemba a lot but I think they don‚Äôt fit. We got rid of Reggie who had good chemistry with the team and to me it was a mistake.@nyjetsgirl25 @hhpthebook @nyknicks Maybe Evan was a lil' overpaid and shouldn't necessarily start, BUT he can shoot and is a good, useful player when he's aggressive. Sometimes it takes a minute to get accustomed to NY whether you're a vet or not.Check out this listing I just added to my #Poshmark closet: New York Knicks basketball hoodie. https://t.co/ppEpJjQA4h #shopmycloset @poshmarkapp@hhpthebook @nyknicks You had me until u said make rose the captain lol@SwordsLiquidity @hhpthebook @nyknicks And the fact that they didn‚Äôt go for him because he wanted 4 years tells you everything. They added guys to help win while still being able to jump ship if things didn‚Äôt work out. They traded for cam, not a vet. That says a lot too. FO and coach are aware of what they are doing.@hhpthebook @nyknicks Leon had nothing to do with RJ and Mitch@jfromflorida1 @nyknicks Yea the fuck us over every year with the lottery how teams with better records get top picks lol.#ad Blood in the Garden: The Flagrant History of the 1990s New York Knicks Hardcover for $19.57!

https://t.co/XW8VmmIuKL https://t.co/FkINuoGZwa@sancocho_papi @nyknicks @KnicksMSGN at what point do you play Thibs instead of the players?Since @NBA League Pass is at a low price we chose to upgrade it now we have all the teams not just the @nyknicks I‚Äôm so excited I can watch games when there isn‚Äôt any on cable.@BlessedAdam_ @michaelkasdan @hhpthebook @nyknicks Exactly the only other player to come in and dominate was bron 30 years ago lol.@MikeC1128 @hhpthebook @nyknicks Great point. It seems expectations are high because last year we overachieved . Last year we were the youngest team (prior to Rose and taj acquisitions) and had the lowest payroll in the league. I just wish we signed Derozan instead of this bargain bin Garbage.@hhpthebook @nyknicks The problem is Thibs #knicks@hhpthebook @CatRP @nyknicks It‚Äôs just that classic situation.. they gave Fournier a 40 million dollar contract?.. well.. that doesn‚Äôt look too good if your Dolan.. might as well try to keep the rookies a secret. It looks terrible if you start a rookie over a big contract and high expectations..@hhpthebook @nyknicks Thibs might be forced to play overpriced garbage over the rookies to increase trade value or to save his job in the event of him getting the blame. This Knicks team is a 1st round KO regardless.. Thibs is playing the off$eason signings to show loyalty t Rose‚Äôs decision making@Barbershopspor2 @nyknicks Loading.... https://t.co/oWKaolisC9I swear if I see the Bengals win a Super Bowl before I see the @nyknicks win an NBA title in my lifetime, imma flip out üò°New York Knicks, Chase Gift Bronx-Based Charter School With $100K: The New York Knicks and Chase gifted a Bronx-based charter school with $100K. https://t.co/UjwbByt2n5 https://t.co/4WOdUSJ0HU@cjsarinas16 New York Knicks (their first title)New York Knicks, Chase Gift Bronx-Based Charter School With $100K https://t.co/feW7EgVqN3@hhpthebook @nyknicks Guess you'd be happy with a 50 loss season.

STILL can‚Äôt shoot, He‚Äôs absolutely dreadful off ball, he‚Äôs not a good defender &amp; he‚Äôs overpaid, And we aren‚Äôt better with or without him. So Nah, we‚Äôre good.@Knicksallday69 But he is not, and it looks like he is not mentally strong, and checked out, is there a chance for the lottery? @nyknicks #KnicksTape @NBA@AbsCoverage I hope for a Patrick Ewing @nyknicks type of scamThe @NYRangers are second in their division and 4th in the conference. Can't say the same for you @nyknicks@hhpthebook @nyknicks Couldn‚Äôt agree more‚Ä¶and just like Randle may be a bridge guy who no longer can/or chooses fit the build, Thibs may be the same. didn‚Äôt think it would be this quick, but these guys are going to need a teacher, a unifier, a leader who can develop a team from the ground up!New York Knicks: Knicks-Kings could be showcase for potential trade https://t.co/IOrDDPooYc@PhinsChris @Kold91 For what it's worth, this thing is full of misery for any New York fan. The Jets were awful, the Knicks were awful, the Mets and Yankees were full of unfounded optimism that crumbled soon after. Good times, my friend. Good times.@hhpthebook @nyknicks How about don‚Äôt blame anybody? It‚Äôs called growing pains. They‚Äôre a rebuilding team also trying to make the playoffs. Those two things are not conducive to winning. Let the FO and coach work there way through it. The sky is not falling and no thibs does not hate obi. Good grief@Not47Buddz @DonBolo79 @hhpthebook @nyknicks He also drafted Obi over Haliburton when Knicks desperately needed a PG.  We could do much better in front office than Rose and Perry.@Not47Buddz @DonBolo79 @hhpthebook @nyknicks Scott Perry sucks.  Should have been fired with Steve Mills.  He drafted Knox over Alexander (PG).  He extended Randle.  He had the most cap space in NBA this offseason and look what he did with it.  Signed Fournier, Kemba, Noel and Burks and extended Randle.@jfromflorida1 @nyknicks We should have taken Donovan and Bridges instead of Frank and Knox. That‚Äôs not Silver@KnicksCentral What the hell makes u think the Celtics are trading Tatum for taj Gibson , D rose  and Bum ass Noel?I‚Äôm lost?
And I‚Äôm a @nyknicks fanThis is coaching malpractice. The @nyknicks are 4 games below 500 and last in the East, and yet Thibs can't find room in the rotation for Cam Reddish? Has he not figured out yet that his current rotation is NOT working? https://t.co/oBDe4Bf2g3@johnnyjohnjon83 @nyknicks No excuse dave stern saw the bigger picture with Chicago la nyc driving the league and the other teams following .. shoulda never put a franchise in Memphis and new orlenas@Not47Buddz @hhpthebook @nyknicks Ur argument doesnt clarify anything beyond blaming Mills for everything.

They aren't real receipts if ur asking me who the Pobo is.

A receipt is u showing me an article that said it was Solely Mills doing this or that.  All. speculative. U back to square 1@jfromflorida1 @nyknicks I hate stern he did get us ewing tho silver worseAy @drose nickname should be "The Captain" because the way he lead the @nyknicks is crazy. üî•üëÄ These guys look up to him fr. The heart of the team. #NewYorkForever https://t.co/ahQSqGM2C5@hhpthebook @nyknicks He‚Äôs not signing players that builds on last years success. Now the season is in deep trouble.. It was a mistake. He can do a lot of good things and make mistakes too.@tommy_sage @nyknicks Silver is corny mr anothe stern
