#Knicks | #Lakers | @bgarciaivsports  https://t.co/8mGmOfeuCP@nyknicks the Knicks starting five next season.  Brunson, grimes, Barrett, Robinson, and no other then Zion Williamson.  I would completely forget this season and Julius Randle if this were to happen.  Anybody else?@nyknicks i truly believe the Knicks are preparing for a Zion Williamson deal after the season.  Honestly, i fell Zion is done in New Orleans anyway and he’s milking this BS over his weight because he wants out.  He will be back to form and on the Knicks next season.  Anybody ??A team built around 25 year old R.J. Barrett will dominate the league for AT LEAST 5 years....

Now that’s a good place to read a book!@FanDuel New York Knicks@queens_dude @jfromflorida1 @nyknicks Well I mean @ that time.. not necessarily now.. in hindsight NOLA shoulda took Ja..but @ that time the NBA was going to lose a star in a small market so let’s say NOLA woulda been 8th or so that team woulda been done and Memphis had been trending down, they had to get stars there@johnnyjohnjon83 @jfromflorida1 @nyknicks Zion isn’t helping Nola now…he doesn’t want to be there@knicks81 @nyknicks YES and I will pack their bags too.@sitefs4 @nyknicks But with those older guys we could go and chase a true point guard@ascrolove @hhpthebook @nyknicks Depends on the cost.. Having 9 young players with potential is great but they all can't play 30+minutes per game and there is no guarantee they all develop. So yes consoldating a few of them for a star like KD is something you have to consider doing.@nyknicks Everyone grab your tickets for the depressed knicks space 😓@sitefs4 @nyknicks Idk man Mitch should stay and we should pay him somewhere between 10-15 million a year, trade kemba fournier Noel for younger guys,

https://t.co/wXopKGp9py@queens_dude @jfromflorida1 @nyknicks Bad for us but to Silver good for NOLA and Memphis@knicks81 @nyknicks Yes. You get a PG who can defend and push the pace. Bagley is expiring. Move off Kemba and Randle. Pick is protected.Today's NBA Consensus (So Far):

Oh, and that team snapped their 12-game road losing streak... at Madison Square Garden against the New York Knicks.@EUGENECSH @hhpthebook @nyknicks The trolls have arrived. If you seriously think Fourniers contract is unburdensome you are living on another planet. Kemba is broken down and can't play D against PG's. He's basically unplayable in a playoff series. You can ask the Celtics about that@IVTheKnicksFan "The New York Knicks play basketball today. Rejoice (or drink) accordingly" .... pass me the bottle!@jfromflorida1 @johnnyjohnjon83 @nyknicks Big facts!!!!   Silver let the NBA down—even the Knicks hating media—by gifting Zion to New Orleans instead of NYC.  I said it then that it was bad business@CAPTAINPEARLNYK @Herring_NBA @nyknicks brilliant! i changed my porzingis jersey to say "Not Porzingis" but this is way more creative.@hhpthebook @MzSweetFeet @nyknicks I love that post. High 5 to Leon Rose. But according to the history of the Knicks, They would tear that whole pic down for one used up super star player. Would you tear it down for KD? ….I wouldn’t…..But I’m sure Dolan would. He’d over step Leon 4 KD.@hhpthebook @nyknicks it's been the coach. all the way. had the power to turn it around multiple times, lots of opportunities, but just stuck to the same ol, same ol = very measly plan of giving julius the ball. he's been a negative for the team this seasonNEW 🏀NBA betting picks:

But considering their relationship and Thibs’ NY ties we knew he was gonna be the guy. No one knows Thibs better than Leon. He knew what he was getting. I still think it was the right hire. But gotta see what the roster looks like after the deadline.@nyknicks 3 of 3 Julius comes out of the game at 4 minute mark. Helps him keep fresh and gives Obi more minutes. Julius hasn’t said no to playing more but doesn’t mean his body has said yes.@AaliyahNevaeh7 Hope they play hard, smart, and compete. Wishful thinking 😒 @nyknicks @NBA_NewYork @NBA@nyknicks 2 of 3 Rose comes back, you alternate him and Kemba in the starting rotation. Helps them both w/load mgmt. Also adds wrinkles for opponents preparation.@nyknicks 1 of 3 Minor changes I would make today. Put quick in the starting lineup until Rose comes back. Bring Kemba off the bench until then. Then you see what the group looks like with Quick.@hhpthebook @nyknicks Can't forget Rokas Jokubaitis.January 31, 1990: New York's Gerald Wilkins with a pair of "one-hand, flying dunks" in Boston Garden.

I think Burks could be traded. Perhaps a salary dump kind of trade to the Kings for Tristan Thompson's expiring deal?The New York Knicks play basketball today. Rejoice (or drink) accordingly 🙌🏾@MzSweetFeet @hhpthebook @nyknicks I think overall I could get behind this. Obi still is the tough pill. And Burkes needs to go back to bench SG.

He's not a great 3pt shooter but has a nice looking shot.. he hits enough that they have to respect him and keep a defender close.

The players in the rotation is not winning games so how you don’t change that @nyknicks@MzSweetFeet @hhpthebook @nyknicks I know we have guys whose 3pt #s are decent but the eyeball test doesn’t justify.

He can shoot 3’s so if he plays C will help stretch the floor@MzSweetFeet @hhpthebook @nyknicks Yea was thinking Fournier was guard. But barter could be that too. That’s not a bad starting 5. And I was thinking the other day Fournier would be good off bench.@Keithm8033 @hhpthebook @nyknicks Fourniers.

They both have played really well for Detroit and could fill roles here@MzSweetFeet @hhpthebook @nyknicks That makes a lot of sense. Still tough on the Obi part. Also still only a playoff at best team. But who’s spot does he take?@hhpthebook @Keithm8033 @nyknicks I’d imagine he starts at SF, then slides to PF when Randle sits (if Toppin were to be part of the trade). Fournier would come off the bench but should still get 25+ minutes@hhpthebook @MzSweetFeet @nyknicks Needs some solid vets too though. Thought we had those too.@MzSweetFeet @hhpthebook @nyknicks I hear you. I like Grant too. But also, where does he play. Or when?
I just want character guys. I thought we had them then something happened@hhpthebook @Keithm8033 @nyknicks I'm ok if we move one to bring in a guy like grant who can score, plays great defense, shoots 3's well and can play both the 3/4 well.

They need to do something &amp; i don't see any teams wanting to trade for Kemba/Noel/Burks/Fournier before the deadline.@hhpthebook @nyknicks We all knew Thibs rarely plays young players.

Let the FO and coach work there way through it. The sky is not falling and no thibs does not hate obi. Good grief@Not47Buddz @DonBolo79 @hhpthebook @nyknicks He also drafted Obi over Haliburton when Knicks desperately needed a PG.  We could do much better in front office than Rose and Perry.@Not47Buddz @DonBolo79 @hhpthebook @nyknicks Scott Perry sucks.  Should have been fired with Steve Mills.  He drafted Knox over Alexander (PG).  He extended Randle.  He had the most cap space in NBA this offseason and look what he did with it.  Signed Fournier, Kemba, Noel and Burks and extended Randle.@jfromflorida1 @nyknicks We should have taken Donovan and Bridges instead of Frank and Knox. That’s not Silver@KnicksCentral What the hell makes u think the Celtics are trading Tatum for taj Gibson , D rose  and Bum ass Noel?I’m lost?
And I’m a @nyknicks fanThis is coaching malpractice. The @nyknicks are 4 games below 500 and last in the East, and yet Thibs can't find room in the rotation for Cam Reddish? Has he not figured out yet that his current rotation is NOT working? https://t.co/oBDe4Bf2g3@johnnyjohnjon83 @nyknicks No excuse dave stern saw the bigger picture with Chicago la nyc driving the league and the other teams following .. shoulda never put a franchise in Memphis and new orlenas@Not47Buddz @hhpthebook @nyknicks Ur argument doesnt clarify anything beyond blaming Mills for everything.

They aren't real receipts if ur asking me who the Pobo is.

A receipt is u showing me an article that said it was Solely Mills doing this or that.  All. speculative. U back to square 1@jfromflorida1 @nyknicks I hate stern he did get us ewing tho silver worseAy @drose nickname should be "The Captain" because the way he lead the @nyknicks is crazy. 🔥👀 These guys look up to him fr. The heart of the team. #NewYorkForever https://t.co/ahQSqGM2C5@hhpthebook @nyknicks He’s not signing players that builds on last years success. Now the season is in deep trouble.. It was a mistake. He can do a lot of good things and make mistakes too.@tommy_sage @nyknicks Silver is corny mr anothe stern
