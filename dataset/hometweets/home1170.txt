Both Ingram or DMitch would be the best player in Orlando by far, I don’t know why someone would only want 1 and not the other.@Bohemiangirl @Orangefish71 @Acyn Agreed. In Florida, it is open 365 days a year. Theme parks in other locations are generally seasonal. Keep in mind how HUGE Disney World is with Magic Kingdom, Epcot, Animal Kingdom, Hollywood Studio's, Typhoon Lagoon, Blizzard Beach and Disney Springs. Just in Orlando.The @OrlandoMagic need to show up, give their fans who have had to endure a brutal season a strong finish to the season. That starts with beating the Knicks today and then stealing another 2 wins out of these final few. Magic Fans deserve this.DasHaus made a bet!

💭 Will Franz continue his quest for 82? More minutes for Fultz/Cannady? #MagicTogether https://t.co/n0Y9468OyfRevenge Game: Evan Fournier plays Orlando tonight.  He played 409 games in his career for the Magic.@ORLmuse @OrlandoMagic Considering that we haven't played our starters many minutes, Suggs and Wendell have been injured, Fultz is under minutes restriction, and several players have 1 or 2 years in the league, that's very promising indeedThe Hornets (40-38) have 4 games left this season 

Their opponents:

Miami Heat (50-28)
Orlando Magic (20-58)
Chicago Bulls (45-33)
Washington Wizards (34-43)

What record do you think the Hornets will finish with? https://t.co/zarSVOzF7s@HoopsTalk13 Started trying to develop a Tim Duncan-esque bank game at the end of his Magic tenure.

Since the All-Star break the Orlando Magic have a defensive rating of 111.2 and an offensive rating of 105.7.

They are known for it...🚨BREAKING🚨

@OrlandoMagic player Bol Bol waived from team for “poor style choices”.

John Hammond, general manager, had this to say. “It’s more of a style thing then actual skill. He’s always wearing humiliating attire, just not the right fit for our organization." Per sources. https://t.co/pj7ArkAo65The @OrlandoMagic  need Mr. Banchero. #PaolOrlando@LionCuban @chili227 @rudedogreyes @megly71 @Montejp231 @emscharf @5280Keith @Juliolcubano @ArdelioValdes @IsVatIs @Realmommabear @MaureennKelly BTW: Adrian Griffin, had to drive 9 hours from Orlando (Raptors played the Magic last night) to New Orleans after his flight was cancelled to see his son play tonight.@YeahTeriq313 I won’t let Orlando Magic legend Gustavo Ayon be disrespected like this https://t.co/cwajqyD4VoPablo Banchero ain’t better than no Michael Porter or even Franz Wagner…..he’s probably top 5 in this NBA draft but Orlando Magics need to pass on buddy 🤷🏽‍♂️@Playdatetoronto @Raptors @OrlandoMagic Yeah the boys!The NCAA champion should play the worst team in the NBA as soon as the NBA regular season is over 

After the Orlando Magic win by 40 - then hopefully most people will realize just how good the average NBA player really is@TerrenceRoss is in the house! 💙

@OrlandoMagic 🤝 @OrlandoHockey https://t.co/pmmyDjgXyG@CHRIS_MAGIC_DCL Well….long story but we started driving to Tampa to try to catch our flight to DEN since the FLL was cancelled. But then the Tampa flight got cancelled so we changed routes to Orlando. Why not!Future Orlando Magic star balling early https://t.co/qYFuonIHohI don’t like Duke at all, but Paolo Banchero is going to have a really nice Orlando Magic career… #MFinalFour #MagicTogether@SagED_UP At the Brooklyn vs Orlando in Orlando where Kyrie score 60 points last month during Spring Break! The Nets smoked the Magic https://t.co/CbFqGQhmc8In his last 3 games, @_iggy_braz is averaging 12 points a game in 20minutes a game, on 60% shooting from the field, and 41.7% from downtown.

The way to expose Utah is have multiple self creators and dribble/drive penetration something warriors don’t have today 

No Steph + no rim pressure = Orlando magic like record for a reason 

Utah fighting for their lives@BlkExcel @jrichardgoodman I could argue that Magic also went against better teams so that’s irrelevant in context to each other. It’s what you did with your team vs those around you not your team vs the team 20 years separated from you. That Orlando team never won more than 44 games. Had a 21 win season.@WORLDSTAR Orlando magic home @SHAQI feel like I’m watching Orlando Magic vs the PistonsHoy a la 00:00 h.
