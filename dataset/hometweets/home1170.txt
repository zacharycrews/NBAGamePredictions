Both Ingram or DMitch would be the best player in Orlando by far, I don‚Äôt know why someone would only want 1 and not the other.@Bohemiangirl @Orangefish71 @Acyn Agreed. In Florida, it is open 365 days a year. Theme parks in other locations are generally seasonal. Keep in mind how HUGE Disney World is with Magic Kingdom, Epcot, Animal Kingdom, Hollywood Studio's, Typhoon Lagoon, Blizzard Beach and Disney Springs. Just in Orlando.The @OrlandoMagic need to show up, give their fans who have had to endure a brutal season a strong finish to the season. That starts with beating the Knicks today and then stealing another 2 wins out of these final few. Magic Fans deserve this.DasHaus made a bet!

That would be the 3rd best defense in the NBA, and the 2nd worst offense.

It‚Äôs something I guess.

The Mo Bamba experiment may end this offseason. With a traditional big in Wendell Carter Jr. on the roster, Magic can add the ‚Äúunicorn‚Äù they‚Äôve been wanting to develop Mo into. Chet‚Äôs a high-ceiling project and one thing Orlando has is time and patience. https://t.co/mZaIRBdQIX@BolWrld @BolBol I just moved to Orlando I applied for a job at the @OrlandoMagic if I get one I‚Äôll sell it to you üòÇüòÇanyone got the orlando magic shaq custom T ?@OrlandoMagic @admiralelite15 Admiral, you should check out our Orlando Alumni Group! @utkcfalumni We‚Äôd love to have you at an event soon!

@OrlandoMagic player Bol Bol waived from team for ‚Äúpoor style choices‚Äù.

John Hammond, general manager, had this to say. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs more of a style thing then actual skill. He‚Äôs always wearing humiliating attire, just not the right fit for our organization."

The way to expose Utah is have multiple self creators and dribble/drive penetration something warriors don‚Äôt have today 

No Steph + no rim pressure = Orlando magic like record for a reason 

Utah fighting for their lives@BlkExcel @jrichardgoodman I could argue that Magic also went against better teams so that‚Äôs irrelevant in context to each other. It‚Äôs what you did with your team vs those around you not your team vs the team 20 years separated from you. That Orlando team never won more than 44 games.
