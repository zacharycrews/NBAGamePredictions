Still wondering how he hasnt been traded or get any PT yet this season since it is crazy to see talent being wasted #freebagleyNBA Farewell Tour stops in Sacramento today and while he can’t be here (he’s retired) needed to honor the Original Hick From French Lick, Jerry Reynolds, not that Larry Bird guy.

Nobody here is going to claim the 2006-2021 Sacramento Kings were good at any point. This is trending to be their best or second-best year in that window and that means, like, 39 wins.@flauntinbird @furkyfurkfurk2 @Peak_Process @realrealdavidba @WorldWideWob "Loser"/"Winner" isn't a real stat, like QB wins. Don't know if you know this about the Sacramento Kings but every player they've had since 2006 has been on a team with a losing record every year because the teams have largely been very bad.@Farbod_E Mitch Richmond @SacramentoKings@SacramentoKings Kings taking the championship 👀🙏@SacramentoKings Let’s get it!

He knows how to contribute in this offense.  He is all in as a team player.@youngwhiteside Hey Hassan. I was so stoked when we got the best rebounder in Sacramento and was glad to have you back. The Kings never played you though and we were the worst rebounding team! Sac Kings are a bunch of idiots.@SacramentoKings @TyHaliburton22 Love his energy !!Kings -2 💵 +2u
