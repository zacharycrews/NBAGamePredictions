Thanks@trailblazers @Bucks @ROOTSPORTS_NW @RipCityRadio620 Lineup?@trailblazers Dear New Faces, Because of a terrible TV deal with @ROOTSPORTS_NW, no one will actually get to watch you guys play. Bummer.This time of year I usually do a single team @NBA league pass subscription. Since the @trailblazers are officially tanking, do I go for the GSW, Suns, or maybe the Grizzlies?@Colingalvin2 @TupacHomie0of @al1g8t0r @trailblazers @CarMax Winslow and Bledsoe are lengthy defending playmakers. That’s what the team lacks. I’m assuming the management is going to try and get a scorer and or somewhat of a primary option with a CJ package. We also will have a lottery pick that we can build around if we send Dame.@corvallisonian @trailblazers About the same as everyone else. Kinda meh, but not heartbroken, like when Rodney was traded. As long as Dennis Smith Jr makes it to the end of the season, he'll be ok.Game day Vs Bucks @ModaCenter @trailblazers #RipCity https://t.co/q9bI4kivsvThe @trailblazers have a chance to face 3 #RipCity legends on the court at once tonight: Wes, Hood, and Connaughton@trailblazers @BrickThicket Ok, that's cute🏀 NBA ACTION!

Simmons would offer more 2-way versatility than Trent Jr. While Dame slashes, a lot of his game is perimeter-based too. Simmons would be a post threat, so you have a hood inside-out game for half-court sets plus you still have the fast-break action.@tcbbiggs @wehaveatake @trailblazers Can’t wait to have my mind blown 🤯❤️Tonight's starting lineup for the Portland Trail Blazers: Simons, McCollum, Elleby, Snell, Nurkic https://t.co/bVWH4AMCA2@germanlo123 @trailblazers You've been to a blazers game.

Simons + Gary would've been an excellent backcourt.

Even better with Simmons at PF/C because Gary's game doesn't depend on shots at the now congested rim.

Either way trading 23 year old Gary for 32 Bledsoe was beyond stupid.@trailblazers are they playing?Some new faces in the building 👋 https://t.co/Dlo4T831xy@KLOEforLIFE @statmuse @trailblazers No, because Simmons would be a point-forward or point-center.@brothersambuca @trailblazers The spread at times lol, but they can’t even cover that smhLarry Nance, Jr. Suffers “Little Setback” with Knee Injury: Photo by Soobum Im/Getty Images

They also give up Russ and Give up 2 first round picks and 1 second round thats fair. They get Dame back and add so wings in Lary nance and svi (welcome back) and tim is only injured for nowJustise Winslow @IAmJustise (trade pending) out Sat vs the @Bucks !

The trade between the Trail @trailblazers  and @LAClippers  still needs to officially go through, so Winslow isn't yet able to debut for Portland

Basically they needed to choose b/w CJ, Ant &amp; Norm. They definitely want Ant more cuz they dealt Norm. Yet Im scratching my head cuz Chauncey says they’re trying to build a championship caliber roaster! Yet Norm 🤦🏻‍♀️🤷🏻‍♀️@MikellMoon @statmuse @trailblazers So they will have 2 ball dominant starting PGs?@mjv0217 @brothersambuca @npowell2404 @trailblazers No, they're literally super heated because all they got back was a pile of backwoods for 2 quality NBA players@brothersambuca @GTJXNormSzn @npowell2404 @trailblazers Well they traded Norm to have flexibility in salary to re-sign Ant. Isn’t that what many Blazers fans want?I keep hearing that the @trailblazers just need better players for us to win games. The Thunder just beat us twice in short order, would you rather swap our team roster with theirs? Or could there be other issues with the Blazers?Love seeing someone who works hard, is willing to grow, and takes care of others get a great opportunity at the highest of levels!

Excited for @j_luhnow and everything that comes his way with the @trailblazers 

We are grateful for his help over the past 3 years!!! https://t.co/vdqKTvFM6d@linareeg @trailblazers I was daydreaming earlier on of trading CJ and RoCo for Ben Simmons. Then CJ got hurt and Philly was too stubborn anyway@linareeg @trailblazers What they got in return is not good. No 1st rd draft picks.@linareeg @trailblazers I actually agree with you about moving CJ over Norm but once the season seemed lost they tried to recoup some of the money spent on Norm.@chrisloyd49 @whytefolks1 @trailblazers @okcthunder @ModaCenter @ROOTSPORTS_NW @RipCityRadio620 He is a great player. Been clutch his whole career. Beat the nuggets in that series a few years ago. Beat the grizz in the play in game. Blazer fans hate him so much it seems. I hope they trade him to Mavs it somewhere with a distributor.Let me help, Shamit

CC: @SacramentoKings @trailblazers  @vivek https://t.co/18ZTBUSCqz@CharlesLevinso6 @trailblazers I think Nance can still make an impact if healthy. Well at least I hope so.

I’m sure they’ll trade Dame for some benchwarmer. They always leave me smh@linareeg @trailblazers The thing with Norm@was he was tying up a lot of money in a losing cause. Nance was the disappointment to me. I had high hopes for him on this team@ashxmil @ShamsCharania Dude. Moses Malone was drafted by NBA's Portland Trail Blazers in 1976 from (ABA) Spirits of St Louis as 5th pick, 1st round in 1976. The ABA was transitioned into the NBA.

RoCo would’ve been a free agent and not sure if Dame will play again this season.

I watch the clippers for Serge now there is another reason. I have lots of Raptors merch you signed. Thrilled to meet you in your events back in Toronto. You will always be a Raptor to me. 🍀🍀🍀The Portland Trail Blazers were garbage before the trade. Now they are even more garbage. Sad@trailblazers what’s a guy need to do to earn that follow@VicLombardi @trailblazers I think it is a trade to setup another trade.  With all of the injuries in the NBA.  This will be the year a sleeper like when Toronto won.  If we can get Murray and MPJ back.   we might be able to steal this one.🚨 Line Change 🚨

(Except if they trade for Dame, but unlikely to happen and he doesn’t have the same value than last year…) https://t.co/5xZnONnTXl@trailblazers @AnferneeSimons @CJMcCollum @EllebyCj @TonySnell21_ @bosnianbeast27 @stormxio LETS GOOOOO@Nex_oc @trailblazers @AnferneeSimons @CJMcCollum @EllebyCj @TonySnell21_ @bosnianbeast27 @stormxio Seeing roco on the starting 5 was already poverty@Doubledown_A @trailblazers @CHold Powell's contract is fine. That's small city thinking there to think it's some big overpay. It's in line with other contracts for players on his level.@trailblazers @AnferneeSimons @CJMcCollum @EllebyCj @TonySnell21_ @bosnianbeast27 @stormxio Damn 😔 https://t.co/ygKKsL7yhX@ToreyJonesYT @PortlandPlsWin @trailblazers @npowell2404 You sound like a guy that should have their Google search investigated. I’m telling you, those underage nudes searches could come back to bite ya.@trailblazers What’s wrong with you guys? 😭Hosting my first home game, sorry it’s because the great @brookeolzendam is on the bench recovering, but glad to be able to be back with the fantastic Blazers Broadcasting team. #RipCity @trailblazers https://t.co/fAHkq1b0zb@npowell2404 @trailblazers I appreciated how you always took the ball to the rack when you got it.

You do you.@octdesertlover @kimmyann1111 @trailblazers @npowell2404 @Holla_At_Rob33 I enjoyed Powell and RoCo during their time in a Blazer uniform.  I may even root harder for them to compensate for my disappointment in them being moved, but I get that it's a business - first and foremost. I wish @npowell2404 &amp; @Holla_At_Rob33 every bit of success!@trailblazers @AnferneeSimons @CJMcCollum @EllebyCj @TonySnell21_ @bosnianbeast27 @stormxio First career start for little CJ 😁Thank you for this @trailblazers #ripcity https://t.co/LKVoQvXzvV@trailblazers @AnferneeSimons @CJMcCollum @EllebyCj @TonySnell21_ @bosnianbeast27 @stormxio Lets go team!@trailblazers @AnferneeSimons @CJMcCollum @EllebyCj @TonySnell21_ @bosnianbeast27 @stormxio Anfernee simons masterclass@trailblazers @AnferneeSimons @CJMcCollum @EllebyCj @TonySnell21_ @bosnianbeast27 @stormxio I just fell down to my knees in Walgreens@trailblazers @AnferneeSimons @CJMcCollum @EllebyCj @TonySnell21_ @bosnianbeast27 @stormxio Simons 25 Tonight@trailblazers @AnferneeSimons @CJMcCollum @EllebyCj @TonySnell21_ @bosnianbeast27 @stormxio Waterboy@ToreyJonesYT @PortlandPlsWin @trailblazers @npowell2404 My guess, they know more than you do.@trailblazers @AnferneeSimons @CJMcCollum @EllebyCj @TonySnell21_ @bosnianbeast27 @stormxio seeing snell start makes everything so much worse then it already is@KrishGraphics @npowell2404 @trailblazers Heavily depressed rn but goddamn that's a nice graphic.
