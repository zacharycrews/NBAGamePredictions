Clippers are probably one of the best bounce back teams over the past couple years ats. Kings just missing too many people for my liking. LA gets Paul George back, big bonus. Sacramento doesn't play defense to begin with@kayte_c @SacramentoKings Kayte, you are awesome by giving tickets away!  Making someone’s day. We’ll be there tonight!  Hopefully, it will be a King’s win!@kayte_c @SacramentoKings My daughter and I would love to go!!@orithous @DeuceMason @StocktonKings @SacramentoKings Too kind, appreciate you Bryce. 🥺 I would use this money to make a real podcast studio and Deuce could never complain about dogs knocking over the camera tripod again🙏🏼@kayte_c @SacramentoKings Your my favorite NBA analyst!I’m selling 2 tix in section 121 for @SacramentoKings v @dallasmavs on New Years Eve.

Are freaking amazing! They’re working for the @StocktonKings and the @SacramentoKings, and they’re podcast shows how dedicated they are to their work, and how lucky we are to have them in sac. https://t.co/EZU7PgSATcReally not sure what to expect from tonight's Clippers-Kings game.

Sacramento has a bunch of guys out, but LA's top 3 shooters are out, Paul George is still working his way back from injury, and Nic Batum will likely still be limited too.sign him to a 10 day you cowards @SacramentoKings https://t.co/1BFohSVlKn@DavidBr37616769 @iDude14 @Lakers Sixers want a young star. Fox wants off kings. Sac gets Westbrook Whos Sacramento can’t get superstars that will play there. Sac has shooters which would fit Westbrook better. Lakers get expiring thompson and take on 2 bigger contracts to that will help themI hope one day the Sacramento kings see Sean Nobles tweets and think “wow. We should listen to him and trade DeAaron Fox to Philly. He’s so smart”@Bballalberts31 @bucksinfour @deaconjuelz @Bucks @SacramentoKings @NBA @spurs @cavs @BrooklynNets @ATLHawks @sixers Love on the @sixers playing pf along side Embiid @ C, Harris @ SF, Curry @ SG &amp; Schroeder @ PG, Philly has a good chance at winning it all this year@Guerren @SacramentoKings @thekingsherald Ha, Indeed!@wetzelv @SacramentoKings @thekingsherald Add matching hat. If that doesn’t work, remember: https://t.co/m8yTyE3Okv@RyanPohl34 @bucksinfour @deaconjuelz @Bucks @SacramentoKings @NBA @spurs @cavs @BrooklynNets @ATLHawks @sixers Because they can afford it. He is 5th in+/- and a solid 6th man. D. Wade is bad. Only positive he has is spot shooting. He cant guard anyone or rebound. Lauri is playing the right amount of time for his skillset. They will destroy the Hawks, probaly go 6 games with sixers and winWhy does the Sacramento Kings G-League go so hard https://t.co/vrFNTJThMjYoo @SacramentoKings your IG story was really sus 👀@ChrisVernonShow  @KevinOConnorNBA you bugging fam if you think we @nyknicks  fans trading   @RjBarrett6 for @swipathefox‼️No way we would never RJ made the playoffs in his second year and the “media”predicted the same amount of wins with the @SacramentoKings 20-23 #TheMisMatchThe @sacramentokings face the Clippers back at home tonight!

Right now the Cavs can afford Love, so why take a vital piece out of a successful equation?@RyanPohl34 @bucksinfour @deaconjuelz @Bucks @SacramentoKings @NBA @spurs @cavs @sixers I am a Cavs fan and a fan of basketball. There is more to a team then points scored. Cavs have a better shot than philly right now to go to the finals. Nets and the bucks are the two teams to beat and the current Cavs roster doesnt match up well with either.Tyreek Evans should always have a home with the Sacramento Kings.@wetzelv @SacramentoKings @thekingsherald Should work!!In 2021, Princepal Singh emerged from @NBAIndia and signed with the @StocktonKings of the @nbagleague.

It’s irritating as hell to watch game after game. Lue has to see it too. Pass the damn basketball until a good shot is there!The Sacramento Kings are bringing back Chris Webber and Jason Williams on 10 day contracts!@Bballalberts31 @bucksinfour @deaconjuelz @Bucks @SacramentoKings @NBA @spurs @cavs He isn't a franchise player but he would definitely help a team like the @sixers competing for a 🏆. The @cavs aren't winning a 🏆 with or without Love so they're better off getting picks &amp; a young player like Wagner for him. Richardson will make up for the points Love scoredThere have been 259 different iterations of NBA teams that have posted a record of .500 or better over the last 15 years.

The Sacramento Kings are nowhere to be found on that list.Holiday spirit or hoping to get on TV/Jumbotron at @SacramentoKings game tonight? @thekingsherald https://t.co/J9NeCcaPfXA new fresh fit 🦁
