#nba #picks #betting #basketball #nbaplayoffs #milwaukeebucks #no #chicagobulls #sportsbetsMilwaukee Bucks All-Star guard Kris Middleton is out for the remainder of the series against the Chicago Bulls. 

@ralphpolojames looks at three ways the Bulls can beat the Bucks and advance to the second round.

Read the article below:

https://t.co/zbbH7ckpRu@xmariomc @DRR124kta @chicagobulls This may sound like blasphemy but I didn’t expect the Bulls to even win one game. We’ve played like ass the last quarter of the season. Bucks (and other top 6 East teams) crushed us. At the very least now this 1st round will be highly entertaining. No walk in the park. Good luck!The Milwaukee Bucks (-2.5) are up against the Chicago Bulls (+2.5) at 8:30 PM EDT today.

100% of Shark Pick users are taking MIL (-2.5, -109) and 0% are taking CHI (+2.5, -108).

Who do you like?@chicagobulls what we on tonight??!!! U see it. Suck it @Bucks https://t.co/AmwLIg4whPThis week's @gruber_law One Call, That's All for the weekend:

@espnhomer - Brook Lopez goes for 30 points in Bucks Game 3 win. 

@AnalystTSmith34 - Nets lose to Celtics in Game 3.

That’s better. Tbh last yr I didn’t expect the Bucks to make a deep run. There was a couple “divine” moments (like KD’s foot not being an centimeter shorter lol) that helped, but it’s how you take advantage. Middleton heated up at the right time and Giannis is a winner. GameThe perf early birthday gift would be a single ticket to a Bulls playoff game, just sayin’. 📢 @chicagobulls #seered@chicagosky @chicagobulls @BMOHarrisBank @ptitecao Bucks in 5Hey #NFTCommunity we have a our second matchup tonight!

@Bucks and @chicagobulls at 8:30PM est!@chicagobulls @BMOHarrisBank @ptitecao Let’s gooo 🔥🔥 #SeeRed@secretschools @DRR124kta @chicagobulls MJ went home early many times until he got Phil and Pippen along with other very good roll players. If the Bucks lose this series to the Bulls I’d agree that’s a major disappointment for a team defending the title even missing their second best playerI’m going to the bulls game tonight @chicagobulls I’m on a 4 game losing streak 🤣🤣@chicagobulls @BMOHarrisBank @farfanart Please 🙏🙏🙏🙏@xmariomc @DRR124kta @chicagobulls Thanks for that. I can’t see the same for a lot of other bucks fans. That really irked me in a way I wasn’t expecting from a team that just won a chip. Let’s just chalk this up as a dope new rivalry that’ll hopefully give us years of good battles!@chicagobulls @BMOHarrisBank @farfanart awesome thank you good luck @chicagobulls@secretschools @bullsssssssssk @DRR124kta @chicagobulls No I’d say making the playoffs is a successful season but how far you go depends if you have like the Bucks the best player in the league your expectations are higher than a Bulls team who hasn’t been in the playoffs for awhile. So I’d say the Bulls season was a success already.LFG BULLS!! @chicagobullsGlad @Bucks @chicagobulls is an indoor affair at the @UnitedCenter  #Bucks https://t.co/T33zplyM5v@chicagobulls @BMOHarrisBank @farfanart All mine are old and dirty. I need a new one! https://t.co/FtPDML9GqdOur fans had a tough time choosing between the @chicagobulls and @Bucks. Who ya got? 🤔

Don't forget to make your picks before the tip-off of Game 3! ➡️ https://t.co/XaIPXqXgCE https://t.co/drjRm89B33@xmariomc @DRR124kta @chicagobulls I really hope he is. Να ‘σαι καλά ρε Γιάννη, lol. 

But not if the Bulls dismantle him in the first round. MJ never went home that early.

Whatever happened this season is wiped off the plate. You had our number early on but this is the playoffs baby! Anything can happen.Chicago Bulls are prepared to fight through the defending champions.

Not as annoying as yours though. 

I'll stick some coffee in a mug Nd water in the kettle too 😂

The things we must do as UK Bulls fans.@UKWasimPerviz @RealKevinNash @HulkHogan @EBischoff Agreed NWO is the best stable.  Whenever you add a Chicago bull to your stable you’re popular.

For me they beat:
Dx, 4 horsemen, bulletclub, dungeon of doom, the shield, evolution@nflplaya77 @Rob_Shenanigans While yes Bruce was from Chicago I believe he was always a Cleveland sports fan atleast the Indians. I’m not really a fan of Bull so just hating to hate 🤷‍♂️So @Ticketmaster and/or @chicagobulls saw there was more action for that game on the website and started jacking up the prices in real time. To the tune of $70 more a piece. 👎👎👎 @michael_rapino @TMFanSupportNever seen this before from @Ticketmaster:

During the 4th quarter of the @chicagobulls -Bucks game on Wednesday, I went on TM to see if there were any good seats for Sunday's game. Pretty good 200 Level seats for $159 before fees (face, not resale). Solid deal for a playoff game@chicagobulls @BMOHarrisBank @farfanart That is sick! All geared up for seeing @DeMar_DeRozan or as he's called in mine,.DeMan bring it today.@BigOnBulls @chicagobulls Good idea mate. I made the mistake of getting comfy and putting a film on before Wednesdays 2:30am tip off. Dozed right off. Missed the game. Still kicking myself 😂😭@FDSportsbook @chicagobulls ShaSweet@TLover229 We Got Off Yomi's Back

And nobody in Wisconsin gives a fuck about a WNBA team. They lose $, how the fuck is that “being broke” think before you talk. But it’s that Illinois eduction, ranks bottom 30 percentile in the nation. Damn shame.@JMillsGoBlue @MVPinitials @stackNshares @AaronWilson_NFL If you’re talking multiple sports in our adult lives, now, you’re gonna lose that one pretty quick to Chicago. Bulls and Hawks dynasties alone take the “sports city” argument home. Your Packers are almost up there with the Bills for continually falling short of a title though.Sorry I'm going to call Bull on this. This is right outside Chicago in a very rich very white conservative area.

Charlotte Hornets (Swap out Heyward).
Toronto Raptors (Swap out Pascal Siakam).
Chicago Bulls (Swap out Vucevic/White/Brown). 

Realistically, I think it's Toronto though, best fit.

https://t.co/Fbrs0RkfgH📅 On this day in 1988, the @chicagobulls Charles Oakley grabbed a career-high 35 rebounds in a loss to the Cavs.

No player has matched or exceeded Oakley's total since. In fact, he and Moses Malone are the only players in the last 50 NBA seasons to record a 35-rebound game. https://t.co/WPu1d48xFeWill The Chicago Bulls Take Control Of The Series ? https://t.co/yBdN59utgF@chicagobulls True definition of a gym rat , but then again if I had unlimited access to the UC I’d be living up in there.The Milwaukee #Bucks🦌 went 7-9 ATS this season without Khris Middleton.

I wish that Zach was out there with Demar.Am always about Chelsea FC but this year's NBA play offs have some the best match up series in history imo 

My top series are most definitely Brooklyn Nets/ Boston Celtics, Memphis Grizzlies/Timberwolves and Bucks/Chicago Bulls

I’ll go first. Most worried about Bucks coming into Game 3 trying to push us around, and we try to match them muscle to muscle. Not our game and would give them a HUGE (no pun intended) advantage.

Chicago Bulls@wiscoszn @chilerrato What do they win? Milwaukee won a chip &amp; everyone loses their mind, meanwhile they may lose to the poverty bulls, who at one point ran not just the NBA but the entire globe. Blackhawks had a dynasty.
