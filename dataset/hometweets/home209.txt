I’d put Draymond Green on KD as Draymond is GSW’s best defender and Steph on Harden as shooter on shooter, crafty on crafty. I don’t think Bruce Brown or Patty Mills can slow down Steph unless he comes out cold as ice. Mills?

The jersey I got was swing man but at the nets store they didn’t have any authentics. I think fanatics, Nike and other stores would have them tho. But I haven’t seen any.@OfficialNBARefs @WashWizards @BrooklynNets @NBATV Hey number 31, wtf kind of all is this? https://t.co/BRpeUUXawB@hft_trading1988 If you want to base a pick on only their last game then sure. If you want to look at the entire season of data, the Warriors are a better team by every metric. And if you are looking at common opponents, that same Charlotte team beat the Nets by 16 IN BROOKLYN. Hornets are tough!@AASpark27 @GodlLotus @BrooklynNets Ya but the are the two best in league so whoever loses people gonna call second best@getnickwright said trade Porzingis for Kyrie. Kristaps gets a triumphant return to NY and they might elect Kyrie governor of Texas(because he refuses to vaxx) 🤣🤣🤣🤣

Over 12.5 points scored (-112) No Joe Harris or Paul Millsap tonight for BKN@rm_83 @KamguiaS @BrooklynNets But he still a rookie, 100% nash wouldn't trust him in a game like this

You can win 🔥🔥 ❣️@KamguiaS @BrooklynNets Lol Cam Thomas is a professional scorer he will make mistakes hear and there but he will give you 12+ points easilyMy inclination is that the Golden State Warriors will really shade gaps well w/ the Brooklyn Nets down Joe Harris, and that the Nets should probably start somebody else besides Blake Griffin, if this were a playoff game.

I get/agree with Steve Nash’s trust in Griffin though.@GodlLotus @BrooklynNets it’s gonna be a great night on twitter regardless@bigzoroenergy @BrooklynNets you mean kd vs the warriors **@BrooklynNets smokin dat gsw pacc today 😎@BrooklynNets whoever wins this game fanbase gonna be toxic to the max😂@BrooklynNets Curry vs y’all tonight watch https://t.co/eGyCGPnqy3@BrooklynNets Wish Harris was playing but at least cam Thomas will get lots of minutes and drop 12+🏀Golden State Warriors #DubNation vs Brooklyn Nets #NetsWorld⌚️7:30PM 🖥TNT #NBA75 #NBA https://t.co/mBmBnFbPJl@BrooklynNets Fightreacts better carry some tissues with him!
