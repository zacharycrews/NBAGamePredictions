The Wizards have been eliminated from playoff contention. Atlanta is still in the hunt for a spot in the playoffs, so this game is important.

They will be coming from last nights loss while the Wizards are on a high.

Can they pull this off? https://t.co/wENZqsnaj1@hey_gab01 @ATLHawks Thanks Gabriel for all you do in sharing strong trend plays with us, I'm in on this trend and going against the Bulls trend again in the 1st Half vs Celtics.Last home game of regular season for @atlhawks  kinda happy lol  !! S let’s see what happens for playoffs! #TrueToAtlanta https://t.co/OrzA24baFTTrae Young is quite literally the Atlanta Hawks offense. How many players are more important to a team’s playoff hopes than Trae? https://t.co/9q1WQd1zkc@Stillncrj1 @ATLHawks Good point but Raptors are next level wing spans. 

Any how why does our coach not change the game plan is the problem.

You think Coach Lou, Nurse, Spoelstra would have the same game plan? You think Lou would play at any point? You think TLC would sniff the starting lineup? https://t.co/bNbAE6sDZ8Forever grateful to the Atlanta Hawks https://t.co/6X8yxupvet@ATLienSportsFan @ATLHawks Hunter-7ft wing span, Huerter’s wingspan 6’10, TLC Wingspan close to Hunter’s.

He was a complete nonfactor compared to how he usually bangs in the paint.@Stillncrj1 @ATLHawks Could we have tried OO and Capela for like 5 minutes to stabilize the rebound issue?@Stillncrj1 @ATLHawks It's all good tho, I don't think that game was anything to panic about. Raps are a tough matchup when we're missing both rotational power forwards. We were right there in the game even with getting destroyed on the glass.@Stillncrj1 @ATLHawks I agree, I harped all last night about us getting killed on the boards. Clint was dog tired halfway thru the 4th because he was doing the majority of the work battling. Nobody was boxing out and Raps already have a big lineup. JJ is a good rebounder (6 min) and needed more from O@ATLHawks @emoryhealthcare I need #WallpaperWednesdays back@spojunky @ATLHawks Siakim scored 2 points in the 4th quarter. He did so his damage in quarters 1-3. When u get out worked on the glass (74-48) . And with that offensive rebounds they hot and converted put backs and a free 3s. You not winning that game.

#AtlantaHawks #Basketball #Georgia #NationalBasketballAssociation #NBAEasternConference #NBAEasternConferenceSoutheastDivision https://t.co/VEwXumvRcq@Stillncrj1 @ATLHawks I think those were the two glaring mistakes.. rebounding and rotations. Rebounding was by far the #1 culprit for sure, but they also took too long to try something diff as Siakam bullied TLC and the all-bench units were not good either. Kills any momentum when they play subpar.@ATLienSportsFan @ATLHawks Again the rotations did not lose the game. Giving up 20 offensive in which toronto scored on every one expect for like 2.@Stillncrj1 @ATLHawks It shouldn’t be if he sits down our scoring goes too. And he isn’t out rebounding anyone either. We want Trae to be prime time every night, everyone else has to fill in the gaps every night with defense, rebounding, movement etc.@Stillncrj1 @ATLHawks The rotation is not only with Trae. Would have liked more minutes for Delon and OO. Maybe even playing Capela and OO together. 

TLC and Lou provided limited help yesterday.@ATLHawks @TheTraeYoung @UPS Whos the first?@jen_ch0i @ATLHawks sigh..........fine@ayyyeSherixx @ATLHawks I just don’t understand like what’s not to understand 🤣😂🤣. Folks talking bout rotations and Trae’s mins. I’m like bro we got out rebounded by 40 damn near@Stillncrj1 @ATLHawks Single handedly lost us the game was that effort inside on both sides of the ball.@ATLHawks I enjoyd the 1st 90% of this game.Yesterday

Hunter HAS to basket cut here if Barnes is gonna sell out on Trae from the nail. He has a layup if he wants it. 

Huerter 45 cut on the first play in the same situation and it collapsed the defense and led to a bucket https://t.co/5vQCz9i1rg https://t.co/E2yHi6Jl7dSharife Cooper has been recalled to the Atlanta Hawks.

1. Lazy (loose balls and rebounds except CC)
2. Soft (Too finesse)
3. Short (No 7 footers)
4. Coaching (Nate is stubborn and is retarded regarding in game adjustments)
5. Low IQ plays@NBA @SacramentoKings @PelicansNBA Hawks vs Raptors hit 226 (118-108) @Raptors  @ATLHawks@ATLHawks Trae needs another star player playing by his side. We desperately need another great shooter outside of Trae. And our GM didn’t make any trades this season. Smdh 🙄. We’re not going far y’all. I hope we get to the playoffs but right now, I’m not getting my hopes up.Pascal Siakam scored a game-high 31 points and the Toronto Raptors clinched an Eastern Conference playoff spot by responding to losing a late lead with eight straight points that helped produce a 118-108 victory over the visiting Atlanta Hawks. https://t.co/OSUOFh2BAS@ATLHawks We were undersized and could’ve used JC in the game. Especially for the rebounding. Cap didn’t play well and then he sat on the sidelines instead of playing when the Raptors went big. That was dumb on Coach’s part.@leesaidwhat @ATLHawks 🤞🏽 we will see what happens@HawksMuse @statmuse @ATLHawks @TheTraeYoung Morant could never@nasakku @chicagobulls If you can play like 2021 Atlanta Hawks, toppling Philly won't be impossible and their HC is Doc Rivers. But I forget you don't have defensive quality C like Capela or F John Collins to slow Embiid@MisterJones67 @ATLHawks we really gotta get into that 7/8 game! no more losses 🤞🤞🤞the real losers are the atlanta hawks https://t.co/vQSXttQ340tough loss @ATLHawks@qudah_khaled @TwoWayPascal @TrolledByGTJ @TraeFor3 @ATLHawks Demar and Bron are SF.

Should not even have had one lmao@ATLHawks @MichelobULTRA @delonwright @LeaderOfHorde I'm not worried.

Trae carrie’s@enra6ed @ATLHawks This is a normal fred game 😭😭 he fucking sucks. And if the refs were normal we'd be up by 40 unironicallyThe Toronto Raptors are about to beat the Atlanta Hawks and will likely leap frog the Bulls for the No. 5 seed if this Bucks lead stands.

That drops the Bulls to the No. 6 slot, which could be the Bucks or 76ers depending on how this week goes.@ATLHawks Do the coaches ever COACH blocking out?@GottaluvluvA @ATLHawks You’re right, if Vanvleet had a normal night we’d be up 30BITCH FUCK YOU @ATLHawks https://t.co/bukE4BdLWw@AlexCampa11 @ATLHawks Shot that quick three then took a fadeaway double teamed@AlexCampa11 @ATLHawks He sold two possessions bro 😓@ATLHawks don’t go chasing Waterfalls on your way back, darlings@4eslclub @ATLHawks Every time@putemupcdukes @Raptors @ATLHawks If this a playoff game then this ref crew don’t need to be working it 🤷🏾‍♂️ easy to hit big shots when you can play football on the other end.@HometeamBleak @ATLHawks Can you explain why we took 2 timeouts when they were ice cold &amp; we were on a run?

1. Lazy (loose balls and rebounds except CC)
2. Soft (Too finesse)
3. Short (No 7 footers)
4. Coaching (Nate can't make in game adjustments and is stubborn)
5. Fundamentals (plays with a low basketball IQ and that includes Trae)@ATLHawks Let’s go Hawks!@MikeBellATL @ATLHawks Cavs lost to lowly magic.

Also Collins and Gallo are injured which is the only reason why Nate is playing JJ in the first place. Again, I think both rookies should have been given minutes earlier in the season, but that just didn’t happen.@ATLHawks @WorldWideWob you see this?The Atlanta Hawks effect: 18 point advantage from 3 but still losing cause they can't guard inside the arc or rebound.

Not because I'd be worried about the @BrooklynNets (who are a mess and can't play defense).

OMG, the pass.the Atlanta Hawks would beat the Miami Heat in a 7-game series@smhvibe @ATLHawks I mean, he played pretty good defense guarding KD, his 55 against us wasn't easy by the way he was being guarded. I definitely don't think he special, but I'd say he's probably a slightly blow to Average starting caliber player.
