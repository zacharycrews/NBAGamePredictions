The Wizards have been eliminated from playoff contention. Atlanta is still in the hunt for a spot in the playoffs, so this game is important.

They will be coming from last nights loss while the Wizards are on a high.

Can they pull this off? https://t.co/wENZqsnaj1@hey_gab01 @ATLHawks Thanks Gabriel for all you do in sharing strong trend plays with us, I'm in on this trend and going against the Bulls trend again in the 1st Half vs Celtics.Last home game of regular season for @atlhawks  kinda happy lol  !!

How many players are more important to a team‚Äôs playoff hopes than Trae? https://t.co/9q1WQd1zkc@Stillncrj1 @ATLHawks Good point but Raptors are next level wing spans. 

Any how why does our coach not change the game plan is the problem.

You think Coach Lou, Nurse, Spoelstra would have the same game plan? You think Lou would play at any point? You think TLC would sniff the starting lineup? https://t.co/bNbAE6sDZ8Forever grateful to the Atlanta Hawks https://t.co/6X8yxupvet@ATLienSportsFan @ATLHawks Hunter-7ft wing span, Huerter‚Äôs wingspan 6‚Äô10, TLC Wingspan close to Hunter‚Äôs.

Raps are a tough matchup when we're missing both rotational power forwards. We were right there in the game even with getting destroyed on the glass.@Stillncrj1 @ATLHawks I agree, I harped all last night about us getting killed on the boards. Clint was dog tired halfway thru the 4th because he was doing the majority of the work battling. Nobody was boxing out and Raps already have a big lineup.

#AtlantaHawks #Basketball #Georgia #NationalBasketballAssociation #NBAEasternConference #NBAEasternConferenceSoutheastDivision https://t.co/VEwXumvRcq@Stillncrj1 @ATLHawks I think those were the two glaring mistakes.. rebounding and rotations. Rebounding was by far the #1 culprit for sure, but they also took too long to try something diff as Siakam bullied TLC and the all-bench units were not good either. Kills any momentum when they play subpar.@ATLienSportsFan @ATLHawks Again the rotations did not lose the game. Giving up 20 offensive in which toronto scored on every one expect for like 2.@Stillncrj1 @ATLHawks It shouldn‚Äôt be if he sits down our scoring goes too. And he isn‚Äôt out rebounding anyone either. We want Trae to be prime time every night, everyone else has to fill in the gaps every night with defense, rebounding, movement etc.@Stillncrj1 @ATLHawks The rotation is not only with Trae. Would have liked more minutes for Delon and OO. Maybe even playing Capela and OO together.
