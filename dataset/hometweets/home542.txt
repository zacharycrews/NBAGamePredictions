Let's go.@bballbby @Yougoneseethed1 @ThatBoyGabe2338 @speedySanchez10 @Nate_moseby @balldontstop @BrooklynNets Belligerently wrong@ThatBoyGabe2338 @Yougoneseethed1 @Dizastrous_ @speedySanchez10 @Nate_moseby @balldontstop @BrooklynNets I'd say combining his athleticism with his lay up package and handles, MJ is in the same class as Kobe, KD and Kyrie@Dizastrous_ @Yougoneseethed1 @ThatBoyGabe2338 @speedySanchez10 @Nate_moseby @balldontstop @BrooklynNets He is not.@Yougoneseethed1 @ThatBoyGabe2338 @speedySanchez10 @Nate_moseby @bballbby @balldontstop @BrooklynNets You are wrong@Dizastrous_ @ThatBoyGabe2338 @speedySanchez10 @Nate_moseby @bballbby @balldontstop @BrooklynNets Just cuase a player is more skilled doesn't mean they are better. Kobe is more skilled than jordan, but jordan is better than kobe. Curry is better then ky, but im not saying kyrie is better. Kyrie is the most skilled player in the league right now. Offensively@GrizzliesPR @memgrizz @BrooklynNets Hoping we see this lineup:

Morant
Bane
Tillie
JJJ
Adams

Tyus
Culver
Sneed
Aldama
Clarke@ThatBoyGabe2338 @Dizastrous_ @speedySanchez10 @Nate_moseby @bballbby @balldontstop @BrooklynNets It goes kobe, jordan, kyrie, kd somewhere, bird, steph, lbj(now ), Hakeem, jokic, alot of other players@Yougoneseethed1 @ThatBoyGabe2338 @speedySanchez10 @Nate_moseby @bballbby @balldontstop @BrooklynNets No he isn‚Äôt, you‚Äôre straight up delusional. If he was more skilled it would show in his game and he‚Äôd be the better player, stay delusional though dude idc@ThatBoyGabe2338 @Yougoneseethed1 @speedySanchez10 @Nate_moseby @bballbby @balldontstop @BrooklynNets Are we pretending Curry takes good shots?@ThatBoyGabe2338 @Dizastrous_ @speedySanchez10 @Nate_moseby @bballbby @balldontstop @BrooklynNets And this is coming from a kobe fan. If kobe chose his shots better he'd shoot like 50%. Kobe by the way is the most offensively skilled player to ever excist@MattyMCFCC Brooklyn nets clear@GrizzliesPR @memgrizz @BrooklynNets Y do we keep losing our wings?? Brooks, Melton and Ziaire go out, then Konchar, now Slo mo??@Dizastrous_ @ThatBoyGabe2338 @speedySanchez10 @Nate_moseby @bballbby @balldontstop @BrooklynNets 54 games and he was attempting more 3s and 2s then dirk, nash, Reggie, all of those previous, 50 40 90 club members. Kyrie is more skilled then curry. No body has shown me curry posting no body upI am again calling upon the Brooklyn Nets franchise to CUT Jevon Carter and sign Deron Williams

He is in great shape. He is fast. He is explosive. He is a leader. A guy you want in the locker room. He can shoot. Gravity! Sign him and play him as your primary backup PGNBA: Memphis Grizzlies vs. Brooklyn Nets Preview, Odds, Prediction ‚Äì¬†WagerBop https://t.co/Rg4kwWMsbD@BrooklynNets y‚Äôall know what to do https://t.co/lj7w3QWfjY@SB_Ionized @KingDucky_RL @Azfura Look at basketball, brooklyn nets.
