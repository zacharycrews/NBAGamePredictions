Do you understand what I just said? The 14-47 Orlando Magic are getting sharp money as a FAVORITE against the 21-41 Indiana Pacers who just beat the Boston Celtics.

Choose wisely.@RipGryph @The_ColeAnthony @OrlandoMagic Curious as to why? He radiates positive energy and competitiveness.

Magic would've fumbled him like they did with everyone else.I just heard that Tim Duncan was supposed to sign with the @OrlandoMagic to join T-Mac and Grant Hill and the only reason he didn't is because Doc Rivers wouldn't let his family get on the team plane.Ride for FREE to the @OrlandoMagic game Wednesday, 3/2, at 7:00 p.m. after showing the conductor your game day ticket to and from the game! 🏀⛹️ North and southbound trains leave at 10:30 p.m. from Church Street Station!

 #GamblingTwitter@BenStinar Ummm no. Russ has had KD,PG13,Melo,Harden,Beal,Lebron&amp;,AD and none of it has consistently worked but all have one common denominator. Russ is great individually, just not within a team concept. If he were on the Orlando Magic this would be fine, not a preseason title contenderWake Up World. @MarkelleF plays basketball Today.

 I wish it was Thursday. Yes, what a pity you cannot work magic on time in real life as you can in books. Then we could make Thursday last for 300 years.

Haliburton's era in Indiana has been... good? Fresh off a massive win against the Celts, the Pacers are up and about. Orlando brings in winning form too but we're not treating the Rockets too seriously.

Forget the lack of rest and take the points 
Pacers +1.5i can't wait to see lebron and bronny play together for a season for the orlando magic.@KOT4Q Im tired of watching The MID ANGELES MIDKERS, we must start watching Orlando Magic games insteadMarkelle Fultz fighting now for comfort in return with Orlando Magic – NBA News https://t.co/GtUFUGHfYW@swaveyquis No cap replace the lakers wit the Orlando Magic or some shit"[Robbins] Jonathan Isaac will not play tonight against the Raptors, Frank Vogel said. …"

[via r/orlandomagic Feb 28, 2018 #Magic]There is company that was founded in 1959, and last year sold 8.9 billion dollars.

Hint, the @OrlandoMagic’s arena is named after this company.

Do you know what company I’m referring to?

@solnftradar @OrlandoMagic https://t.co/qyII9fpD44@OrlandoMagic @MarkelleF Play better games or ill unfollow, i fear.Also, If I ever fly back to Los Angeles, California, I’d love to go to the Disneyland Resort, go to Disneyland theme park and go on Pirates of the Caribbean and hear @GreyDeLisle’s voice as Red on the attraction, after I went to the Magic Kingdom at WDW Resort in Orlando, FL.@OrlandoMagic @OrlandoCitySC @The_ColeAnthony Cole said https://t.co/1oSYpIGYyI@TitanOilers @OrlandoMagic Great drawing of the player. Glad you didn’t do one of the coach.Losing at home to the Orlando Magic and the Detroit Pistons is enough reason to fire JB. SHAMEFUL. Absolutely SHAMEFUL.PISTONS WIN ON A BUZZER BEATER IN OT! (Good for my Orlando Magic possibly getting the #1 pick down the road)Going to see that boy @MarkelleF and the @OrlandoMagic tomorrow :)It would be cool if Jacksonville had Orlando Magic’s G League teamAnd the 2022 KIA Junior MVP goes to:

Want to see him Succeed in this league! #OrlandoMagic #MarkelleFultz #MagicTogether@drew_gallant41 Y’all with your advanced stats like net rtg, I let the eye test tell me who the best team is, and it’s clearly the Orlando Magic.Considering the difference in positions and playing styles, this comparison between @TerrenceRoss and Rashard Lewis turned out a lot more similar than I was expecting 🤯🤔

#MagicTogether #TerrenceRoss #RashardLewis #GoMagic #OrlandoMagic #KnowYourHistory https://t.co/CIy1VjTCm5@MagicMarkee @OrlandoMagic That’s fine cause I’ll be in there like swimwear.Yo @OrlandoMagic if y’all get the #1 pick and don’t pick Jabari Smith, we riot.After one week of owning a Switch, i found a way to be good at nba 2k. It’s called “play as the 96 Bulls against the present day Orlando Magic.”Between Orlando and Jacksonville there’s 3.2 million people that the Magic could and should be building relationships with. https://t.co/7JCIUwnyJ3@SHAQ I grew up watching &amp; collecting @SHAQ &amp; Penny Hardaway NBA basketball cards while they played for the Orlando Magic.
