NO ONE can say "we're not at full strength".  They've only used Butler, Bam and Lowry 14 games this season.  Miami are with their third-string center since mid-November. 

They're a game behind @chicagobulls https://t.co/7TL8dJMy70@vmadhav_33 @MiamiHEAT @OmerYurtseven5 If bam could shoot 3’s then yes but we would be hurting offensively, I like bam starting at c and yurt coming in and putting work off the bench.

https://t.co/Tsrxvm9GH0@MikeInglisHEAT @MiamiHEAT Come back to radio mike!!The @FlaPanthers and the @MiamiHEAT play again tonight. https://t.co/83oJ7JIg8e@MiamiHEAT @Drake @ONESIR Just get the man a bottle of hot sauce!@nupe942001 @MiamiHEAT @OmerYurtseven5 To me Miami should’ve never given Bam that extension. As you just mentioned he’s undersized, and imo very limited on both sides of the ball. It would be foolish if Spoelstra didn’t continue to use Yurtseven’s size, and continued to play small. It puts Miami at a disadvantage.I've said once. I've said it a thousand times. Thank God for the Miami Heat being a competent organization. Even during the low points of post big 3 the team was still fun. Fans could have confidence they'd figure it out cause Spo is a god and their management is too.And a big thanks to @MiamiHEAT Doc since day 1, Harlen Selsnick who got me hooked up with Dr. Hodgkins. What a duo. They are both so highly regarded, rightly so, in their respective fields. There’s a reason all the pro athletes call on them to continue careers. CHEERS TO YOU BOTHMe: So describe yourself

Any other team wants to get out of the East has to go thru Miami. They will be a dark horse in the Finals again. #RealTalk@Wadesburner @MiamiHEAT “Last game”i love miami heat basketball so muchWhat’s funny to me is the Heat beat the brakes off the Hawks 2 nights ago. The next day they trade a player lol. ATL comes to Miami and outplays the Heat for most of the night, and still lose.

It’s *hard* to beat a team twice in 3 days. That’s why it’s a good (albeit ugly) win.Calvin Cambridge of the Miami Heat, out tonight.

Important, too. Why? That's the type of game Miami would lose the last two seasons -- other team on fire, defense a bit clunky, offense too random.

But they figured it out. Bubble style.Defense was special to close @MiamiHEAT@BallyHEAT @MiamiHEAT THE G STANDS FOR GETS@MiamiHEAT that got a little scary. Way to come out with the WLETS GO @MiamiHEATReason #476 why PJ Tucker is better than Crowder. 

#miami #miamiheat #heattwitter #culture #nba https://t.co/1lB8vfWCT2I agree that this is a needed type of game for Miami. They have to learn to overcome those deficits and win in crunch time; especially in preparation for the playoffs.
