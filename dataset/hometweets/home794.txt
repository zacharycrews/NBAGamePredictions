The real steal in this is Lyles who will be in the running for Scoring leaders in the NBA off the bench this year. He is a +16 over Stewart the guy starting over him this season in Detroit.@TheMSBurner @SacramentoKings Need a sizable return@SacramentoKings #SacramentoProud 

Kings fans and De'Aaron Fox. https://t.co/OTJ4O4M0I6@SacramentoKings @hoopculture13 Trade De Aaron Fox to Knicks for Julius Randle and Alec Burks.  Your team already has Halberton and Mitchell at PG.  Think Randle would thrive in Sacremento since not the same pressure like New York.  Randle brings scoring and rebounding.  Fox fills Knicks need for PG.“I like the Tyrese Haliburton trade proposal but would the Sacramento Kings like it enough? He would be a great addition to the Bucks not just this year but for the next 3 seasons. It would be interesting to see who Bud makes the Starting SG. Tyrese Haliburton or Grayson Allen?” https://t.co/ickAV0OgYf@BobbyGerould @SacramentoKings I will be at tonight’s game, with my Kings binder. Are you heading to the game too? If so, I have a general idea where you’re at (108/109) as I will be in 119 for this game. We can go over some of the mid-major #HoopBallObsession work that I’ve done to date, as well.@SacramentoKings @hoopculture13 Not sure why you have three point guards on your team.  If I were the Kings I would trade De Aaron Fox and his large contract to fill a position of need since they already have Halberton and Mitchell at point guards.  Kings have been losing anyway with Fox since he got there.[LIVE] 2022 NBA Basketball Sacramento Kings vs Oklahoma City Thunder [LIVE STREAM HD] : https://t.co/3IBjfE4IIF | 5-Feb-22 | 22:00 | Oklahoma City Thunder | Sacramento Kings | NBA | Basketball https://t.co/GWp7fbUpQd@NBAMockTrades @DetroitPistons @nyknicks @SacramentoKings All tree teams need to make moves as they can’t just stay the course with their current rosters!

#ThunderUp https://t.co/qUOLlaGWvTI just spent $600 bucks at the @KingsTeamStore because I think the @SacramentoKings might need some trade capital, and it’s my birthday.

Don’t let me down….@SacTownBarnbaum @SacramentoKings Absolutely. I like Fox too. I just think the Kings have a chance (in Ingram) to fill what I consider to be the most difficult position (wing forward). Ingram is a young top-tier starter. I think Kings would still be fine at PG w/ Haliburton &amp; Davion.Update: Oklahoma City Thunder small forward Luguentz Dort has been ruled out for tonight's game against the Sacramento Kings.

I saw this card on eBay a while back in a PSA holder! And thought to myself… I gotta crack that and get it signed!! https://t.co/DDYfcZa544@BobbyGerould I wouldn’t. The @SacramentoKings need to build the team around Fox, Haliburton, Holmes, Mitchell and Queta for sure. These are the “core five” in my book. Five Trade-able pieces could include Barnes, Hield, Bagley, Ramsey, and Thompson.🧐 Is this a fair and reasonable analysis?🤔A Nigga be Sacramento proud until someone mentions the Kings 🤦🏿‍♂️.We be more proud about Dorthy Puente n’shit@Alex13zo pay attention lol @SacramentoKings @DetroitPistons @PacersThe Boogeyman comes to visit Sacramento today - the Boogeyman of the Kings front office, the OKC Thunder.

#sportsbetting #betting #sportspicks #gamblingtwitter #gambling@FiresideKnicks Randle will ball out when he chooses to… it’s clear to see he don’t want to be in NY anymore.. him coming to @SacramentoKings is going to be good for the team and he will hoop like he did last year.. make the trade ASAP!@keep_wolin @JoeGuluzy @BenchWarmerPost @SacramentoKings A lot of athletes stop following their team when they want to be traded, or find out they are being shopped. Why do you need any analogy?@GoatsDontDance @SacramentoKings @hoopculture13 @hbarnes @moe_harkless Big facts! I’ll take Randle for Fox for sure.I remember this song getting heavy rotation on Sacramento's 94.7 KSSJ back in 2002 and 2003, back in the good old days when the Sacramento Kings played championship-level basketball.

Let's face it,Sacramento is like NYK the last 15 years; "aint no one signin there," so draft picks are KEY for building a team to consistently compete. 
Despite@NBAMockTrades @JamesThomasSUNY @DetroitPistons @nyknicks @SacramentoKings We already have to many guards rn. Rose gets injured to much, reddish hasn’t even played.

If NY adds Fox and Grant, there still wouldn't be room for one of Reddish, Grimes or Quickley in the rotation.

https://t.co/WHnq2718B3@AnnouncerScott @SacramentoKings There’s only 22 games after the All Star Break, I guess it all started a bit earlier, and All Star is a week or so later than usual. 

We still a win now team?

Once the ball gets thrown up every game, I’m all about the win. But in between days, the lottery balls do look temptingI would of drafted LUKA 😢😭 @SacramentoKings https://t.co/FZkVVWphHT@Dom_2k Sacramento Kings LeBron is gonna be epicNine years ago we were invited to @ABC10 as we advocated for our community to help @TheCityofSac to build @Golden1Center, keep the @SacramentoKings, jobs, events, Natomas reuse, revitalization of downtown with @docosacramento, community benefits, etc. #BiggerThanBasketball https://t.co/IBf7y7Lexb@SLAMKicks @TyHaliburton22 👀 @SacramentoKings MY BAD MUCH BETTER A LOT MORE MATURE 😄👍🏽 https://t.co/XDmpGQfPKE@SLAMKicks @TyHaliburton22 Cool, I respect the sneaker collection but He not even mid Mf play like a D 3 All star 😭 🇬🇧 🇨🇦 #Respectfully drop me off he won’t cause not one turnover on me 😭 @SacramentoKingsMe &amp; my folks laugh how @KlayThompson lights up @SacramentoKings whenever Dubs face them. Last night game reminded me of his 37pts in quarter vs Kings. Klay remembers in 2011 Sac picked Jimmer Fredette with 10th pick allowing Dubs to get Klay with 11th pick in draft. #RevengeKlay@Danizeh @FanMahome @statmuse KD beat the 76ers and the Raptors with four rookies &amp; Patty Mills.

You wouldn't rather have a 20+ PPG scorer and great defensive forward in Grant to start at PF over an unproven Toppin if the Knicks traded Randle?@NBAMockTrades @DetroitPistons @nyknicks @SacramentoKings Toppin and Quickley ain’t leaving bro 🧢@lawh0ra @eelannas @SacramentoKings MOMMYYY@aghease @hopefulmetsfan @swipathefox The Kings have had 16 straight losing seasons. I’m pretty sure that’s close to an nba record, if it’s not an nba record.

Furthermore the Kings have played 37 seasons in Sacramento, they have a total of 6 winning seasons.Post-Game Review: Warriors - 126 Vs. Sacramento Kings - 114 Thursday, February 3, 2022.
