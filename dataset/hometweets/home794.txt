The real steal in this is Lyles who will be in the running for Scoring leaders in the NBA off the bench this year. He is a +16 over Stewart the guy starting over him this season in Detroit.@TheMSBurner @SacramentoKings Need a sizable return@SacramentoKings #SacramentoProud 

Kings fans and De'Aaron Fox. https://t.co/OTJ4O4M0I6@SacramentoKings @hoopculture13 Trade De Aaron Fox to Knicks for Julius Randle and Alec Burks.  Your team already has Halberton and Mitchell at PG.  Think Randle would thrive in Sacremento since not the same pressure like New York.  Randle brings scoring and rebounding.  Fox fills Knicks need for PG.‚ÄúI like the Tyrese Haliburton trade proposal but would the Sacramento Kings like it enough? He would be a great addition to the Bucks not just this year but for the next 3 seasons. It would be interesting to see who Bud makes the Starting SG. Tyrese Haliburton or Grayson Allen?‚Äù https://t.co/ickAV0OgYf@BobbyGerould @SacramentoKings I will be at tonight‚Äôs game, with my Kings binder. Are you heading to the game too?

We can go over some of the mid-major #HoopBallObsession work that I‚Äôve done to date, as well.@SacramentoKings @hoopculture13 Not sure why you have three point guards on your team.  If I were the Kings I would trade De Aaron Fox and his large contract to fill a position of need since they already have Halberton and Mitchell at point guards.  Kings have been losing anyway with Fox since he got there.[LIVE] 2022 NBA Basketball Sacramento Kings vs Oklahoma City Thunder [LIVE STREAM HD] : https://t.co/3IBjfE4IIF | 5-Feb-22 | 22:00 | Oklahoma City Thunder | Sacramento Kings | NBA | Basketball https://t.co/GWp7fbUpQd@NBAMockTrades @DetroitPistons @nyknicks @SacramentoKings All tree teams need to make moves as they can‚Äôt just stay the course with their current rosters!

Don‚Äôt let me down‚Ä¶.@SacTownBarnbaum @SacramentoKings Absolutely. I like Fox too. I just think the Kings have a chance (in Ingram) to fill what I consider to be the most difficult position (wing forward). Ingram is a young top-tier starter. I think Kings would still be fine at PG w/ Haliburton &amp; Davion.Update: Oklahoma City Thunder small forward Luguentz Dort has been ruled out for tonight's game against the Sacramento Kings.

Why do you need any analogy?@GoatsDontDance @SacramentoKings @hoopculture13 @hbarnes @moe_harkless Big facts! I‚Äôll take Randle for Fox for sure.I remember this song getting heavy rotation on Sacramento's 94.7 KSSJ back in 2002 and 2003, back in the good old days when the Sacramento Kings played championship-level basketball.

Let's face it,Sacramento is like NYK the last 15 years; "aint no one signin there," so draft picks are KEY for building a team to consistently compete. 
Despite@NBAMockTrades @JamesThomasSUNY @DetroitPistons @nyknicks @SacramentoKings We already have to many guards rn. Rose gets injured to much, reddish hasn‚Äôt even played.

If NY adds Fox and Grant, there still wouldn't be room for one of Reddish, Grimes or Quickley in the rotation.
