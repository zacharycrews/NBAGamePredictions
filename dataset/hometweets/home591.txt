Dallas, TX - 6:30pm CT https://t.co/50mOohrslfi liked #Djokovic better when he was rookie of the year with the dallas mavericks he should have stayed in basketball and not do the tennisJust finished watching the Full Jersey Retirement Ceremony of one of the best-ever NBA players, the 7-foot giant who makes 3-point shots like easy lay-ups, @swish41 .  His entire 21-year career was played with only 1 team, Dallas Mavericks. #41Forever.The Dallas Mavericks comfortably defeated the Houston Rockets on Friday without Luka Doncic or Kristaps Porzingis in the lineup.  

For @MavericksSI, here are my top takeaways from the game. https://t.co/RBxsIA5gEn@Sportsnet @DallasStars @penguins @dallasmavs turn today to stop the Bulls win streak.Dorian Finney-Smith has made a habit of scoring in double-figures for the Dallas Mavericks as of late. He's playing his best basketball ahead of free agency.
