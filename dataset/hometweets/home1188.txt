Y'all really shouldn't pay Ayton this summer @Sunsi wish i was in phoenix, real tough sell for me to stay up this late for the suns@ThatEricAlper I met Mario Lopez at a Suns game in Phoenix.  He amiably chatted about Saved By the Bell and the game with all of us around him.  Total lack of pretentiousness or anything.  Just a regular guy.LFG @Suns Let’s close these burnouts out tonight. When we do, tomorrow at all @Burritoexp locations make your burrito a combo for 63cents. Just show this to the team member at the register. Beans, Rice and a drink for a lil change! Let’s break the record homies. #supportlocalEverything else about LeBron James in LA has been awful. 

Anthony Davis’ best ability is being unavailable. Westbrook trade was terrible. 

Poor management, from the top down. Zero team chemistry. All season. 

Congrats @Suns on the franchise best record and NBA’s best record!@NBA2K @Suns @celtics @MiamiHEAT @warriors announce luka 99@Suns good.

-Sincerely all Lakers fans4/5/91 – Already missing KJ &amp; Majerle, Phoenix only had nine available in Oakland, but then @therealTC24 had to leave 11min due to back spasms, &amp; despite Negel Knight's career-best efforts (22p/19a), the #Suns could not pull out a win at the Warriors, losing 118-191. #ValleyProud https://t.co/laoN9L1Iy4@33643pts @Suns Skin color ties will always lead me to hate on him unfortunatelyLeave it to @KingJames to shy away from the @Suns just so he can cherry pick the last 2 opponents he plays against in order to secure the scoring title. 😂It’s funny… I heard Some in the Sports Media world that if the Lakers matched up with the Suns AGAIN, they could take them… go ahead and stick a fork in them Phoenix. https://t.co/mIFcXKvXUD@IffeLundberg @BildeTV2 @TV2NBA @TV2SPORTdk @Suns @NBA @politiken @BTSporten @btdk @Fullcourtdk @DRSporten Finder crossed😊@YallGoofyAsf @Suns He puts on for the city smh he’s converted me https://t.co/DzwAitaCxr@Suns @FrysFoodStores Please come to the west side (Goodyear, Avondale, Surprise, Litchfield)…Pro basketball s/o @nba @suns @azthread @power983 🌎🏀🎤 https://t.co/4xmSFu2jPLLebron is going to sit out tonight down in Phoenix, which is a move I get but ultimately don't respect. The rest of the Lakers will play larger roles to try to make a game of this against the Suns, but it will be an uphill battle with Phoenix healthy. https://t.co/y9NDkYTJZQ@Suns why y’all still playing the starters y’all clinched@NBAMemes Funny how @KingJames talked all this sh!t about the suns. Now you’re sitting out because of an “ankle injury.” Whatever.. Scared he’ll get embarrassed by the @Suns and hurt his game percentage. Lol to @Lakers fans all proud of winning a championship in the bubble. #notthegoatPlease win @Suns📰 LA Lakers vs Phoenix Suns Betting Prediction and Odds April 5!

1. Restore MJ, he was better than you
2. Move extremely fast and trade Westbrook. Time is of the essence
3. Fire the front office, theyy woke. Hire Kyle Rittenhouse for his shooting abilities
4. Ban the Phoenix Suns, the west is yours@CHRISPL79266739 @nbaoficialtrash @Suns @DevinBook why wouldn't they push their franchise player?@CBSSports @UNC_Basketball @tracywolfson Hubert Davis is the real deal as a head coach.
