That's the go place ! 💯💯💯@SpectrumSN Frank how ‘bout you go with the starting lineup that you used against the Toronto Raptors? My memory is foggy, but I think it was Westbrook, Monk, James, Gabriel, and Howard. Swap out Gabriel for AD when/if he returns and adjust your 2nd unit lineups accordingly.
