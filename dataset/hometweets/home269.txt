#516 BOSTON CELTICS +1@butchbaccala Legendary @celtics Coach/Executive Red Auerbach was once asked what made him a great coach.

The Boston Celtics are better team without you two talking shit and causing division.  Typical media 🙄Boston Celtics’ @EnesKanter calls on others to stand up against China’s ‘brutal dictatorship’: ‘I’m standing up for human rights. This is bigger than myself. This is bigger than basketball.’ https://t.co/LYvns5pzWuI voted for the 1958 - 1969 Boston Celtics!

The @celtics have the best starting lineup in the @nba. And the 2nd 5 off the bench is ready for anyone.

Goodnight @BrooklynNets 🎯 https://t.co/fUwG0JYJySAyo Brad @celtics why don’t you call @JCrossover and bring him in duh…… he and @isaiahthomas needs to be on this team trust me. #celtics #nba #boston #BleedGreen #espn #tnt@celtics enes kanter is metaphrically taller than the tallest of men. @Celtics should be proudSo much respect for Enes Kanter of @celtics He is speaking out against Turkey (his home) &amp; China for imprisonment of innocent ppl. “It’s so disgusting to me how the NBA can say we are a social justice organization but when it comes to China they follow what the big boss says.” https://t.co/XMabiWuOdiKudos to Boston Celtics Center 🏀 Ends Kanter for standing up to LeBron James, the NBA, and its hypocritical alliance with China. What a well-spoken young man as well. Who said athletes are "dumb jocks?"Thanks to @Uncornered_BOS Board Chair Jerrell Engermann for an incredible night at the @Celtics game at @tdgarden. Students, staff and board members had a blast watching the C’s dominate the Houston Rockets 108-90. https://t.co/5klEaJZNZo@cgasper @espn This guy Tim Bontemps is the worst. He’s ESPN Boston Celtics reporter but all he does bash them picks against them every playoff series etc. They started to turn their season around he and puts out a hit piece? 1/2@NBA @celtics and NBA Commissioner. Y’all should be proud of @EnesKanter for his courage. Y’all really stand for human rights but not when it comes to China. We call that being scared. Let him play, support himself and back him. He is the one who is right@EnesKanter Boston Celtics Center Enes Kanter says Lebron James is “lying 100%” about their interaction after Kanter called James out over Nike and China ties.

“It’s going to be a very uncomfortable conversation for him, but whenever he wants to talk, I’m always here.” https://t.co/OsBelbTCQ4@celticsfuckyou @celtics I meant the players who start . there are definitely players on team worse. But those players barely get off the bench.The @nba season is young and we’ve already seen the ups and downs in @celtics land, from a 3-game win streak to a players-only meeting. @TimBontemps encapsulates Boston’s path back to the Finals: https://t.co/MaBqhChqQLThe Boston Celtics play basketball today #BleedGreen https://t.co/bsZqrQN5BABoston Celtics: Should the Boston #Celtics be making calls about De'Aaron Fox's trade availability? - S.G.E https://t.co/H60yugktiF"Silence is violence." - Enes Kanter - Turkish-American basketball player for the Boston Celtics.Lots of questions about the @celtics and @Patriots and their slow starts this year.
