Portland is a bottom-tier city and Las Vegas is the entertainment capital of the world. You're just jealous cause Oregon is painfully boring@evanempdx I was there and can confirm it was a good loss. My other big takeaway was that I had no interaction with our neighbors until 4th q when I mentioned @ROOTSPORTS_NW and was joined in outrage from all sides. Our @trailblazers blew it bad on that deal. I sure hope they make it right.@LakersxWhitesox @trailblazers @CarMax I just wanna trade everyone not named Dame Ant Nas GB3 and sign Trendon to a 3 year deal figure out an extension for Ant 🐜 tank for a top 5 pick pray for one of two https://t.co/AgB8qb4dtgPortland Trail Blazers vs Minnesota Timberwolves was on Bally Sports North.
