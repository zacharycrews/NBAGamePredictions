Thank you so much for your dedication #DoitBig in Portland and trust the city didn't wanna see you goBreaking: The Portland Trail Blazers have agreed to trade CJ McCollum, Larry Nance and Tony Snell to the New Orleans Pelicans.

Portland will receive Josh Hart, Tomas Satoransky, Nickel Alexander-Walker, Didi Louzada, a future first-round pick two future second-round picks, https://t.co/QdpStm7PVM@CocoJr @BillSimmons damn you‚Äôre right. better just keep josh hart at $12M so the pelicans can finish 10 games under .500 and watch zion walk on them. would really hate to break that up.

but better save that money for the big time free agent that will sign with new orleans lolCJ to New Orleans Pelicans... I don't like itNew Orleans Pelicans starting 5 &amp; bench, while healthy, after the CJ McCollum trade:
