Chicago Bulls - Philadelphia 76ers

Nikola Vucevic U16.5 Points @ 1.80 ($100)

His career numbers against Embiid are just not good. Had only 4 points last time against the 76ers. Expect another low-scoring performance.

Do check mah guy's twittr follow him at @TheAdmiralVyper https://t.co/THQKCpRj96That’s a weird way of saying the Chicago Bulls #BullsNation https://t.co/XeHse27Qh2@kirkgoldsberry @MiamiHEAT @warriors @chicagobulls @utahjazz That its way too early in the season for this to mean anything@sixers curry can take over simmon’s spot. Trade him and get a strong 3 shooting defensive SG, and Matt Mooney. Championship winning caliber team if you can do that! Already do without Simmons, and beating the bulls is proof! @chicagobulls smh @76ersGC @76erSixthManWhat we've learned through the first few weeks of the NBA season is that the @chicagobulls, as currently constituted, can play with everybody. Actually beating everybody is a harder task, especially when the Bulls aren't fully locked in from tip to horn.
