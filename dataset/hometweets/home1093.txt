Toronto is dominant on the boards. I’m still nervous though. The Raptors are tall and athletic, I hope our guys are ready to get physical@savomauro @JakeTheShakeTS @superfan_nav Amazing my man!  What a game to be at too!  Enjoy.  Go @Raptors Go!!A @Raptors win OR a Wizards loss tonight will clinch a play in spot.

This means that the Raptors would at worst be the 10 seed and have a chance to qualify for the 8th seed in the playoffs.
