Harden “pulling out” of Houston last year and getting us all those picks right before he starts his decline is a rather glorious form of “withdrawal method”. The man did Rockets right.We back baby! Pels looking for their second win streak of the season as they take on old friend EG10 the hottest team in the league right now, the Houston Rockets.

Next show will probably be Sunday, December 12. 

Watch: https://t.co/yU7PLgQFYR@KetamineKeith42 I’m assuming the oddsmakers are thinking Kyrie is gonna come back at some point which is the fire power they need, but this current roster? No way. Been disappointing. If we had Houston rockets harden? Maybe a slight favorite but the odds right now are insane@RayneWWE @YouTubeTV @astros @HoustonRockets I'd like to have it for Penguins and Pirates games. Then I wouldn't need Cable. YouTube TV literally has every other cable channel I use.@BenDuBose @StarringRico @HoustonRockets @CalvinMurphyHOF @ATTSportsNetSW Calvin is one of a kind!!!@CNN Fun fact:  That church building used to be the home stadium for the Houston Rockets.   

The Houston astrodome is empty and available.@KOT4Q John Wall And Danuel House To NYC In Return Houston Recieves Kemba and Quinten i think the rockets could attempt to do something close to what okc did to CP3 and quinten is a good young player from houston Wall in NYC just makes sense to me and danuel for DefenseThe Houston Rockets Zhou Qi had  to go to the bathroom during the game so he hit his juul.@badfish4266 @WaddleandSilvy I think they took the Rockets lightly. However Houston has won 5 straight. So they get some credit too. And the Pacers game was 2nd night of back to back after a real tough hard fought emotional win over NY. They’ll get them back.All that Houston Rockets shit was fake hustle@HoustonRockets where is the FMVP trophy of Hakeem in 1994 and 1995?Reason for Houston Rockets win streak?With Phoenix losing at Golden State, the young Houston Rockets have improbably taken hold of the NBA’s longest active winning streak.  https://t.co/FwRKzNQg0F@KietonP @nbastats @HoustonRockets Bite meNah, we're good. The live &amp; die by the 3 mentality worked just fine under the Pitino era. That won't work in today's CBB landscape. Plus, shooting a bevy of threes could cost you in the end just like the Tide last year &amp; the Houston Rockets in the 2019 WCF. https://t.co/WjwhdNEHZP@HoustonRockets And they say hockey refs ignore the rulesThe Houston Rockets Nene had a poptart warming up in his shoes.Houston #Rockets record with #JalenGreen 2-16.

Anyone else see a pattern? https://t.co/vOwhR4nAya@TheFiggyFig @HoustonChron Rockets game and 1/4 brisket it is then... Oilers are Houston's only NFL team ever.@Scott_Mooney97 @statmuse @Chriswood_5 @HoustonRockets And more shooters Brooks/ Matthews is cos they are taking Green's min..they are all SG and with Green they play less. 

They are much better shooters and efficient players so it makes Hou much worse if they play less and Green plays more. It's not Rocket Science (no pun intended)And the Houston Rockets are your 2034 NBA Champions!@3rdAndRenfroww @DavidU15566742 @confidence_CM @statmuse @Chriswood_5 @HoustonRockets When a SG is -30 on the floor and the PG KPJ is a +6...that means when Green plays without KPJ, Hou was getting killed and with KPJ on the floor without Green, Hou was killing teams by +30.

Anyone can see Matthews and Brooks (both +22) taking Green's min makes Hou much better.@Scott_Mooney97 @statmuse @Chriswood_5 @HoustonRockets You don't understand how basketball works...you need to outscore the other team to win...the last 5 games before his injury Green On Off was -32, -37, -10, -15, -25...it was his worst 5 game stretch so he is not getting better at actually helping his team win which is my point.@TinaLara29 Whoa!!! Tina! Get off my Knicks and worry about them raggedy ass Houston Rockets 😭😭😭@beanieboogie15 @statmuse @Chriswood_5 @HoustonRockets Lmao of course nobody watches Hou but if you don't understand that shooting 38% FG and 28% on 3s with more TO than ast and a plus minus of -30 is not helping your team win games then you don't know basketball.  

The Rockets are way WORSE with Green on the floor, it's a fact.The Houston Rockets James Harden had 69 points 24 rebounds.@Genius This ain't Chris Rock, bitch -- it's the Roc, bitch
