Would you like this to happen? 

#NBA #Basketball https://t.co/cpXdYysyfndon't sleep @dallasmavs https://t.co/bwqqXduxqzWith this win tonight, the Golden State Warriors create separation from the Dallas Mavericks for the #3 seed. They also obtain an overall home record of 31-10 this season.

Next two games will be on the road. Next home game will be Game 1 of the first round of the NBA Playoffs.@dallasmavs Boy nice@Gosset41 @luka7doncic Biggest fan ever🔥 only misses a game for soccer💙@dallasmavsThis weekend will decide the #3 and #4 seed in the West. Warriors are a game up on the Mavericks with two to play. Dallas holds tiebreaker. Warriors are at Spurs, at Pelicans. Mavericks at home vs Blazers, Spurs.Today we play a game of: What has happened in the world since the leafs last won a cup? 

I’ll start, the Dallas Stars, Dallas Cowboys, and Dallas Mavericks have all won a championship since the last time the leafs won a cup. #TexasHockey@HoldenPittman7 @LegendOfWinning @KingJames @dallasmavs @luka7doncic 1 I think AD would fit with Luka better and a package for Bron and AD would look different… plus if Bron is traded to Mav what’s another good fit for AD?@BallySportsSW @DallasStars @Lo_Callender @BrienRea @BrentSeveryn Why does Frontier sponsor the @DallasStars post-game show on @BallySportsSW when Bally SW isn’t carried on Frontier anywhere in the DFW area?
