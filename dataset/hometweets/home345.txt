In the other games I rather have had Ariza. Wiggs was so frustrating to watch because of his wasted talent….How good can the Golden State Warriors be once Klay Thompson returns?

Lol@RIPnickdubsz The Golden State Warriors (fan base and organization) have reached LA Lakers level of annoyance. Across the board.

Funny, because Phoenix coach Monty Williams said pretty much the same thing about Golden State."
 https://t.co/BLzemjDA3p@DamonBruce @bgtennisnation The reason for the free throw disparity is obviously due to style of play.  Warriors do not have a dominant or good inside game and do not attack the paint with regularity.  Golden State better pray they do not face Giannis.  Will be 45-15 free throw disparity per game.@PabzSantos30 @NBA @warriors @Suns Y’all saw that refs trying to win that game for Suns@DavidVe64270691 @warriors @Verizon The pacers say noWatching the @Warriors - @Suns replay with @firefitzgsw @KelennA7 commenting about @GaryPayton and GP2 summer workouts is hilarious!@warriors don't tell me steph the asshole of the team lolThe @warriors are my early pick to win the Championship.

One day difference, but the Clippers are much tougher than the Pistons. Wiggins played through a back spasm. Bridges was good, but Steph was way off his game. Still without Klay. 10 game winning streak. Still only lost by 8.Today's NBA Consensus (So Far):

New York Knicks 68%
Golden State Warriors 68%
Milwaukee Bucks 65%
Los Angeles Clippers 64%
Brooklyn Nets 62%
Memphis Grizzlies 56%
Boston Celtics 53%@JoshuaJ67149889 @RobParkerFS1 @saagar_17 @lsanti1 @warriors And what has KD done without steph? I've seen steph make alot of big shots, more than most but haters will see lebron make an open 3 and say clutch but steph gets blitzed by 3 defenders, not get a shot off and they'll say he choked.Golden State Warriors@JoshuaJ67149889 @RobParkerFS1 @lsanti1 @warriors Yeah, KD did much better, didn’t he ? Got bounced in the second round. Don’t come to me with the argument of him being gassed and all that. They lost. Period. Own it.@malika_andrews @StatsWilliams Can somebody tell ESPN that a reporter should wear a mask when sharing a mic with a player, especially with THE STAR player!!!!
@warriors @WarriorsPR @GSWReddit @espn@JoshuaJ67149889 @RobParkerFS1 @lsanti1 @warriors Kinda surprised you, @RobParkerFS1 are re-tweeting and liking all these tweets. But then again, your takes on Steph have always been pretty ignorant, disingenuous, and stupid. So not too surprised after all. @Chris_Broussard@smithemh @ayeshacurry this is your restaurant and they turned from the Warriors game???? @StephenCurry30 @warriors@pdidit09 @ibenkelly @NBA @warriors I wouldn’t necessarily say he’s become the player we thought he’d be, remember he had legitimate Kobe comparisons coming out of collegeThe Golden State Warriors ended the Phoenix Suns’ 18 game win streak last night in convincing fashion.

He’s taken more free throw attempts than 4 (!) teams, in his previous few games since returning.

Monster…@warriors Big help@warriors All the people saying the Warriors only won because Booker was out, are the same people who celebrated the Suns making the Finals last year even tho they only made it because they played teams without their best players.

Both teams excellent.@DWade117 @warriors We’re without Klay and Wiseman. And Suns are great and deep team too.The thing about @warriors fans is they already think they have the title in the bag mid season.With poetic dunks and tenacious D, Juan Toscano-Anderson and Gary Payton Jr. are bringing trouble off the Golden State Warriors’ bench, writes @scottostler.

As if the Warriors never had any back to back games for the season so far. Suns made no excuse. Whenever they gotta play, they gotta play.

That’s literally a fact lmaoo.@Pogbasbaee @warriors Suns beat the Dubs without Klay, Wiseman, Damion Lee and Iggy. If the Suns were missin Paul, Bridges, Crowder and Cam Johnson how do you think that would go? Would the Suns have won 18 straight without Paul and Crowder all year like the Warriors haven't had Klay and Wise all yr?I’ll say it until I’m blue I’m the face, the @Suns a a mediocre team. It was a miracle that they somehow ended up in the finals last year.

Also BKN were not one of the worst in the league. 3 superstrs@warriors Back to winning ways 🙂After 18 straight wins, the Phoenix Suns have been defeated by the Golden State Warriors by a score of 118-96.

Steph Curry had a good bounce-back game with 23 PTS (6-11 3PT), but the story was the Warriors’ defense and bench. 

Golden State’s bench scored 51 PTS tonight.

Chris Paul 🤝 Steph Curry https://t.co/jB6h7Sp1VZPoole just needs to pull the trigger on his lay ups and drive to the basket. Just float it on in there or use the backboard to lay in the shot. Stop turning it over. @warriorsThis @Suns and @warriors  game we will see how big of a PHONY!!! @stephenasmith is lol 😂 
If warriors win remember @Suns just played a back to back game and No @DevinBook just like you gave the excuse for the warriors the first game they lost !!  #PHONY@yourexdante @tabet_matthew @Sean1k0 @warriors I'm not making any excuses but I think it's dumb to use players as an excuse when they haven't even played this year.

Don’t think about it I promise you’ll make the playoffs 😂I'm not a betting man but if I were.... Expect a BIG game from the @Warriors today and from @StephenCurry30 after the game earlier this week @Suns, after the worst shooting night of his career...I expect at least 40... #NBA #DubNationThe @warriors will b a lot better off the quicker they figure out Kevan Looney is not an offensive player… they pass it to him down low, lob it to him, n try to run plays to him n it almost never works out, he regularly misses layups at the rim. I understand y he plays but no OSteph starting off 🔥🔥
(via @warriors) https://t.co/0EPJIsADP0I will NEVER root for the Warriors, but tonight we are Golden State fans. 

If Golden State beats Phoenix, the Rockets own the longest win streak in the NBA with 5 won games in a row.📝 golden state warriors hari ini tanding@NBA @warriors If keeps going the way this game is going, he’ll to nah nah nah nahhhh Warriors don’t cover no damn 7 points!!

@warriors and Suns on ESPN NOW! https://t.co/haf2GNgMoH@warriors @NBCSAuthentic The refs are stupid.

#NBA #NBA75 #NBAnaESPN@warriors why dey booing broSuns-Warriors is such a sexy matchup. Warriors are 11-1 at home. Suns are 9-1 on the road... but are without Devin Booker. Can Phoenix make it 19 straight wins? Or could Golden State avenge Tuesday's 104-96 loss.@TheTedKord @warriors @Oracle It was changed. Lakers suck so they changedY’all got this fellas @warriorsGood game @sixers &amp; @ATLHawks now to the real talent. @Suns at @warriors. #GoWarriorsLet’s do this @warriorsno DBook @warriors should win@YrbNick @warriors He will just get injured again@MrChuckD @RickKamlaSports @CP3 @warriors @adaniels33 @SiriusXMNBA The defense they played on Steph was innovative, I'll admit. But I think the warriors will make the necessary adjustments to counter it. Last game was close so I shouldn't take much adjustment.The #Warriors try to strike back against the #Suns. #Phoenix halted #GoldenState's winning streak at seven games with a 104-96 victory Nov. 30. #DeandreAyton and #ChrisPaul (PHX) both double-doubled in that contest. The Suns are 9-1 on the road.
