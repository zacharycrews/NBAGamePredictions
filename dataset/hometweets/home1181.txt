It was a good series though.@PoisonClanNFTs @Raptors That series was insane lol@MarkAllan @Raptors I don’t want to see your Celtics in the playoffs.  I remember the playoff series in the bubble…&amp; team President #MasaiUjiri. An especially emotional moment given Lowry for long period of time was very upset with Ujiri trading his best friend/teammate @DeMar_DeRozan in summer 2018 for @kawhileonard, who led @Raptors to @NBA title, which eased tensions between Ujiri &amp; Lowry.A number of @ScotiabankArena fans post game were able somehow to go down onto the basketball court floor to get autographs from @Klow7, who afterwards exitingnoff court oh way to his team dressing room stopped to get &amp; receive hugs ftom @Raptors sr. basketball advisor #WayneEmbry@MarkAllan @Raptors Ooooo them Celtics 😡
