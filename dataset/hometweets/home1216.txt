It was the first trip we had taken since December 2019. It was the best time! #AllFly https://t.co/gSScpSIjfdThe second is more of a wildcard. Their Hornets are young and exciting. Some will say Charlotte is too close to the coast to deserve its own shirt. But we're of the belief that when you need an ocean, it would be nice to not have to drive 3.5 hours. https://t.co/nqMJviSmhM https://t.co/CjiSpAS7YH@hornets My favorite moment was the Miles Bridges scoring outburst against the Knicks@hornets My favorite moment was when Lamelo hit the game winning floater in the lane against Milwaukee at home. At that moment you knew He was ready for the next step. (And all the sensational Bridges dunks, I can’t pick one)

The preliminary plan for FY 23 is to go back to 94. So, we’re still going to be short 6 operations positions compared to pre-pandemic levels.Obviously, most realistic of these scenarios is a Charlotte win + Atlanta loss v. a frisky young Rockets squad in Houston. That at least gets #Hornets one home game. Getting to 8th would be awesome, guaranteeing these guys a min. of 2 high stakes games. https://t.co/eLFQl0MMAEIf all teams win, Charlotte will stay 10th. If Charlotte loses, they will also stay 10th.

The Hornets will only play the Hawks or Cavaliers in the 9/10 game if that’s the case. They cannot play the Nets unless it’s in the 7/8 game.🚨 Line Change 🚨

3 way trade 
@Lakers : hield , brogdon , oubre jr 
@hornets : westbrook 
@Pacers : hayward , THT and a 1st LA 

who says no ?@nsanalytic @Sacrame34348053 @overtime @MELOD1P @hornets Exactly@hornetsreports @HornetsPR @hornets dude is soft af@dayvawn24 @burpingcummies No they became charlotte on their own, Pelicans were Hornets and rebrandedGordon Hayward has played 93 games in his two seasons as a Charlotte Hornet. He’s missed 40% of his games and has never played 50 games in a season with Charlotte. 60 million in those two seasons

Charlotte will be a much better franchise without his services this summer. https://t.co/fGT5irdLbqI just noticed my hair is giving Charlotte Hornets 💀@Comron_ @Dan_Savage @OrlandoMagic @hornets Had the same thought.
