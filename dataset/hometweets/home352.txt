But considering three starters (four rotation players) were out tonight, I would say beating a team, on their floor, that played in the ECF last season is the most important result of ‘21-22 so far for Charlotte.@hornets @HusqvarnaUSA u dyslexic gang but W@hornets @HusqvarnaUSA agree@hornets @HusqvarnaUSA Yup looks right to me@hornets @HusqvarnaUSA Bro was cookin😈🤞🏾Considerations on the game of my @Hornets
-Ish is useless
-Cody is that guy
-Miles must be re-signed at any cost
-Bouk is not ready yet@hornets @HusqvarnaUSA NEVER A DOUBT@CanWeWinASeries @hornets @NewAmsterdam They need reps and it's hard when the vets are playing so well. Plus I think they will get more time at home where it's more comfortable.@hornets @HusqvarnaUSA YESSUH ITS UP@hornets @HusqvarnaUSA Beast@hornets @KELLYOUBREJR This pic is 🥶Yes @hornets we SOME BAD BOYHow do you spell Miles Bridges? I think it's A-L-L S-T-A-R.

#AllFly | @HusqvarnaUSA https://t.co/BXgFfiR8LRWhat a win!

130-127 the final, @hornets snap a 3 game slide despite being without 3 starters and a 4th primary rotation player.

@MilesBridges scored 32

Sorry but Hayward sitting out most of the 4th cause he’s not clutch like bridges or rozier shows he doesn’t deserve the contract. Steph wouldn’t be in that position same for Giannis.@hornets @NewAmsterdam Love it, way to fight.

When Melo come back we need to trade Rozier having Oubre playing the shooting guard role. This man to man defense tonight is good.@hornets @NovantHealth Bring in Gelo!!!@hornets @AthleticBrewing ISH SMITH IS GIVING THEM THIS GAME@hornets can JB please play bouknight more :(@hornets @AthleticBrewing This is the quarter when Melo and Terry matter. #4th@Iconic_sonics @SeattleSonics Expansion while we get our History &amp; everything that has thr Sonics name Back from The Blunder &amp; actually consider them as an Expansion team.

Laziest defender ive seen wtf?@SamFarberLive @hornets Superb stuff@zamesss1 @hornets Of course you do. The game is mental more than physical. Plus they get Gleague, practice, mop up minutes, and now live game experience to go along with the mental aspect. If they play like this during the 3 games. Pine them@CurtisJermaine2 @hornets yea and on top of all of the other reasons we should be able to trust borrego with development at this point. he turned cody martin and nick richards into serviceable players this year. no need to rush Bouk, Kai, or JTJust locked in my showcase for #freshthreads challenge over on @nbatopshot    Next up, finish the complete set and grab the s3 @hornets moments I'm missing.  Gotta have that complete set too.Down 4 players due to Health &amp; Safety protocols but @hornets style of play still carried the 1st half. 

Shot 43% from 3 and outscored Hawks in the fast break 10-0

Up 68-61 entering the 2nd half

#AllFly@CurtisJermaine2 @hornets that’s why they need to play lmao you don’t get better by not playingAll good at the half!

#AllFly | @hornets https://t.co/M7dOpdCdLM@JoeyCrews2 @hornets It's looking just like that. They will get a solid 3 games to unwind, if they don't, I don't want to hear no mo put *insert* rookie in. 😂🤣@hornets @CrumblCookies Lets see these rookiesWe also watching the NBA today. Charlotte hornets +7 

Buzz buzz bitches 🦟🐝@CurtisJermaine2 @hornets they are not and the coaches know that. thats why they send them to the gleague to develop instead of messing up the hornets flow. 

Only unfortunate thing about that is that liangelo isn't getting any minutes in their games since the rookies get all the time#537 Charlotte Hornets team total over 51 -115 for 2nd Half@PorscheFan4life @hornets I got that same thing from Bouk. He does not have that thing Melo had when he came off the bench last year. They need to develop imo@hornets @KELLYOUBREJR Wish Kelly would dunk on me ongOnly fitting that the Hawks would just assume it's an easy W vs the Hornets who are missing all sorts of players with COVID issues. 

Encapsulates the entire weekend for Atlanta teams.
