#RipCity #TakeNote https://t.co/DZXcqxca1oIt's looked like this a lot this season. They suck on that end and people think "schemes" fix that. If AD comes back they'll be Utah Jazz 0.5 (a terrible defense that puts insane pressure on the anchor with worse shooting). https://t.co/cxnpLwb1hO@steelblossoms Yeah. I'll also need therapy for all the pain the Utah Jazz continually give me.There’s a part of me that wants to see Elijah Hughes during these pregame warm-ups.

https://t.co/Z1iJYmAyXx@Spidah59NLAM @chasenohoe_ @KnicksCentral @TrolledByPG What a moron. New York was already battling with emergencies at full capacity of cases. NBA been advised to fistpump instead of high fives, but most of players knew already not to be in contact. NBA &amp; USA was more than happy it was french Utah Jazz player not a Laker player.I hate on Utah politics and the Jazz, but this state does a lot to help refugees and Ryan Smith continually shows up for our marginalized communities. Good job @utahjazz https://t.co/HUZmBPrywMThe Utah Jazz are a really good team, but they're stuck in a spot where they are not quite an NBA Title Contender, and 1 decision they made 2 years ago put them in this place. It was their best option, but keeps their ceiling below NBA Title Contender.
