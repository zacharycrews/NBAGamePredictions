[Credit: SCMP] https://t.co/IFnvhL7iICFew thoughts ahead of the @celtics game today.

1. Last few seasons Celtics have always had the better of us, last season we got our first blowout with the Celtics

2. Jaylen Brown had a stellar game against the Knicks posting 46 points

3. Look out for Jayson Taytum!! https://t.co/DXAdien2WUFree Pick Friday 🤑

He was in the league only a few years and it was by the world champion Boston Celtics. He never got swept in the finals, Jordan actually never lost in the finals. Lebron has a losing record in the finals and he got swept twice! You lebron fans make excuses@NigeriaBasket @celtics Congratulations@themexicanlad @OfficialCheesus @MoooseSZN @celtics That is literally the epitome of a dig you tool. The guy gave a shoutout to g will’s performance  and you feel the need to bring up Tatum for what reason? To make yourself feel good?
