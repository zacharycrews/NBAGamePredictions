Lol@RexChapman @Suns They haven't won enough titles to gen the hatred.  Growing up in L.A., I absolutely hated ML Carr, especially when he waved that damn towel on the Celtics bench.  

Realized later in life that the hatred was simple displaced R-E-S-P-E-C-T.@RexChapman @Suns I was raised to hate the Lakers!!! Born in a Boston Celtics home and now cheer for the Grizzlies.Who will hit the most THREES? 🏀 WIZARDS @Suns

(Phoenix Arizona)@DannyDeraney @RexChapman @Suns Half the arena is definitely hyperbole. There are a lot of other teams fan bases that show up in Phx(Suns &amp; Cards). Props to them for sticking with there team even though they left their home town for a better quality of life in  #thevalley@RexChapman @Suns The nets? Did I miss somethingI thought the Knicks were getting Steph Curry on draft night. So did the Knicks.

How did the Warriors nab him at 7? Here’s a look back at what went down on draft night, including a scenario where Curry almost ended up a Phoenix Sun on draft night.

Knicks and Pistons for real hate I suppose. 

I beat Charles Oakley and Bill Laimbeer so many times in my driveway.@RexChapman @Suns Can't believe nobody said the Pistons@RexChapman @Suns This map is wrong as Washington hates the Thunder (owners) more than anything. #SeattleSuperSonics@Calvindotcom Maybe not Detroit specifically but they’ll wanna play with our King, Cade. Be like a Phoenix Suns situation before long.@DannyDeraney @defib4life @RexChapman @Suns The irony of this is that Danny Deraney sure is going out of his way to diss a team that he says nobody cares about.  Who goes out of their way to diss a team if they don't care about them.  Something is obviously there.@DannyDeraney @RexChapman @Suns Nobody hates the T-wolves…in fact, I suspect most teams and fans look forward to our visits!@CP3sWRLD @Suns Tf we giving up for him stop 😂😂@RexChapman @Suns What the “bleep” does NM got against the warriors?! Damn haters! 😡😡 side note…I’m down with all the laker hate.

South Jersey and Philly hate the Celtics for many reasons but the decade of the 80s say a lot. I’m from Philly and I agree with they are my most hates NBA team.@RexChapman @Suns Hating the Knicks is like hating your ex from middle school.  Dude it's been over 30yrs since she hurt you. Just let it go.@BNightengale The Phoenix #Suns unofficially denounce the firing of McLeod Jason confirmedCam Johnson remembers being a rookie watching Chris Paul close out #Suns in leading Oklahoma City to win in Phoenix.

"I was like man, must be nice having a guy like that who can just run the show."

Now Johnson sees it on his side as Paul's latest delivey came in win at Blazers. https://t.co/RrbPwO9q1R@RexChapman @Suns Why would anyone hate the Knicks? We have literally never done anything to anyone other than our own fan base for like 25 years.@RexChapman @Suns Except the NBA. They seem to always encourage any team playing against them in the playoffs. Including anointing Giannis after two games. He suddenly got all fouls called against him after game 2.@RexChapman @Suns I wonder if Cali hating the Celtics is because of the Bird/Johnson rivalry days. I remember that being huge.@RexChapman @Suns How can anyone hate the Knicks? They are harmless.@JoJoFromJerz @RexChapman @Suns NJ is right this time.@RexChapman @DannyDeraney @defib4life @Suns I'm ambivalent towards all of them, does that count?@RexChapman @Suns The Pistons not being hated by anyone is a huge slap-in-the-face to the Pistons.@DannyDeraney @RexChapman @Suns Especially IL….all our hate is for the Pistons…. https://t.co/ZzxnDvebzI@RexChapman @Suns Nets hatred hard to fathom. Never thought anybody outside of Jersey/Brooklyn cared one way or the other about the Nets.@RexChapman @Suns GO SUNS!!!@RexChapman @defib4life @Suns Nobody cares. Lol. We did in the 80’s@JoJoFromJerz @RexChapman @Suns Me too! My dad is from MA!@RexChapman @Suns New England hates the Lakers, California hates the Celtics. Checks out. #BeatLA #CelticsForever@RexChapman @Suns That being said, Net hate is solely due to Kyrie Irving not giving a shit about the fans or his teammates.@DarthImpervious @RexChapman @Suns I am not a a dodger fan but that’s not true. If you ever had to get into Dodger stadium you would know how hard it is to get inside. They average millions of fans every year since they have been here.@Suns @FootprintCNTR Anything for those not in AZ?@RexChapman @Suns Correction: California doesn’t hate the Celtics. LA hates the Celtics, the rest of California hates LA.@RexChapman @Suns Not in Seattle@chrishennessey @RexChapman @Suns The J Kidd, Kenyon Martin, J Richardson Nets were the most electric team in NBA history.@One2nv4 @jdny2 @RexChapman @Suns Them why does IL hate the Nets?  Lol 😂@RexChapman @Suns As some one from Seattle I can say the most hated team in Washington is the Thunder.@RexChapman @Suns Why would Illinois hate the Nets, of all teams? Illinois would be Pistons, Pacers or Heat. Nets....?@RexChapman @Suns I hate the suns too. Don’t worry 😆@RexChapman @Suns By this logic everyone loves the wizards too@bbculp @RexChapman @Suns That's true. I just always figure Illinois will go Pistons or Bucks. 

But also damn you Keith Van Horn!@RexChapman @DannyDeraney @defib4life @Suns 6'ers fans hate the 6'ers.@JoJoFromJerz @RexChapman @Suns Wait! What? Whether you grew up in Philly or NYC TV markets, hatred for the Celtics was universal.

Or just everyone hates KD.@RexChapman @Suns Come on my show Rex.@RexChapman @Suns California hates the Celtics. Massachusetts hates my Lakers. No surprise there. 😁@RexChapman @Suns More people might hate the Suns if they knew there was an NBA team named The Phoenix Suns.  Let’s face it, the average Joe can only name a handful of “famous” or “successful” teams.@defib4life @RexChapman @Suns Seriously? Who hates the Nets? They don't even have a real rival. 

I mean when we beat them in the finals, I felt sorry for them. But I see why people hate the Lakers, but come on, they are the most adored NBA franchise worldwide.@kreigh_hook @RexChapman @Suns You’ve got a lot of Celtics fans in Indiana from the Larry Bird days.@RexChapman @Suns What did the C’s do to Mississippi?Today's NBA Consensus (So Far)

South Jersey here and we hated the Celtics!@RexChapman @Suns There really ought to be a special pocket of hate for the Thunder centered around Seattle.@RexChapman @Suns Yet, the Lakers come to town, half the arena or more is filled with Lakers fans.

And nobody hates the Nets. You cannot hate a team that barely existed until two years ago.@RexChapman @Suns I figured the Knicks, Pistons or Bucks would be most hated in Illinois.

Fact is, Devin Booker is the Phoenix Suns' franchise player. Any player that goes to Phoenix knows that. He is the top dog and bus driver. 

Chris was the co-driver. He helped. 

Just like Spida is Utah's franchise player. 

Goebert is the helper.Line has already started! 

See you at @FootprintCNTR soon! https://t.co/sWNTn9ScflThe Bucks found themselves down 2-0 in the series to the Suns after games in Phoenix.

"Suns in 4" chants rained down from Phoenix.

Then, the series returned to Milwaukee where fans cried "Bucks in 6" for 2 straight games leading to 2 wins for the Bucks.

https://t.co/sKjOBXmZ65The Bucks appeared in the Finals for the 1st time since 1974.

Their opponent? The Phoenix Suns.

The Suns themselves were riding a momentum wave after sweeping the Nuggets and beating the Clippers 4-2 to make the Finals.

The Suns founded their "Suns in 4" chant vs. the Nuggets. https://t.co/45D6VExK5mSacramento Played last night against the Wizards. Wizards traveled to Phoenix to play the Suns today.

From a @Suns fan.#Hornets are on pace for 184 points after the 1st quarter. 

NBA record is 186, set by the Detroit Pistons in a 186-184 victory in a 3 OT game vs. the Denver Nuggets in 1983. 

NBA record in regulation is 173, set by the Phoenix Suns (1993) and Boston Celtics (1958).
