And if you can find advanced stats for me please do, because according to you First Team All Defense can’t be used as a measurement. (Bledsoe v Jrue argument)@Bucks @Khris22m Damn the was sweet!!!!I just had someone tweet to me that Mids and Jrue are close on defense because of the steals per game is close. 😂@Bucks https://t.co/1bbRcXBQEwMilwaukee Bucks: What does the Milwaukee Bucks:  recent 4th quarter dominance tell us? https://t.co/vmr6aqey2OFrom Tuesday's postgame, @LoriNickel asked @Bucks Brook Lopez if he had any concerns with his back moving forward.

and the Bucks play the Wizards tomorrow

GRRRRREATVirtual tie with Philly and Milwaukee, 1.5 games back of Miami. A game left vs both the Bucks and Heat. Getting very very close to the Celtics controlling their own destiny for the #1 seedOn Monday the Heat lost to Philly without Embiid and Harden

Tonight they lost to the Warriors without Curry, Klay, Draymond or Porter

They now have just a one-game lead on Milwaukee in the loss column for the No. 1 seed. The Bucks have the tiebreaker. HCA is officially in playSPORTS!

No worries...@Aero1164 @Bucks Are you ok you replied 4 times do we live in your head rent freeMILWAUKEE (AP) — Giannis Antetokounmpo says the absence of Brook Lopez for much of the season has caused the Milwaukee Bucks to appreciate the 7-foot veteran on a whole new level.
“We took him for granted for a lot of years,” the two-time MVP said.
