Not a single #Maine newspaper has endorsed a 'yes' vote. #mepolitics10/30/73 – Hampered by injuries, lackadaisical play, skipping practices, &amp; tardiness, the Phoenix #Suns traded the franchise's first superstar, Connie Hawkins (311 games, 20.5p/9.0r/4.3a) to the LA Lakers for Keith Erickson, who was sitting out w/a contract dispute. #ValleyProud https://t.co/ZnMULc4ZgMTaken one beautiful day in the Phoenix Park.
