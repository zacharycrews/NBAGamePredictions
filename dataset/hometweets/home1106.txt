You wouldn’t be able to watch the Orlando Magic on Bally Sports Orlando in New York@mani_ajt @tbl_lancewinnz @NeeNeeSr15 @LegionHoops @FadeawayWorld Matchup. Orlando had the Cavs number that season. They won their regular season matchups 2 to 1, and both of their Ws were blowouts. They took advantage of Cavs not having a better big than Z, allowing the Magic to play their game and forcing the Cavs out of their own.@OhSnapsItsShaq To the Orlando magic ....hopefully him or bates lol@ScooterMagruder The @OrlandoMagic I can’t wait til 2030!@BrianJayjack @OrlandoMagic 🤣🤣🤣 I choose where my money goes. And if the Magic ever decide to be competent,  then I might support them@SkolVikes_Paul Spoken like a true @OrlandoMagic fan!@ORLmuse @OrlandoMagic @chicagobulls @franzboogie @wendellcarter34 @NikolaVucevic While the trade was great, I miss VU He was Orlando Magic always. Wish we can trade for him. We need a guy like him.The 20-54 orlando magic have the second worst record in the NBA and even they have more wins against contenders than the Chicago Bulls do😭Touted by @MontePooleNBCS after the loss to the @OrlandoMagic (albeit with Porter not Kuminga) 👌

Why it’s a good move given the absence of @StephenCurry30 👇

Is it just the bias towards high volume scoring ?@OrlandoMagic I'm on my knees please take Vooch back the world needs to see the greatness of Wendell Andre Carter Jr. https://t.co/y7JT19zY28
