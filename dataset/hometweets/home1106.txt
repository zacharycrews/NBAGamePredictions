Fans are worried about playing the Nets in the 1st round?

This team couldn‚Äôt beat the Orlando Magic in a 7 game series!@jespvagberg Orlando Magic tweet of the year@ORLmuse @OrlandoMagic @chicagobulls @franzboogie @wendellcarter34 @NikolaVucevic And they all thought he was that good  superstar caliberüòÇü§£. He was trash. No leadership, barely played defense. Always lost on pick and roll defense.

Warriors have been strange this season. üò´ü§£@OrlandoMagic im pissed https://t.co/tVxd0oZIDtTicked off! @Orlando Magic https://t.co/oPcUckMDR5@mckennaconor To be fair, the NBA also has regional sports networks that we don‚Äôt have in Canada. You wouldn‚Äôt be able to watch the Orlando Magic on Bally Sports Orlando in New York@mani_ajt @tbl_lancewinnz @NeeNeeSr15 @LegionHoops @FadeawayWorld Matchup. Orlando had the Cavs number that season. They won their regular season matchups 2 to 1, and both of their Ws were blowouts. They took advantage of Cavs not having a better big than Z, allowing the Magic to play their game and forcing the Cavs out of their own.@OhSnapsItsShaq To the Orlando magic ....hopefully him or bates lol@ScooterMagruder The @OrlandoMagic I can‚Äôt wait til 2030!@BrianJayjack @OrlandoMagic ü§£ü§£ü§£ I choose where my money goes. And if the Magic ever decide to be competent,  then I might support them@SkolVikes_Paul Spoken like a true @OrlandoMagic fan!@ORLmuse @OrlandoMagic @chicagobulls @franzboogie @wendellcarter34 @NikolaVucevic While the trade was great, I miss VU He was Orlando Magic always. Wish we can trade for him. We need a guy like him.The 20-54 orlando magic have the second worst record in the NBA and even they have more wins against contenders than the Chicago Bulls doüò≠Touted by @MontePooleNBCS after the loss to the @OrlandoMagic (albeit with Porter not Kuminga) üëå

Is it just the bias towards high volume scoring ?@OrlandoMagic I'm on my knees please take Vooch back the world needs to see the greatness of Wendell Andre Carter Jr. https://t.co/y7JT19zY28
