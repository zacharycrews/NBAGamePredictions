The issue was the defense gave up 115 points when they avg 102.

If not I am moving my fandom to the detroit Pistons where they actually know how to build a winning franchise.@MobleyTakeover @cavs Don't know why he was in the game with Okoro down the stretch... he literally just said that DG is the best closer in the league and then took the bal out of his hands in the clutch during the fourth ???@usneverthem22 @erictwigs @vltrdlcrz @GiveCadeTheBall @UmmPut @cavs keep changing the subject mf@j_boncela23 @dietdrbob @sabalabading @LucasAG911 @cavs Talk a lot of smack for someone who lives in Ohio@WetroitWistons @j_boncela23 @cavs City on the come up they don’t wanna talk about that tho@cavs This one is on J.B. Rondo should not be out there closing the game. Jarrett was gassed in the 4th for some reason and he left him out there . Bad loss. Love our guys but we are better than this . Go Cavs@cavs Really bad loss… #Rondo shooting 3s when we need a bucket and bricking floaters and #dariusgarland just dribbling the ball into the ground done the stretch only do dump it to Osman with 2 sec left, cmon, that’s not good basketball@j_boncela23 @gdupdate_when @LucasAG911 @cavs What’s funny about people suffering you Cleveland fans have no class🤢@erictwigs @vltrdlcrz @GiveCadeTheBall @UmmPut @cavs 12 wins 🔥🔥🔥🔥@cavs Y'all are being hunted now. Time for a defense mechanism@cavs ffs that's embarrassing@j_boncela23 @gdupdate_when @WetroitWistons @cavs Has nothing to do with basketball also you’re literally in a worse city don’t care@cavs That's why Cade is ROTY ahahaha your twin towers were trash, just like your organization.@toBmooD @HonestTrumpster @cavs His shooting is just absolutely useless.@cavs Pathetic. C#@cavs seat down CEDI when he was the hot man,you put Wade who was lost in defense and then you put Rondo for what? there was no need at that time! we needed Offensive! You had to enter Cedi who was the one who was hot! and at the same time makes it easier for him to play Garland.@cavs@j_boncela23 @WetroitWistons @LucasAG911 @cavs cant talk about detroit sports being poverty when ur from cleveland lil bro@j_boncela23 @LucasAG911 @cavs Cade has more triple-doubles@toBmooD @samh8876 @HonestTrumpster @cavs Bro shot 2 air balls in a row.@tmariisawesome @cavs First game of a back to back.

As did Rondo@cavs Go get Terence Davis.@cavs Worse loss of the season......@TomLasby @cavs I had no idea what Rondo was doing with ball. DG was like: What? Now you are passing to me near the timeline?@AmNotEvan seat down CEDI when he was the hot man,you put Wade who was lost in defense and then you put Rondo for what? there was no need at that time! we needed Offensive! You had to enter Cedi who was the one who was hot! and at the same time makes it easier for him to play Garland @cavs@tmariisawesome @cavs Exactly what I'm saying. DG, Okoro, Mobley, Allen did not nearly play enough in a game that we need to win with how close the standings are that was beyond ugly@j_boncela23 @sabalabading @LucasAG911 @cavs How many years did it take for your team to win a chip? Don't talk to me about poverty. Besides y'all still making the playoffs, it's just one game, let me enjoy this win.@cavs Man you guys suck.

Don’t even mention Cade.@duhs53248886 @cavs Eh flow of the season is always weird lol it was though I gotta blame Rondo for this one tbh@cavs Love should play more if you serious about winning without 3 rotation players@cavs Don't ever play Rondo with Garland to end a game coach. Wade should have been in with Garland.@j_boncela23 @LucasAG911 @cavs Cleveland fan talking about poverty😭@Fromthe_six14 @cavs If we lose tomorrow, we literally jinxed ourselves….@vltrdlcrz @GiveCadeTheBall @UmmPut @cavs Just for us to pick a better player than you again.Game 49 vs. Cleveland Cavaliers.

PISTONS WIN!

Good win from the Pistons tonight. They showed a lot of fight in this one after a rough start.

Saddiq, Cade, Isaiah, Frank and Trey all had big nights.

Why not just call ahead say ….YOU win or flip a coin . Seriously just stand around and don’t make ANY effort on defense. Wow .@cavs Some days you get the bear. Other days, the bear gets you. It happens. Maybe some home cooking will help.@LiversFor3 @cavs Naw that’s still MobleyI get the @cavs not wanting to mortgage the future on these dudes on the trade market but if they could've gotten Gordon for the rockets pick and Rubio and haven't they're idiots.@TomLasby @dmansworld474 @cavs They were letting rondo shoot threes with two minutes left...@cavs Losing to the freaking Pistons after being up 15-0!!!! That’s pathetic.  Cmon man@MaiseynJoshDad @cavs Awful. Move on to the next one@cavs Y'all lost to The Detroit Pistons..

Became complacent after being up 15-0.   Rondo was terrible down the stretch. Send @Dylan_Windler23 back to Canton.  I know the Charge moved to CLE. Bigs played soft again.  They should dominate the restricted zone.  Have to learn from this.@dmansworld474 @cavs Need another creating guard. Rondo should never get final 4 minutes. Very disappointing #Cavs #letemknow@cavs How the hell did yall let this happen@cavs Windler and rondo smh we need to make a move before the deadline a guy that can score when garland sits boy we miss rubio@confidence_CM @cavs garland didn't do nothin wrong@cavs Terrible@cavs suck.

Just like how Kansas City fucked up at the end of the second quarter this game could actually come back to haunt us. Play 24/7 you idiots. I mean, are you kidding me@cavs Worst loss of the year by far@cavs What the heckTough loss for the @cavs. This stretch of games is very winnable - but they need to make sure they keep their killer instincts sharp and never let a lesser team out-hustle them. #letemknow@cavs Yeahh allen playing like pussy bruh no way.Next big lesson for the @cavs being the hunted and not the hunter. #letEmKnow@cavs Shameful, especially from JB@cavs Me to Rondo https://t.co/8vI5ST4IvQ@cavs That was an absolute embarrassment. A wake up call is needed — this team has done absolutely nothing yet to warrant that type of performance.

Their bench were +13, +16, +20 &amp; +21...First time all season the @cavs truly fell apart in fourth quarter. Became unglued and frenetic. Out-hustled and out-muscled. Bizarre decisions with ball. That was rough to watch, because Cavs have spoiled us.Need to make that up big time tomorrow @Cavs. Especially since I will be there floor side.0-3…. What a colossal waste of a sports day… thanks @OhioStateHoops @USMNT and @cavs@cavs Exposed as expected💀💀 never call Mobley ROTY again bums@cavs Not even a pistons fan I just love their you just lost to memes@cavs They wanted it more than us…@cavs Triple Dub on yall ass!!! https://t.co/6cpO9Zdhzj@cavs @isaacokoro303 You lost to the Pistons.

He’s okay. Lol@thaddeus_j_s @cavs Nice to meet you as well. Occasionally I search ‘Cleveland NFTs’ to see what I come up with. I want to start a local meetup@cavs I didn't think Garland was a good PICK, but I was WRONG this dude has mad SKILLS. RESPECT@MobleyTakeover @cavs He’s played well@dillybar2145 @cavs Might have to pee 😂😂@cavs trade windler@Tyguy_clutch @cavs Nope. I didn’t even notice anything happened so he might be fine@dillybar2145 @cavs Damn, did you see anything in game?@ScottSorrell1 @SkrticX @cavs @EncyCle_ @thiswascle I’ve never been to Cleveland, have no idea what Whitey’s is but somehow feel like I can identify with this!@RobOstrom @ChrisFedor Yeah Mobley is good &amp; only going to get better as he gains experience &amp; strength. You do a good job of covering the Cleveland Cavaliers. *Would like you to stick to that. Your tweet about the Cleveland Browns this morning was uncalled for &amp; mean spirited. Uncalled for!Myself included very proud of #Cavs @cavs https://t.co/1sYD8GhHji@mark_phelan @cavs That would certainly have been preferable. Model differences, perhaps.@KeithAdams00 @cavs @evanmobley @Bengals Good for them because it's Ohio.  But, don't knock the Cavs.  Go knock them somewhere else.  Until Cincinnati has a basketball team, shut the up.@allysonnewell @cavs Awesome! Nice to meet you!@cavs Y’all gotta focus &amp; get this W. Don’t rush things. Detroit is playing fr@cavs What are we doing@dillybar2145 @cavs What happened@cavs How is it so close?@cavs Okoro good?@Cavs with a big 4th quarter coming up.

He has to improve on shooting. Just keep working #35 looking goodEveryone does 1,000 free throws after the game today @cavs@JoshuaBishop_ @KingJames @cavs Nobody wants him he’s old &amp; has no clue about loyalty… let him sink with the lakers 😂@EnterNa92175530 @cavstroII @cavs @dariusgarland22 what@SkrticX @cavs @EncyCle_ @thiswascle Saw U2, Prince, original Van Halen among others there.
