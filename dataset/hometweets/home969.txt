The Dallas Mavericks are 10-2 SU &amp; 10-2 ATS in their last 12 games overall.  One of their non-covers came against the Kings in their last game, but they were without Luka Doncic.  He is expected to return to the lineup tonight.@ChampCityPod It was about right for that time.  Dallas Mavericks paid a $12 million expansion fee to join the NBA in 1980.   Miami, Charlotte, Minnesota and Orlando each paid $32M each in 88-89.Dallas Mavericks
