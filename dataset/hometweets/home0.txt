Along with little bro Kostas, they are now all NBA champions.

Grayson Allen and the Milwaukee Bucks have agreed to a two-year, $20 million extension.

The Bucks acquired Allen from the Memphis Grizzlies in a trade this summer. Allen set career highs in points (10.6), rebounds (3.2) and assists (2.2) per game last season.@loicpodcast @Bucks lol that very well may be true…EXCEPT when your team is getting their rings. https://t.co/RSYU8uuDyD@x_WolfMan_41 @DarikClevinger @ChuckFreimund @Bucks They wanted him gone after 2017 when they did the 30 year celebration with Jon Mcglocklin. That why they celebrated it so much. Only Paschke pushed back. The dude called Bucks games through all those terrible years and they are now perennial contenders!

#NBA75My dad and I have been to 30+ @Bucks games dating back to 2013 against the Rockets. Our last game was Game 4 of the Finals. Tonight, we celebrate, but I wanted to look back over those years. This is a small sample size of the many highlights we’ve seen to lead us to tonight: https://t.co/f0FAHR6v4A@NBA @BrooklynNets @Bucks @warriors @Lakers Coaches and GMs in your league no longer have the power to do thier job, you applauded a players run league, and now coaches are nutless fools who can’t control anything , Ben Simmons is the prime example of the nba having zero control@nbatopshot @Bucks @BrooklynNets One of our best! 🇨🇦@Bucks Good reminder that the Bucks are better than his childhood team the bulls.@Rafiqomair @Bucks_Take @FanMahome @statmuse Dude put a full page article in the Milwaukee Newspaper explaining why he should be MVP over Giannis. I wonder why Giannis doesn’t like him 🤔🤔@WisconsinWan03 @NBA @BrooklynNets @Bucks @warriors @Lakers If he can(not talking about KD level just average level) that's a RIP for the NBA. if he also improved his free throws on the way I can see him averaging around 30 ppg(maybe even more) which is something no big since Shaq did@BenBrust @Bucks @DaveKoehnPxP Congrats Ben!The 75th NBA season is here‼👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍

Great way to cause a lot of confusion in ball screen coverage! Use of the split/ram screen in the lane can confuse the primary coverage. Then, the use of the baseline pin for the other guard can distort the backside and help side coverage. #NBA 🏀 https://t.co/nVoZs0loVm@DylanFrew6 @9fingerDK @AmandaBeckerTV @Bucks Tonight's game is not sold out.
