Lebron is old, AD is always hurt and Westbrooke is lost and past his prime. Not to mention the Lakers have no bench. I say AD gets hurt during this game or even in warmups.Boston Celtics x Philadelphia 76ers

#PlayLikeABaller@celtics This is my simple advice to the Celtics
Stop playing and take this game very serious like a playoff series because how you start this game may be how you finish the regular season!!  So this game is an early test and send a message why teams don't want to play
You post season!!The @MLB got what they wanted. Also, I may never be able to listen to Bob Costas commentate anything every again. 

Start the @sixers vs. @celtics game already.Jaylen Brown Boston Celtics Nike Icon Edition Swingman Jersey Men's 2022/23 NBA https://t.co/7h9o75i1ue eBay https://t.co/YdlLxjqvk6Ms Janas did not take a likeing to that foul.

I started watching a little bit of this game. Triple double in a 3 point win over the Lakers, held Kareem to 5-13 shooting / 15 points. Seems like all the elements of a good time.
