Tip: Brooklyn Nets @ 1.79

The line shifted as it provided too much value on the Nets. The Heat has struggled in the last three games and the back to back will not help. The Nets have too much offense and should take the win here.Erik Spoelstra to miss Heat game vs. Nets; assistant Chris Quinn serving as coach #Miami #Heat #NBA https://t.co/SUhtvZmYe1🏀NBA🏀
Miami Heat vs Brooklyn Nets

The Nets are coming of a disappointing 132-120 loss to the Memphis Grizzlies.🔥

Meanwhile, the Heat's run of poor form continued, as they lost 111-103 to the New York Knicks on Friday.📉

Who will start a new winning streak ?🥇 https://t.co/7tV2EjUPh6Nets coach Steve Nash,on Goran: "Time here in Miami was very special, so it's fitting he would be shown that
type of respect &amp; our team will get joy out of it." Heat loves him, but reunion here wasn't realistic because of Vincent's development &amp; more opportunity to play elsewhere https://t.co/du5cZrebqU@MiamiHEAT @betwayusa Update?The Miami Heat vs Brooklyn Nets game should be great.

The Miami Heat has lost three in a row, and could lose the first place in the East with a loss and a Bucks win

@5ReasonsSports https://t.co/hop52eYzGb@MiamiHEAT I’m convinced they’re losing on purpose@DorisPerc @vGodMannu @JorSuperTeam @LegendOfWinning No, not even close. Lebron fans followed harder than people becoming Curry fans. We not about to let that Miami Heat save slide. I vividly remember the Heat and Seahawks having the most bandwagon fans during this time.Must watch matchup of the night in the NBA has to be Heat vs Nets

#HEATCulture #NBA75 #NBATwitter https://t.co/TKOpyuyOwOI for real think Heat fans love Goran Dragic more than Jimmy and Bam. Not that its a competition but it shows you how important Dragic was to Miami fans@svorpion_ @MiamiHEAT @FTX_Official We need him for that deep run into playoffs, we realize Dedmon is not back up enough for him,..i’d be happy if Spo played Yurtseven,..at this point am focusing on playoffs than 1st seed bruh@fcbjosee You act like the heat arent the most succesful miami franchise and isnt the top team in the east rnAfter losing to the New York Knicks, the Miami Heat will welcome another New York team into FTX Arena.

Is this the time to shine for Brooklyn? Or, will the Heat answer with a clean sweep?

Put yourselves in the shoes of these players for a second, you really think these players/coaches being payed MILLIONS to play bball well are perfectly fine with losing...@AshNicoleMoss Did the Miami Heat team figure out where they were going for dinner?!Miami Heat are a regular season team, they peak early in the season and usually run out of gas when the playoffs are about to start.

They came out stronger and beat my team's ass. The fact that both are not 9th-11th like some teams is crazy to me still based on how they started.@UNISOLDIERMUA @MiamiHEAT W thenGames tonight for Celtics fans to check on:

Bulls vs Cavs 8:00 (get closer to securing a top 4 seed.)

Nets vs Heat 8:00 (Miami loss puts Boston half a game behind the 1 spot.)

Bucks vs Grizzles 8:00 (Bucks loss ties them with the Celtics for the 3 seed.)The Knicks pulled off one of their most impressive comebacks in years last night, coming up big down the stretch to take down the top seed in the East Miami Heat

The most unbelievable part? They did it without a "real point guard," writes @MMiranda613:
https://t.co/uOi5yW6no0The Miami heat owe me 500$ for throwing that fucking game last night. Bitch asses trynna duck the Nets in the play offs tanking games.@MiamiHEAT @FTX_Official pls win...pls stop choking games late in the 4th quarter.....you can't rely on free throws to win the game....you need to work hard for it.If the Miami Heat lose and the Bucks Win Milwaukee will be the first seed in the East for the first time since opening nightBrooklyn Nets release lengthy injury report ahead of potential playoff preview against Miami Heat: https://t.co/ZPmceQiwOWWith a Leafs loss and a Bruins win today, Boston would move into sole possession of 2nd place in the Atlantic.

With Bucks, Heat, and Sixers (tomorrow) losses and a Celtics win (tomorrow), Boston (H2H tiebreaker over Miami) would move into 1st place in the East.

▪︎Bam's inconsistent play.

▪︎ Rebounding

BAM is a 4 and DEDMON into start. move JIMMY to 2 spot and TUCKER to 3. Keep LOWRY.
Bench:
1. HERRO for TUCKER. 
2. DIPO for LOWRY.
3. KEEF for BAM. 
4. YURT for DEDMON.
5. DUNCAN for JIMMY.

Guess I’ll chill on the sofa all day@Anthony_Chiang This whole collapse was inevitable .
The day @miamiheat sent @kyleguy away.
The negative energy took over this team. 
There is a darkness here.
The universe telling the organization that releasing Kyle was a journey altering decision, that will effect the team for a decade.@MiamiHEAT I need ya to get it together like NOWmiami heat warming up for that first round exit roster revamp summer season😄Quickley 👍

We need offense and he offers soo much more than Dedmon. Better scorer better rebounder and a decent defender. I recall how he was giving it to Embiid.@MiamiHEAT @betwayusa Didn’t happen@MiamiHEAT my god stop playing Dedmon and let fucking Omir play man. Stop playing Morris. I love pj tucker but we get shit out of him on the regular. I don't understand why Duncan is still starting.

I been tryna tell the world miami needs a superstar that can get 25 A NIGHT easily.So the Miami Heat w/o Tyler Herro can't beat the Sixers w/o Harden and Embiid, can't beat Warriors w/o Steph, Klay and Dray and they can't beat the Knicks w/o Randle

That was a great time.@MiamiHEAT Where’s the bosh content at with all due respect? https://t.co/VjuMXD5yP4@MiamiHEAT Still gotta face the nets eventually…not sure why y’all tanking forThose Miami Heat scumbagz 🤣🤣🤣🤣Let’s not forget something, Duncan Robinson has regressed considerably. Easily the biggest thorn in Miami’s side. Miami ironically seems to be running out of steam cause they play so damn hard. What a horrific week of basketball for @MiamiHEAT .#HeatTwitter should be concerned.Holy fuck the Miami Heat lost. A dub tonight makes the #1 spot within fucking arm’s reachY’all gonna fight about being outscored by 20 in the 4th? @MiamiHEAT@MiamiHEAT @MiamiHEAT Completely TRASH.. leading 17points then get L😂😂😂 U will be sweep in the playoffs 4 sure😂@AboutToRatioU @MiamiHEAT Last time the knicks won a championship?@MiamiHEAT Bubble fraudsI had realistic goals for my Miami Heat this year. I didn’t get caught up in the “we got Kyle Lowry &amp; PJ Tucker” hype. Their best games are behind them BUT they’re still good enough to make it out of the 1st round.

Hopefully.@MiamiHeat_fan22 I own you bozo@MiamiHEAT As an honest heat fan it pains me to say this but we’re a first round exit. We’re finished.

They're a bottom offense team. Too many open looks, gets easly penetrated and can't rebound. What happened to Miami lately🤧The Miami Heat's rebounding in their last 4 losses:

34-45 v Philly
34-45 vs GSW
53-46 vs MIN
38-55 vs Phoenix

So far tonight, 5-10 vs New York

No rebounds, no wins. 

That's been the Heat's biggest concern, imo.
