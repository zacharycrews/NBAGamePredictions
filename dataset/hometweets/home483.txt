Miami Heat -6 

First half (2*)Boxing day basketball action 🍿🍿

Miami Heat v Orlando Magic@wgt497 @HHelvitica @Kelesxs Bam and Jimmy have missed nearly half the games and Lowry has led the Heat to 20-13 regardless. It’s really not even close. If Lakers could trade Russ for Lowry they’d 100% do it.

Intermittent napping and Xmas leftovers necessary.It's being said a lot, but imma echo it. When Lebron didn't handpicked his teams in Miami, he consistently had the best teams of his career. Top 3 Lebron teams all time might be all Heat squads. At the very least it's the 12 and 13 Heat with the 16 Cavs.@MiamiHEAT I want to believe Kyle wanted a 10days rest, ‘coz man i don’t get it!,..it sucks for a leader like Kyle to expose himself to covid, that recklessness is so disappointing, does he realize he’s been key for all wins we had in Jimmy’s absence?!Bro the freaking Miami heat went on a 6 game losing streak back in 2011 I WAS FREAKING THERE https://t.co/MQwXMlQnlUCan the @MiamiHEAT  sign @DwyaneWade to a 10 day contract? 🤔🤔🔥🔥@Lakers should trade @russwest44 to the @MiamiHEAT just because @C_L_Anthony likes him. I think he’s one of only a couple fans left…. 4-20 and O from 3pt??? Come on son!!! You’re trash 🗑! Basura!!!Borussia Dortmund (Weeman) - Juventus (Kit)

Nothing ur saying has any value. Just a bitter Heat fan spewing nonsense opinion@mystickybun @305ontherisee @MiamiHEAT You for real? This shows how uninformed people are about COVID &amp; the vaccine.

Jimmy Butler (tailbone) and P.J. Tucker (leg) are listed as questionable.

Markeiff Morris (neck) and Kyle Lowry (health and safety protocols) have been ruled out.@MiamiHEAT Herro is a 60-min's player, and I seen it his Rook Year, Hes got that thing, only a few players have, It don't matter whether he get a [All-Star] pick,We
 the Heat Nation knows he is a star, so Herro keep being a 60-min's player and you'll always be great,@MiamiHEAT Got some tickets 🔥Should the Heat sign Micah Potter with a 10-day hardship contract? Any thoughts @MiamiHEAT fans?@JasmineeCena32 Miami Heat shirt is 🔥@MiamiHEAT Couldn’t get tickets though :(@QuantChild @snack_attacck The Heat has no intention of starting Herro.

Was only a matter of time until it started to spread among HEAT players.@MiamiHEAT @mchalmers15 it's time https://t.co/RjpHEKz5ZyThis is the one guy Miami couldn’t lose.

Without Kyle, the Heat would be no where near 20-13 with the injures this season. 

He’s been so invaluable to this squad in so many ways. He deserves a ton of credit in instilling confidence in the younger guys. https://t.co/GdE4EwtQAvHello @MiamiHEAT, @InterMiamiCF, @MiamiDolphins, and @LVAces!
