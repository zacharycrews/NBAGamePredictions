Former NBA PF @DonatasMot tells @RickKamlaSports and @Mitch_Lawrence he has questions about it and thinks the NBPA should independently review Bol Bol’s physical health. https://t.co/yNOWBluv6EThe Raptors are in Detroit Rock City to take on the Pistons.

Scottie Barnes (knee) game-time decision
Gary Trent Jr. (ankle) OUTWholesome.

@Dreamville_33 🤝 @RodneyMcGruder https://t.co/TimbzECvgd@NBAspain @DetroitPistons HillThey act like they invested so much in him.  If the move didn’t work out, it’s not like you traded Cade Cunningham for him.  I mean, are these the guys who drafted Sekou, yet they want to give Bolx2 a hard time?

Come on now.  @DetroitPistons are losing fans at an elite level.@DetroitPistons @Raptors This isnt good news@DetroitPistons brass are 🤡 for voiding for the @BolBol deal.  I don’t think they realized how much the fans were looking forward to seeing him in action. 

Bol is a BELOVED member of the association, and for the FO to label him as medically unfit—that harms careers. F-YOU FO.The Toronto Raptors will be without Gary Trent Jr. Friday against the Detroit Pistons as he continues to deal with an ankle injury.

Rookie Scottie Barnes remains questionable with a knee injury.
