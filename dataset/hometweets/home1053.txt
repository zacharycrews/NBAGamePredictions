Jazz could easily screw around and end up 7th. I wouldn't tempt it.@utahjazz Noooo! Husband and I are going to the game with lower bowl seats for once (for our anniversary) and now I’m not as excited.😭 I expected Donovan to play and hoped Bojan would be back.@utahjazz Of course he’s out the one game I get to sit lower BowlChicago Bulls: Chicago #Bulls at Utah Jazz odds, picks and predictions - Sportsbook Wire https://t.co/zQ3HW200Bv@RobertSchloss @JacobCHatch @ZoneSportsNet @tlacomb @utahjazz @LawMurrayTheNU @PKKinahan The Irish is strong with him https://t.co/Xzzr5ihwBA@RavenLouiVillen @utahjazz @spidadmitchell That's gas. Excited for you mate!#utahjazz FANS! https://t.co/IaNBWm74fx@utahjazz @realsaltlake @JustinMeram Who's the giant lady?Looks like a team that’s played 5 games in 8 days… 9:20pm local tip on Tuesday three time zones away. If this were the Utah Jazz the result would be written off before the clock strikes 0:00.

Excited for Hood-Schifino and Woodson’s second year with these guys.
