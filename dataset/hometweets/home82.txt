@NBCSBulls @chicagobulls 

https://t.co/kVUzOlBHLE@chicagobulls @ATT @ATT @NikolaVucevic he will hit the first 3@chicagobulls @FirstAlert I just have a feeling he should‚Äôve been the starter all along. Patrick Williams never really got his legs all the way under him. Passing up open shots not being aggressive he wasn‚Äôt all the way there.

Toni was a decorated European and international player.@SoxOld @LynetteT @chicagobulls You do understand that players dont go to HOF just for their NBA career but for overal career perfomance and Kukoc would deserve to be HOF even if he never played in NBA :)P.S.

People in New York pronounce E's as hard A's and I's as soft E's. 

That is a common expression in New York, 

the 97-98 Bulls did have the Best Bulls record in History, 

and they did lose 20 games. 

So.... Nope.@chicagobulls @BCBSIL Love it !! ü§ûüèºIt's great having basketball back.  It's the sport I've associated most with success.  As a kid, my @chicagobulls won 6 championships.  In high school, #gordontech went downstate when I was a senior.  And in college, @MarquetteMBB reached the Final Four. 1/3@chicagobulls @BCBSIL Toni was my favorite player alreaydy In Jugosplastika Split. I became a Bulls fan when he joined the team.
