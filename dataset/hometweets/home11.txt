how dareth thou say he’s not amazing for television. #CarryTheHellOn. HA!@gabzillla_ @trailblazers Follow my twitch link here: https://t.co/WA0WRcbB5T@trailblazers @NBA @stormxio @GoatYogaOregon I love this. Good job Mark. It's too bad I can't watch the blazers since they went to that Roots channel.@moelaarag0 @trailblazers yeah mitchell won’t start@elkbruess @trailblazers Yeah fr they could do that but I don’t think that’s what their starting lineup is idk thoSo excited for tonight!!! Let’s go @trailblazers@lousybeard @trailblazers But it also makes me feel better about pirating the games! To the high seas, fellow shipmate!@lousybeard @trailblazers At the end of the day, they’re a massive corporate enterprise, chiefly concerned with the profitability of their “product” and you just kinda have to live with that I guessThe @trailblazers fired their coach who led them to eight consecutive playoff appearances.. and then hired a rookie to take his place. It's funny how many teams just can't get out of their own way.I will be singing the national anthem at the @trailblazers season opener tonight.@lousybeard @trailblazers I’m in the same boat. I feel let down &amp; gaslighted by the organization. They didn’t do enough. The sad thing is, they know the fan base is loyal enough that they can do whatever the f they want, which is a shame.Salamat @trailblazers for bringing the team closer to Pinoy fans through @trailblazersph.

I became a Trail Blazers fan thanks to the clutch plays of @Dame_Lillard and @CJMcCollum.
