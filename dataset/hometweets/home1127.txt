- Klay, Dray, and Otto might not play since its a second night of a B2B
- black jerseys
- The Memphis Grizzlies have a 17-2 record without Ja Morant this season.

But...
- Andre might (not saying will) play tomorrow.

So, I guess we'll see.Bomani's Memphis Grizzlies wrap-up was really fun@Titans, @Vol_Hoops 😭 (still got hope @PredsNHL and @memgrizz 👀) https://t.co/eIwmymAteS@DB_5trey @memgrizz That’s what happens when your team wins the most 25+ point games since the 2016-2017 Warriors.

And hey, maybe we’ll get some bandwagon fans out of it-the Grizz are sure overdue for some!@haileyaleah2 @stillnocenter so here's what's going down possibly
