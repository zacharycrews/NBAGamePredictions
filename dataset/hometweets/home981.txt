Don't sleep on it.The @MiamiHEAT were on their way to their second straight NBA championship.Heat open -8 vs Suns, peak at -8.5, then plunge to -3.5 after Phoenix's Booker cleared to play and Miami's Butler listed as questionable to play.

Booker missed the last four games, while the Suns went 3-1 without their leading scorer. https://t.co/MqsCiPfFlA@MoternMedia @juanmotoa @FlaPanthers @MiamiHEAT In your defense, they did play like a minor league team for quite some time, but the program has made a huge turn around!@BookBettaa @statmuse @Suns @MiamiHEAT You are extremely delusional. The suns are literally play in without CP3, every season or games where he doesn't play they are 0.500 or below. Btw CP3 carries the suns not booker, I think it's time for us fans to look at impact more than numbers.@MoternMedia @juanmotoa @FlaPanthers @MiamiHEAT I can’t tell if that’s an insult https://t.co/lGLdXa8FfP@010_heat @MelloMD90 @NBAonTNT @SHAQ Plus, Miami had a one point loss at Milwaukee without Lowry.
