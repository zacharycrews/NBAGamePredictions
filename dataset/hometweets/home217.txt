“The Lakers have taken the floor”, ESPN reports.

The Lakers are playing tonight in Milwaukee. THE CHAMPIONS have already taken the floor, but the ESPN never cared for the Bucks. 

Instead, we’ve been watching a 40-year old dribbling the ball and missing lay-ups for an hour.Khris Middleton returns to the Bucks as Milwaukee faces the Lakers without LeBron James tonight. Get live updates from Fiserv Forum.

@Bucks' Raven Jemison #BrandweekSportsThe Milwaukee bucks agreeing to a deal with McDonald’s. I don’t think any sports team or pro athlete should be sponsored by fast food as they rep healthy diets and healthy life style. I think its a bad fit and can cause bad noise.#SRM3224The Bucks and McDonald’s recently partnered for a special meal deal in Milwaukee.

Wednesday, November 17, 2021 is Pace Mannion Day! Congrats, Pace!Game day - making our first @LateNightLakers road trip of the season up to Milwaukee for Lakers Bucks. 

Any Lakers fans that’s going to the game hml. Got a couple pieces of merch to giveaway that I’m bringing with. 

Let’s get it. Top of the top!Given his relative youth and inexperience, can Semi Ojeleye actually take on the PJ Tucker role for this Milwaukee Bucks team later down the road as most fans seem to believe? Here’s what his performances so far say.
