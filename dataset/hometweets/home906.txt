He is also pg dependent which I don't like. This is the NBA you need to be able to get your own shot he can't do that. He stays on the perimeter way too much and when he gets the ball out there it's like he is playing hot 🥔 with the ball.@knicks100aGM @nyknicks Smh. Really, it's like that?Yo @spidadmitchell:Serious question, what is it gonna take to convince YOU that the Knicks are worth your time!?Speak on it,then let them make it happen @Knickschatter @nyknicks @TheGarden@hhpthebook @nyknicks GOTTA WATCH THEM QUICKLY DUDES NOW YA MANS LIKE ABANDONING SHIP LIKE FK IT ILL DO IT MYSELF 🤣🤣NO DEUCE HIVE FOR YOU🤣@JYoung856Ball @sixers @ABC @975TheFanatic @nyknicks @Ticketmaster Tobi is legit. Him as the third or fourth option will be glorious@SuperJude_ @nyknicks @RjBarrett6 @spidadmitchell I agree,we always went for the home run to only smack a triple!But Julius &amp;RJ would benefit from a a true playmaker who can dish,make his own shot and take the ball out of their hands!The youngins we got not that,But I’m not mad.We need “TEAM” pieces,NOT just pieces!@EDemirNBA @NBA_NewYork Lol I think your looking too much into it... he’s just staying he wants the “green light” to be more creative on offense like Plumlee .. not the “greenlight” to leave the Knicks@sixers @ABC @975TheFanatic @nyknicks @Ticketmaster Drop 200, you won't@Knickstape2005 @rahmmagick @queens_dude @AJTheManChild @DonaldP47082631 @Knickanators @0oty_Mac @StateNYKPOD @Woodshed_1914 @Rick__War @BadBadLeroyBro7 @YankeesKnicks99 @JeDiGoLLuM01 @eepdllc @TruePG718 @eski225 @Markjoh91017488 @J1gg__ @Christian_J_D_M @Trace_AVP @Jaelin_Taylor @ShannonTFortune @Chuck1one @SellDaTeamDolan @DababyfannNYK @LegionOfKnicks @PreZnyc621 @TMal761 @_knicks1688 @IanChisolm @RMPChats @victorlb03 @Sharonchik266 @StepThroughJoe @quietknicksfan @RTaylor2283 @EdMemphisPimpin @nightnurse38 @Not47Buddz @LukeHen73716015 @Julius_DL @Freekeith @KnicksBig15 @stalling_e @MikeFromQns7 @MikeK634 @acedghill @boxand21 @nyknicks Fair point. I didn't like obi coming out of school so I may have a bias. I have also said if you put his skill set in a wide open offense it would be a better fit for his game. He was just the wrong pick for this coach and organizationI'm dusting off the Sneakers, somebody said the @nyknicks needed a PG. Put me in coach. I only need a few things before I start. Oxygen on standby, two Jelly Doughnuts before every game. I can only play 2 minutes each half and I can only play once a month.

I want to see Randle play so bad that he retires. Thibs won’t go anywhere because the Knicks organization thinks he’s right! 26-56 final record.  I honestly don’t see them winning two more games@theblondebroker @UniqueUnicorns_ @nyknicks I has the same black jacket but zippers in the sleeves@KnicksMSGN @RjBarrett6 @nyknicks He’s developing into an all star slowly.  In time he’s going to be our superstar for us and I can’t wait for that when the time comes @RjBarrett6@nyknicks I don’t think the fans have come to terms on how bad this team and coach are.  We got wins this season when all the other teams were figuring out there offensive and defensive schemes. The Knicks were lucky to get 25 wins this season. The coaching and play are horrible@theblondebroker @UniqueUnicorns_ @nyknicks Thanks u 😘The father of New York #Knicks center Mitchell Robinson, reported missing on Feb. 13, has been found.
