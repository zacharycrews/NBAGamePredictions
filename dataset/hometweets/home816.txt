I mean if they got a great complimentary player for DL I’d get it but they got garbage! Was it to clear up cap space? I’m confused@Dame_Lillard addressing the @trailblazers fans before the start of the game after the trade.

https://t.co/V4PO5Wi10m@AndersKorman @trailblazers @BuffaloBills At least they got an NBA championship. It's been 45 years since the Blazers won one. After the trades, looks like it's going to be longer for the next one than we all thought.@KarlaReed52 @trailblazers I don't believe that Dame is leaving or being traded. I believe they have a plan and we'll see if they are able to pull it off. I'm sure Dame is super sad over seeing CJ leave, but again it sounds like the plan is about trying to give a Dame a chance. Rough day though.😭😭We're going to miss @trailblazers @CJMcCollum when he moves to New Orleans to play for the Pelicans. Thank you, CJ, for all of your support of SMART Reading. You are a great champion for literacy! https://t.co/w1bwZRTgDeIt's truly hard to watch what the Portland Trail Blazers are doing to Dame....@romerohill1 @trailblazers Folks rebuilding a team to get put out first round like they ain’t just have that🤦🏾‍♂️To be clear, I love to support the @trailblazers players. But the front office is an absolute garbage fire, and it’s discouraging to see them continually ruin our chances of a playoff championship again and again. At this rate, we’re going to break NBA records for most guards. https://t.co/8Lhg2u0dGe@503Blazerfans It’s as if the @trailblazers are also trading away their fans.@trailblazers @OrlandoMagic @ModaCenter @ROOTSPORTS_NW @RipCityRadio620 lmao Blazers fans are unhinged, couldn’t be me.Orlando Magic @ Portland Trail Blazers

Why would Portland do that? when there is another team that could actually give them value and or draft picks for Dame. Put down the meth pipe.Glad I’m not a @trailblazers fan, this @CJMcCollum trade is 1-2 years too late. I really hope for the sake of @Dame_Lillard and the Trail Blazers fans that the organization know what they’re doing! A COMPLETE rebuild seems more logical but if everyone is on board, have at’em!@CJMcCollum Thank you for being @trailblazers!  I love your game, hard work and integrity.

This line moved from 3.5 since @trailblazers went into tank mode, but I don't think it moved enough.  Blazers will be short staffed and demoralized with no Lillard or McCollum

Overall: 201-165-5I’m so glad @annleehannah took me to see the @trailblazers a few years ago and I got to see @CJMcCollum in person. 

Hell of a player with a lasting impact on the franchise. Now he’s gonna be cooking people up Cajun style.@Catthesleepy1 @moelaarag0 @eaglesnicky @trailblazers @OrlandoMagic @ModaCenter @ROOTSPORTS_NW @RipCityRadio620 Yeah, they make the playoffs and Portland gets a future first instead. It’s possible, but I don’t see them in the playoffs.@TheHoopCentral @wojespn So my @trailblazers didn’t make the dumbest trade today after allI am the biggest Portland Trail Blazers fanEverybody is tweeting like the @CJMcCollum trade has already been made, but neither @trailblazers @PelicansNBA or CJ have confirmed it. I'm pretty sure the deal will be made official, but let's wait for confirmation. @wojespn didn't actually confirm that it's done either.Always a @trailblazers great. Best of luck in the Big Easy, @CJMcCollum.

McCollum in 7-player trade: The New Orleans Pelicans have acquired guard C.J. McCollum from the Portland Trail Blazers as part of a seven-player trade, said two people familiar with the situation. https://t.co/XeOCWF1PQY #RipCity https://t.co/LCB13vJjL3@hashtagfilthy @trailblazers Being competitive might’ve given them an edge in picking up free agents but nobody wants to move to that busted ass city and lose.@trailblazers Collin sexton for dame@TheNBACentral @trailblazers you need veteran presence for the rebuild.  Maybe a former MVP.  If you trade Dame and those New Orleans picks, you might be able to get the legend himself - RUSSELL WESTBROOK.  Better throw in Nurkic too.Huge, bittersweet day for the @trailblazers
1 - @CJMcCollum is an all-time great Blazer. Amazing on the court and even better off. He’s already missed.
2 - the organization finally admitted the team, as constructed, already went as far as it could. Maybe a season too late…@jicox @trailblazers @BuffaloBills Cleveland would like a word with youIf Edwards was on the @trailblazers this deal would have happened https://t.co/LEJNQmLDBU@trailblazers y’all Some hoes for doing CJ like thatJust bought me @trailblazers tickets for the March 30th game against New Orleans.

But right now…
Limbo…

It’s okay to not be satisfied and want better for your team… 🤦🏽‍♂️🦅🌹.@saved_x_love @trailblazers @nyknicks @Dame_Lillard We like to believe that but it’s not happening. Zion don’t want to be in NO - AD had to leave NO. Lillard has not got no where near the attention he should be getting. Why is Mitchell saying he wants to leave Utah and complaining about market. Location matters !!!WHAT IN THE WORLD, @trailblazers?!?!?! YOU ARE KILLING ME!!! BOO!!!!!!!!! BOO I SAY!!!!!!!!!!@saved_x_love @iamjonconyers @trailblazers @nyknicks @Dame_Lillard No one is coming there in free agency . Dame will be asked to be moved next season@trailblazers @OrlandoMagic @ModaCenter @ROOTSPORTS_NW @RipCityRadio620 I cant believe that blazers tarded their second best player! but its fine we going to build this team. we will be 82:0 team soon.@LyleSpencer18 @_R824 @trailblazers They may not want to trade him in the West. There are a lot of better options than Westbrook to clear cap down the road.@iamjonconyers @trailblazers @nyknicks @Dame_Lillard its the perfect era for it. too much media for stars to go unnoticed. You can make money anywhere nowSacramento Kings and Portland Trail Blazers Competing to be the Worst Front Office in the NBA@trailblazers i have a deal do you know THT the future Michael Jordan. We give you him and Russ for Damian Lillard.With the cj domino knocked over can we just get the dame for Simmons trade done please fellas @sixers and @trailblazers@saved_x_love @trailblazers @nyknicks @Dame_Lillard Exactly it’s on him. Kobe could stay a Laker forever he was in one of the biggest market. This ain’t the ERA for that even though I respect it.It hurts like hell but I'll never forget what you did for the @trailblazers  @CJMcCollum . I wish you all the best in New Orleans Pelicans.

Then I saw the @CJMcCollum trade today and I am crying into a pool of my own vomit.@iamjonconyers @trailblazers @nyknicks @Dame_Lillard They would go to play with him smh... you need to leave the small market thing alone... its 2022 you can be a star anywhere@trailblazers @CJMcCollum Absolutely disgusted you are trading away CJ firstly. But to trade him to the Pelicans? WTAF! Not even a contending team? Your organization has become a joke. You have lost me as a fan. And @Dame_Lillard it’s time to look at other options…@VerbalPhenom @trailblazers Edit: bring sabonis from Sacramento and we’re all good @trailblazers #RipCity@1080TheFAN @trailblazers @PelicansNBA Necessary evil!Mixed emotions on seeing him go- as I never held back with my #tradecj thoughts.

They just traded @CJMcCollum away!! SMH https://t.co/cwKnsKwgjK@SacramentoKings @Vivek I gotta ask as a fellow desi, why did you just trade away a stud in @TyHaliburton22 and @buddyhield ? You guys really wanted to make the @trailblazers look like a competent front office I guess?@LockesBrother @CJMcCollum @trailblazers As a lifelong Blazers fan in Denver, I've been really fortunate the Nuggets and Blazers have had so many great series. Was at Dame's insane 55-point Game 5 last year, too. So frustrating the Nuggets pulled it out.@iamjonconyers @trailblazers @nyknicks @Dame_Lillard They traded to make room for free agency bro...Initial NBA trade reactions: What are Sacramento &amp; Portland doing? @trailblazers &amp; @SacramentoKings fans I feel your pain, there had to be better deals or directions to take.@1080TheFAN @trailblazers @PelicansNBA Incomplete. Depends on what they do with the money they freed up@jeffersondsmith @trailblazers At least the Allen estate won’t have to pay the NBA luxury tax in addition to US capital gains taxes on the roughly 1.1 billion of appreciation since Paul Allen bought the team for $70 million when it sells the team.Bra why @trailblazers trade CJ?  Smh dumbest trade ever.Obviously @trailblazers is rebuilding. If @nyknicks don’t find a way to get @Dame_Lillard then we have failed at this trade deadline.Ben &amp; Anfernee Simmons together would be so sturdy… I DONT SEE WHY NOT @sixers @trailblazers  @Dame_Lillard@trailblazers Nurk for Sabonis do it right nowThe Portland Trail Blazers are trading guard CJ McCollum to the New Orleans Pelicans for multiple players and draft compensation, multiple outlets reported Tuesday. https://t.co/a9tb8c3aqeThe @Pacers doing a better job at rebuilding than the @trailblazers@Cmurrrda_ @PelicansNBA @trailblazers ok so now it’s finalized. how you feel about it fam ?

Attention back on the @Suns 😂😂😂I officially renounce my fandom with the Portland Trail Blazers because I refuse to sit through 10 more years of pseudo-rebuilding like I did with my Mariners. The Blazers need a fundamental change and I’m over it. I will always ride with Dame but bye bye Blazers. Timmy Buns Out.@harrisjalex @CJMcCollum @trailblazers Im a Nuggets fan and went to game 5. Felt great about the series. The. I watched the fourth quarter of this game on my phone in a random Sunday school room at a church at a wedding in Oklahoma.

The Lakers should trade everyone for Dame and there is whatever Hollywood star of Portland’s choice.Does anyone understand what the Portland Trail Blazers are doing? I am thoroughly confused. 🤦🏾‍♀️I don’t usually post about sports, but I have to take a moment to thank @CJMcCollum for all his years with the @trailblazers. One of my favorite fan memories is catching this high-five from him after his epic 37-point, game-closing, series-ending performance in Game 7 in Denver. https://t.co/ndsGH8wbgM@DailyKnicksFS @trailblazers we’ll give you 4 kemba walkers for lillard@SacramentoKings @trailblazers You good?@damianlillard and @3jmccollum never missed the playoffs while playing together.

Resign Simons, then use cap space to sign Brunson and someone“Portland is clearing a bunch of room, and getting a good prospect along with a first-round pick.”

I’m secretly excited about Josh Hart.@trailblazers really has the stupidest GM/ownership in the league. How TF do we trade CJ for absolutely nothing? Just trade Dame at this point so he can go play for a team that wants to win.@BurnerOfNba @trailblazers @OrlandoMagic @ModaCenter @ROOTSPORTS_NW @RipCityRadio620 That’s one young piece? That’s beyond horrible.@Eyyrek @trailblazers I don’t think that’s entirely accurate. There’s some decent talent in this draft.

Growing up as a @trailblazers fan, I’ll never forget the engergy in the arena. Especially when @Lakers came to town. Still a great feeling, even as an adult.If I’m Damian Lillard, I’m not playing another single second for the Portland Trail Blazers.@Dame_Lillard as a lifetime @trailblazers fan of over 30 years, who has grown to love you as the franchise player ahead of Clyde and a better representative of Portland than any city deserves - please go get your chip with Philly, you don't deserve this mess they've created 😭Welcome to Portland Trail Blazers, Josh Hart.

If you trade Simons, or Nurk for nothing next, I might have to take my love for the game elsewhere@AngryLakerFan83 @trailblazers But I can see why maybe they didn’t want to create bigger competition for them by helping either LA teams. Although they did that a few days ago 😂 portland is banking on getting 2 ⭐️ in offseason maybe@Eyyrek @trailblazers Sure there’s a ton of guards available but like I said, if the forward doesn’t come from FA, we’ll be trading picks for them.

There won’t be options to go to destination franchises. Also, trades.@AngryLakerFan83 @trailblazers But portland could have gotten a way better deal honestly from either LA teams. … portland GM is … who knows will see.Interesting trade in the NBA. I think it's a win-win for the Pelicans and the Trail Blazers. CJ McCollum is a great player but his prime is nearly over. Portland is smart to look to the future.

Hit a home run on one of those picks (or trade for someone established), and they could be really good quickly.

Huge risk in all of this. But isn’t risk what Portland fans have screamed for?@1080TheFAN @trailblazers @PelicansNBA A+ Moving on and let’s make a run with Dame and whoever wants to come along!Considering the deals they are doing now @dmorey should have been able to get half the @trailblazers roster for Ben Simmons.

And they can look to the future, please agree @trailblazers 🤣@Osaze316 @trailblazers @Dame_Lillard Apparently they’re swinging for the fences this off-season.

@Lakers @JeanieBuss @trailblazersThis is a bad trade @trailblazers … We just picked up Nance Jr. We trade a 20 ppg player for a 13 ppg player in return and a couple of rotational bench guys. How does this make any sense? I’m gonna miss CJ. Best of luck @CJMcCollum@_thatboycash @trailblazers i’m really sick fr 😭Hey @trailblazers, trading CJ won't lift your curse, and that is what's keeping us from the championship! Worry a little less about trading, a little more about curse lifting.I didn't think this would happen until the off season. I hat to see @CJMcCollum go, but it's an exciting rebuild for the @trailblazers . #RipCity https://t.co/SrdKAwHkciOne day I will be a part owner of the Portland Trail Blazers??@GoldenStaking @trailblazers This is his out imo.

Unexperienced outside shooter here with potential. Willing to work out a deal for a 10 day contract to start.

Blazing a new trail to a new city that’ll be ok with a sh*t team for a few years.It would suck royally to have @trailblazers tickets right now. What a dumpster fire.

Come on!@shummel22 @wojespn @trailblazers Paul Allen is rolling over in his grave.I know Blazer analysts, owners &amp; GM’s talk game &amp; how to win.

Why does Twitter not just ban them?I absolutely despise the business end of sports, but I gotta say that if the @trailblazers want to trade CJ, I support CJ saying “nope”, &amp; retiring to live a happy, wine-making life here in Oregon with his beautiful new baby, &amp; his accomplished, beautiful wife, Dr. McCollum.@trailblazers @Dame_Lillard Sell the team.
