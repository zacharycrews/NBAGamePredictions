Portland Trail Blazers - Miami Heat

Miami Heat Team Total O109.5 Points @ 1.95 ($100)

Portland's defense is simply a joke right now. The Heat went over this team total in 5 of their L7 matches, so I have my faith in them.

I feel the same about curry honestly! All three of these players are generational talents. He should not debate on who’s better. We all know all time lebron is better than these two. Let’s end this right here 😂@CocchiaraSam @DubNationGOAT @petry_jayden @MaskedLBJ @trailblazers My girlfriend and I broke up. We got in a fight because I was always saying how beautiful Lebron is. In the heat of the moment I called her a “Mickey Mouse Girlfriend”and it was a wrap. I thought she was the love of my life. The only thing I talk to now is my LBJ plushie. LBJ=❤️@DubNationGOAT @burner_kostas @petry_jayden @MaskedLBJ @trailblazers The other day I met LeBron James . He somehow had all his rings on him. I decided to give him a diamond test to see if his rings were real. Quite frankly, my diamond tester was going up! But when I asked Jordan, all his rings were fake. Of course JorFRAUD had 0 real rings.@burner_kostas @DubNationGOAT @petry_jayden @MaskedLBJ @trailblazers LeBron is the greatest basketball player of all time. LeBron did everything Jordan did, but better. LeBron made teammates better something Jordan could not do. LeBron is a 4 time NBA champion with each ring proving to be tougher than the last. LeBron is my GOAT and yours as well@CocchiaraSam @burner_kostas @petry_jayden @MaskedLBJ @trailblazers Damn I feel ur pain! Russ is nice and all but he’s not a winner. Trust me they’re not trading damn for WestTurnovers.@CocchiaraSam @DubNationGOAT @petry_jayden @MaskedLBJ @trailblazers LeBron is my idol. Hes the person I aspire to be, hes my light of day.

Sit Dame.

Retool the team.

Contend next year.@BlazerBurner @trailblazers the correlation is you say replace him for a reason then also wanna use him lol the problem is the team does not play defense. need build around dame and ant. not many better options for replacing nurk idk who you think the blazers can get lol@kid_sebi @ovonermin @trailblazers Cavs fanHonestly Dame is tanking his trade value so hard that I’m proposing a straight up THT - Dame trade lmk @trailblazersSignal Pink Dame 6.

“It’s a big club &amp; you ain’t in it” 
- George CarlinThe Portland Trail Blazers are also missing some pieces but it hasn't hurt them too much offensively.  They have scored 103 or more points in nine of their last 10 games overall, including 136 against the Hawks last time out.  They are one of the worst defensive teams in the NBA,For our first #WhatIfWednesday we're taking a look at the 2007 NBA Draft. The Portland Trail Blazers held the first pick of the draft and selected Greg Oden who's career ended up being riddled with injuries. But, what if the Trail Blazers selected Kevin Durant over Greg Oden? https://t.co/MpexdIC5a0The trip continues out west for the @MiamiHEAT facing a struggling @trailblazers team tonight at 10:00 pm. #NBAToday's NBA Picks: 10:10 PM ET - Miami Heat vs. Portland Trail Blazers - 8 PICKS AVAILABLE: https://t.co/JQHMmHzkbb #nba@TheAthleticNBA @sam_amick @trailblazers wake upDasHaus made a bet!

Enjoy it!@PNW_working_mom @KGWNews @trailblazers @NBA @ModaCenter Are we going to live in panic forever? This is nonsense! 😡@GaryGoatJr @trailblazers CJ is waaayy better at hogging the ball and taking horrible shots than Ant. Same goes for Lillard. Portland is going nowhere with Lillard n CJ , they're the biggest ball hogging backcourt in the NBA@catrenzer @trailblazers Thank you Catherine - not the way I planned it, but nowadays what works like we think it will lol??? (and these kids are running me ragged 😂 - don't tell them that tho 🙊😉)@tcbbiggs @trailblazers Thanks, Team Mom!!!@blazercollector @trailblazers That sounds like a fantastic retirement plan. Those kids will keep you young! Congrats &amp; happy belated birthday!Hello @trailblazers faithful - Happy New Year!

Lots of news from "Blazer Acres South" (as my cousin calls it 😂), lets start here: as of 12/29, my orthopedist has deemed my broken foot healed enough to return to "normal life" (whatever that is 🤷🤔) - but hooray!
