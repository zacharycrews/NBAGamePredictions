Really bad defense by Washington all night.Wizards took another L last night against Golden State 126-112. Steph had 47, Klay had 20, and Poole had 20 for the Warriors. Porzingis had 25 and KCP had 19 for Washington. The Wizards next game is tomorrow at 7pm against the Nuggets. Who will win?The Washington Wizards are not a real basketball team.
