Day 25 of tweeting @SacramentoKings that Richaun is the GOAT until they follow back. #RichaunforAllStar@SacramentoKings @Verizon @swipathefox @buddyhield @hbarnes @moe_harkless @Rich_Holmes22 How many guards does it take to change a lightbulb?I felt like this for awhile and I am glad their is an article on it but Louis king needs a roster spot with Sacramento kings 
Woodard needs to be on the 2way

https://t.co/KcGZ0NpdyK@Jakewantsanap @HoopsTalk13 That's fair, but Luka's agent avoided Sacramento and look at them now. Bagley was the only one who openly said he wanted to play for the Kings and they gave up on him

My point being unless they're pulling an Eli Manning you take the player you want to takeThe Suns look to make it five straight wins in Sacramento against the Kings.

Love and Appreciate you! #LetGoKingsSacramento is 5-1 when they shoot at least 33% from three-point range.

As we saw last night vs Indiana, when the triples aren't falling, the night is probably not going to go the Kings' way.

Living and dying by the three early in the season. https://t.co/4hWdvF455o@bwagzburner @thejschweigert Thanks. I don't give up on my teams....I mean I'm an Oakland A's &amp; Sacramento Kings fan they haven't been great but I still love them.Not even 48 hours after the team's most impressive performance of the season, the Sacramento Kings fell flat on Sunday during an underwhelming loss to Indiana.

The Kings will look to get back on track tonight against the Deandre Ayton-less Phoenix Suns:
https://t.co/bdW2W9Rrpt@P1ASAP @veskovic_nikola @NBA @SacramentoKings Huh? He had a nearly 3.5 to 1 assist to TO rate averaging 5.3 assists per game over his career so idk what the fuck you’re talking about saying he needs to chill with the turnovers.@HeuristicLineup I visit Sacramento a lot from Boise ID, if lower level tickets weren’t so damn high I’d go. I drove 4 hours to Utah because i got a ticket for $39 10 rows behind the kings bench$100 in Barnes paid out $5954 in 9 games 🔥

Are you picking him tonight when the Kings face the Suns?

I like Tobias &amp; horford can still be productive but idk if that's ideal for SacIf you look around the NBA, there are teams that were terrible for years.

The Orlando Magic, Charlotte Hornets, Sacramento Kings and for around 6 years, the Phoenix Suns were terrible.

#NBA https://t.co/w7GhD7QJ1u@A237654 @MarkJonesESPN @SacramentoKings @kayte_c I'm only upset about Luke's decision making at the end of games. Their best lineup last night was when fox was not on the floor. A disciplined coach may have benched him for the last 5 minutes of the game. Love fox but he was not as efficient as hali and mitchel last night.I think its coaching... @SacramentoKings  @mmcnairToday in Sports History:
1988 - Arco Arena opens in Sacramento. The @SacramentoKings lose to the @SeattleSonics 97-75 in inaugural game.

https://t.co/8aV3wHCvcQ@grantcohn Can you hit up the Sacramento Kings for me big dog? We got Luke Walton that has NEVER had a winning season but NOBODY in the media will whisper his name as the problem 🤬 Thanks in advanceLuke Walton drew up a good play end of the game for @SacramentoKings.Barnes was option #1. After what he did vs Cleveland last year and vs the Suns this season. @kayte_c called it. Pacers denied him the ball and Haliburton ,the inbounder, became option #2.That’s basketball 🤷🏽‍♂️NextKings are 5-5 after 10 games. Last year, they were 4-6. In four of those losses, they got blown out. We're not seeing it this year. They're more competitive and simply better. Go Kings! @CarmichaelDave @kayte_c @MirannLolani @FCartoscelli3 @SacramentoKings@matuts22 @NBA @SacramentoKings Lol we lost by 3 you acting like it wasn't a good game.
