ESPN Insider Bobby Marks highlights this in the column for Detroit as the “Trade we would like to see: Grant to the Grizzlies for Kyle Anderson, Brandon Clarke, Jarrett Culver and two first-round picks (Jazz and Warriors).”@johntollll @memgrizz @jarenjacksonjr This is why team rebound rate is a better stat than individual rebounds.

I’ll let you figure which one is which out yourself. 

One hint tho the one looking at a top 4 seed has a top 5 easiest schedule the rest of the way 😘@memgrizz @jarenjacksonjr He has the worst shot selection@HalaLakers @Mohamed83350821 @memgrizz @Lakers I promise you my son you’re the only one in this convo who cares. You’re just like a Yankees fan yelling 27 rings. Hanging on to past glory because it all you have. It’s a cute bit. But it’s just as pathetic.@HalaLakers @Mohamed83350821 @memgrizz @Lakers Same franchise that traded us the rights to the way better gasol brother for pau. Goes both ways lol@jclyde21 @Mohamed83350821 @memgrizz @Lakers got more rings than your franchise@jclyde21 @Mohamed83350821 @memgrizz @Lakers lol you have no future man. winning regular season games is not a future. titles or bust. imagine thinking when the lakers have 80m roll off in 2 years they dont have a future.

THE HORROR. OH HOW WILL I EVER RECOVER FROM LETTING DION WAITERS SLIP THROUGH OUR FINGERS.@jclyde21 @Mohamed83350821 @memgrizz @Lakers na we just decided to put you as a grizzly fan in your place and remind you where you stand in the hierarchy of the NBA.  A poverty franchise near the bottom. A team that cant even come close to filling their stadium. Sad team to be honest.Memphis Grizzlies on some proper 9-1 form RN, meanwhile, Warriors, Phoenix and Jazz are struggling-ish.@Mohamed83350821 @HalaLakers @memgrizz @Lakers I never said there was a rivalry? Y’all the one mad about some standard after game trolling and I’m just egging it on 😭😭😭@HalaLakers @Mohamed83350821 @memgrizz @Lakers Meh. That’ll change sooner rather than later I ain’t pressed. You, however, are still mad about losing a game in January and the trolling from it two days after the fact lmao I’m just here to egg you on til I fall asleep cause it’s funny to me tbh@Mohamed83350821 @jclyde21 @memgrizz @Lakers Their hope is they get moved so they can be in a bigger market that attracts talent. They are a feeder team to big teams.@jclyde21 @HalaLakers @memgrizz @Lakers Jay, There is no rivalry between Grizzlies and the Lakers 😂 your team is trying to make one now, you are just like the Clippers, very small team compared to us with no history and future@jclyde21 @Mohamed83350821 @memgrizz @Lakers lol bro https://t.co/RQRh9Z9EKc@jclyde21 @Mohamed83350821 @memgrizz @Lakers Maybe in 2k you can make the grizz win a playoff series https://t.co/oUYEePQaSG@jclyde21 @Mohamed83350821 @memgrizz @Lakers Yall aint ever even win a division title. 27 total franchise playoff wins. https://t.co/Dmo8z41f2N@jclyde21 @Mohamed83350821 @memgrizz @Lakers ja morant a loser in college and a loser now. https://t.co/d4MuMmRgsD@Mohamed83350821 @HalaLakers @memgrizz @Lakers Well, Mohamed, you kinda have to win January to get to that position in the first place lol@jclyde21 @Mohamed83350821 @memgrizz @Lakers crown em. regular season champ!@PatrickMahomes The Memphis Grizzlies remind me of OKC when they were young and each year progress was made. Don’t be shocked if they win the West next year and Cleveland within 2-3 years. Crazy as it sounds.@HalaLakers @Mohamed83350821 @memgrizz @Lakers “Mediocracy”

I think you meant mediocrity there my son. Anywho. https://t.co/McvmNIEOtB@jclyde21 @HalaLakers @memgrizz @Lakers Your team celebrates wins in January and we celebrate championships see the difference 😂@HalaLakers @Mohamed83350821 @memgrizz @Lakers And still will go farther than the Lakers this postseason ESPECIALLY if Old Man Bron don’t get help and you waste another year of the greatest player on earth.@jclyde21 @Mohamed83350821 @memgrizz @Lakers Lebron was reminding him that he could send him to China. Bane piped down. Also lol at Lakers fans being toxic when admin for your small market team post like the above. Enjoy mediocracy.@HalaLakers @Mohamed83350821 @memgrizz @Lakers It’s over 80 trust me 😘@jclyde21 @Mohamed83350821 @memgrizz @Lakers glad weve established the reason we started this convo. poverty franchise that celebrates the regular season.  Glad you came around. still cant believe you thought 79.6% was higher than 80%. hopefully your office job doesnt require basic math.@HalaLakers @Mohamed83350821 @memgrizz @Lakers I’ll take that as a compliment because I’d rather be a small market fan proud of my team and city than a toxic big market fan still punching air over a team that I got beat by 2 days ago 😭😭😭@HalaLakers @Mohamed83350821 @memgrizz @Lakers I ain’t trusting the NBA to either honestly.@CHawks901 @memgrizz @Lakers Congratulations on a season win... Hope your team win a banner...@HalaLakers @Mohamed83350821 @memgrizz @Lakers You’re like 5 years behind 🥱 Robert para killed the moving rumor when he decided to keep his majority stake and not sell off. But tell yourself whatever you need to cope with 3 losses to a “poverty franchise” this season my son. 😘@jclyde21 @Mohamed83350821 @memgrizz @Lakers hopefully increase the one win yall have over the last few years. you even root like a small market fan. kinda hilarious.@jclyde21 @Mohamed83350821 @memgrizz @Lakers So you are a more credible source than fedex arena and the nba? Dawg you can’t do basic math. No offense. I ain’t trusting you to count to ten.@HalaLakers @Mohamed83350821 @memgrizz @Lakers Meh 26 years old bout right for an expansion team that just found consistent success within the last decade and got its first playoff win only a decade ago tbh. Sounds solid. Proud of em. There’s MANY more to come.@NBA @memgrizz @Raptors We’ll deserved@HalaLakers @jclyde21 @memgrizz @Lakers Dwight Howard has more playoff wins than the entire Grizzlies team 😂@jclyde21 @Mohamed83350821 @memgrizz @Lakers to be honest Grizz are gonna move. If FedEx Forum's paid attendance falls below 14,900, 64 of the largest suites are not sold in full, or the club level season tickets fall below 2,500, the contract triggers an option to break the lease. Owner has inquired about moving. tic toc@HalaLakers @Mohamed83350821 @memgrizz @Lakers And the NBA is stupid and wants to pump numbers by using standing room numbers that doesn’t exist so they aren’t credible either lol@HalaLakers @Mohamed83350821 @memgrizz @Lakers Meh you’ve also been around since like world war 2. You want a cookie or something lol? You’ve been around longer than the sports been desegregated or even athletic I’d HOPE you have some titles from those eras lol@jclyde21 @Mohamed83350821 @memgrizz @Lakers You have 27 total playoff wins…. in franchise history. https://t.co/zGuIq1i0u6@jclyde21 @Mohamed83350821 @memgrizz @Lakers We have more titles this decade than you have division titles in franchise history.@HalaLakers @Mohamed83350821 @memgrizz @Lakers Now say it with a straight face and no tears of anger in your eyes lol@jclyde21 @Mohamed83350821 @memgrizz @Lakers Im legit using the number the NBA is using. You are not a credible source.@HalaLakers @Mohamed83350821 @memgrizz @Lakers Taking Wikipedia over a firsthand source is nasty work but believe what you want man. I know how Memphis is with the grizzlies you don’t lol@jclyde21 @Mohamed83350821 @memgrizz @Lakers Wiki and fedex arena list basketball @ 18119. Fans dont support the Grizz. plain and simple. perhaps they cannot afford games. based on your tweets yall have a lower COL which ought to equate to disposable income. So it seems like a choice. Sad but true of poverty franchises.@HalaLakers @Mohamed83350821 @memgrizz @Lakers See you within 5-8 years 😘 https://t.co/DQb2kJOVxS@HalaLakers @Mohamed83350821 @memgrizz @Lakers NBA is wrong cause that’s borderline a fire violation when including Forum staff lmao@jclyde21 @Mohamed83350821 @memgrizz @Lakers Ja is steve francis 2.0. Will never win a title and relies on pure athleticism and gets hurt every year. Fun to watch but quickly fades when he cant jump anymore. JA will never win an NBA title as the #1 option. He will need someone to carry him. Pass on JA.@jclyde21 @Mohamed83350821 @memgrizz @Lakers NBA is using an 18395 number as max capacity. Great how math works.Had a blast in LA with my fam. @LAClippers vs @memgrizz game woulda been more lit if ja woulda played but atleast I got to pull out the vintage Nike @55buckets swingman. 😂🤣😂 https://t.co/7UJG8FXrF3@HalaLakers @Mohamed83350821 @memgrizz @Lakers Man you can only pray Ja finds his way into a Lakers jersey because maybe they’ll be good again when Lebron can’t carry ‘em anymore and retires or goes to play Age 40 seasons with Bronny. 

But after what Ja has said about sending Laker fans home sad I don’t he wants that 😘@NBA @memgrizz @Raptors Ja Morant did that 🎯@jclyde21 @Mohamed83350821 @memgrizz @Lakers your stadium is on average 20% empty.   Our season ticket waitlist is 8 years. take the l. congrats on being a small market team. maybe one day one on the current roster will play for a big city team. https://t.co/zYE3mnyRs7@HalaLakers @Mohamed83350821 @memgrizz @Lakers I can guarantee you as a season ticket holder that 18119 is when it doesn’t have up scaffolding for in game entertainment. 18119 is basically the concert venue number. It’s more around 17900-18k when set up for Grizz/Tigers games@jclyde21 @Mohamed83350821 @memgrizz @Lakers lol right.@HalaLakers @Mohamed83350821 @memgrizz @Lakers Still a better atmosphere every damn game and that’s what matters. A full stadium that’s on their phones or worried about the gram post don’t mean shit. Memphis fans wanna be there for the game and they’re engaged cause it’s by far the city’s fav sport &amp; that’s why it’s better 🤷🏻‍♀️@jclyde21 @Mohamed83350821 @memgrizz @Lakers More than 3k off max capacity. Max capacity is 18,119. 3477 is rather large when your maximum is 18,119. Especially when Memphis has the 4th most affordable ticket according to studies. People just don’t attend games and thats ok.@jclyde21 @Mohamed83350821 @memgrizz @Lakers it really does sometimes 😂😂😂@Westbrook0_SZN @Mohamed83350821 @memgrizz @Lakers I forget sometimes cause NBA Twitter feel like it’s a bunch of 12 year olds daily my b 😭😭😭@jclyde21 @Mohamed83350821 @memgrizz @Lakers We can keep going if you want. But its a factual statement that fans do not attend games in Memphis. One of worst home attendances in NBA.  The attendance is also currently below 80%.@HalaLakers @Mohamed83350821 @memgrizz @Lakers Meh missing less than 3k average from capacity nbd and if you think it’s a big deal you’re splitting hairs honestly lol. Still louder than crypto whenever the lakers or clippers play this season 🌚🌚🌚@jclyde21 @Mohamed83350821 @memgrizz @Lakers 79.6% is in fact not above 80%@jclyde21 @Mohamed83350821 @memgrizz @Lakers I’ve seen 6, not everyone on this app is fucking 9 💀💀💀@jclyde21 @Mohamed83350821 @memgrizz @Lakers I live in california, on a beach.

Cause you live in LA lol.@jclyde21 @Mohamed83350821 @memgrizz @Lakers lol jesus christ. Memphis is a singular city. there in fact is only one place where fans who live in memphis can watch games. go try again.@SwollenDome @howaboutafresca If the @memgrizz win tonight against the warriors they will be the 3 seed in the west. They were projected a .500 win team. If they stay healthy tonight is a WCF preview.@HalaLakers @Mohamed83350821 @memgrizz @Lakers Did YOU graduate high school cause that quite literally is above 80% attendance 😭😭😭 https://t.co/LzCKic0OkM@jclyde21 @Mohamed83350821 @memgrizz @Lakers you have a less than 80% fan attendance. Did you graduate high school?@HalaLakers @Mohamed83350821 @memgrizz @Lakers Nah I work an office job and make decent pay while in school but there’s nothing wrong with working for FedEx or Walmart. Tells me a lot about how shitty a person you are for looking down on someone for working a more physically intensive job tho. Be blessed. Has to suck.the memphis grizzlies lowkey got a nice li squad hold up@HalaLakers @Mohamed83350821 @memgrizz @Lakers Or it’s because we have one of the smallest stadiums in the league so we’re at an inherent disadvantage with ticket numbers but I didn’t expect you to put in work finding that out. You’re a Lebron fan after all.“hUmBLe LeBRoN”.
