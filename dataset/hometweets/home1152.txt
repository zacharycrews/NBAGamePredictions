#LEGENDoftheMiamiHEAT #NBA75@BraedenSteele02 @_Allen_Reihman_ @rudygobert27 @celtics @utahjazz @BucketsONeale00 @epaschall Smart is definitely number 2 or 3 depending on if you want to put rob williams ahead of him. Giannis is a close 4th@BraedenSteele02 @_Allen_Reihman_ @rudygobert27 @celtics @utahjazz @BucketsONeale00 @epaschall Of course. Smart is phenomenal at what he does. It just is not as valuable as what Gobert does. Especially in the regular season. That's the argument for gobert.

2. Bulls
7. Celtics
26. Raptors
28. 76ers

Based off this, seems likely Bulls avoid playin but East Playoffs ends up:

Toronto Raptors (#5) vs Boston Celtics (#4)
Chicago Bulls (#6) vs Philadelphia 76ers (#3)Looking very likely at this point that the Chicago Bulls will play either the Philadelphia 76ers or Boston Celtics in the 1st Round of the Playoffs. 

Based on remaining schedules, East standings is shaping up to look like this:

1a. Milwaukee
1b. Miami
3. Philadelphia

He’s the best of the 4 but they’re all rated higher than him. Yes I’m a biased Celtics fan. Shut up.@MaineCeltics @NBT_Bank @denzelvalentine Really Nice game  but not the game  Matt Ryan 
Had ! Ryan is  easily player of the game !
Best all around player on Maine celtics 
Boston Celtics should use him, sign him , do something,  Should've put a Ring on it !
By signing Ryan NOW@SemiSwolejeleye @Danny_Perry @jdogman66 @celtics @FCHWPO To support the team?  Most teams have their players travel with the team if they are able to travel even if they are injured.  When Harden &amp; Embiid didn't play in Miami they traveled with the team.  Typically Celtics players do the same, but they didn't specifically in Toronto@Danny_Perry @SemiSwolejeleye @celtics @FCHWPO he doesnt need to its own  buisness nobody else@SemiSwolejeleye @Danny_Perry @jdogman66 @celtics @FCHWPO I don’t - but you couple that with the Celtics not bringing the players in question into Toronto when questionable players usually travel with the team even on a back to back, and the back-room chatter and there’s a lot of smoke.@NolimitImraan 1. we're not a big market
2. we don't have a great record. 

once we get into the top 6/top half they'll have to talk about us more. Just like the Boston Celtics, no one was talking about them at the beginning of the year, but since they have been going on that run, people did.@_derekmartinez7 @HecBreezo @IamJulito Once again clueless. The Reason why the Boston Celtics are defending better because there MAX PLAYERS ARE MAKING AN EFFORT TO PLAY DEFENSE THIS YEAR. THERE MAKING THE PLAYERS AROUND THEM BETTER. AND THERE COACH KNOWS HOW TO MAKE ADJUSTMENTS DURING GAMES. 🙄🙄🙄@SemiSwolejeleye @jdogman66 @celtics @FCHWPO Hey, Jaylen, if you're actually vaccinated, here's your opportunity to speak up and state it for the record. I'm not holding my breath, though...@NBATV @celtics You clinched the playoffs on your day off!?!@SemiSwolejeleye @jdogman66 @celtics @FCHWPO When Brown states "I think it's a personal decision" when asked if vaccinated, that's pretty telling, no? If the playoffs were to start today, the C's would play the Raptors.

The ESPN source is more recent, so I trust that more. Plus, when asked if any players would be impacted in a potential Toronto series, the C's said "no comment." If all players were vaccinated, they would have said so.@NBA2K @Suns @celtics @MiamiHEAT @warriors Tatum should be a 94@WojBombss @HunterCeltics @NBA2K @Suns @celtics @MiamiHEAT @warriors nah if u was like “couldn’t win it for kevin garnett” it’d be fine but u just weird@NBA2K @Suns @celtics @MiamiHEAT @warriors Poole should be 83-84 &amp; Wiggins 81@BolWrld @NBA2K @Suns @celtics @MiamiHEAT @warriors No Butler and Tatum should switch overalls@WojBombss @HunterCeltics @NBA2K @Suns @celtics @MiamiHEAT @warriors Last I checked it’s within 10 decades 😂😂😂@OfficialColinJ @NBA2K @Suns @celtics @MiamiHEAT @warriors he's having a down year and when you compare him to the other 90s he's not close.

I'm just asking@KingdomOfJT_0 @Heat4life01 @NBA2K @Suns @celtics @MiamiHEAT @warriors Right back at ya@ItzWildyy @NBA2K @Suns @celtics @MiamiHEAT @warriors Should be at least a 94 or 95, only players that have been better than him this years on a reasonable sample are Jokic, Embiid, Giannis, Curry, Lebron and they’re all 96+@NBA2K @Suns @celtics @MiamiHEAT @warriors TATUM IS BETTER THAN BUTLER🤡🤡🤡@Gregory03616840 @celtics Ironic when the Celtics played not good players@Gregory03616840 @celtics Crazy u can’t show me rings won in the 21th century@PlayoffBoundNYK @NBA2K @Suns @celtics @MiamiHEAT @warriors Because of ThibsI cannot emphasize how big of a win that was for the Miami Heat against the Boston Celtics last night. They moved up 4 places in my power rankings. The Celtics are struggling to adapt without Robert Williams.
