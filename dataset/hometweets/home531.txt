Let’s run it@jovanbuha This team is looking a lot like Houston rockets of 2019-20. They won't be able to get as much offensive rebounds as they used to the past 2 years. Ceiling for this team is the 2nd round i think if they shoot very well.Not going to truly panic until I read Tilman Fertitta’s name linked to the Flames.
