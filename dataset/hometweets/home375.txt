If every shooter in the league was taking as many threes as Harden, almost all of their averages would go down. The fact that he has maintained above average efficiency on his level of volume is impressiveGolden State Warriors vs Portland Trail Blazers

https://t.co/QJtnoqxmjj@NBA @StephenCurry30 @warriors If he set a new all time record for threes in a game to take the record that would be fucking crazy.

I'm more leaning to the Milwaukee Bucks 🏆🏆@Samueldmerchant @statmuse @warriors @WarriorsPR Of course I’m not saying Lonzo is Steph curry.

So let's say he puts up 24 3's, he'd need to be hitting at 70% accuracy for 16 made.

For perspective - when he hit his career high 13 3s - he was 13 of 17 = 76%.

https://t.co/rZQ7eI56qMGolden State Warriors star Steph Curry is a little coy when asked if he thinks he can hit 16 3-pointers against the Portland Trailblazers at their game Wednesday, which would tie Ray Allen's record for most from distance in an NBA career. https://t.co/FcLivIUUpp@warriors Curry 1

#DubNation https://t.co/13qwKQapFi@warriors Kevon is looking really looney lol@NBA @StephenCurry30 @warriors Lets be real...

There's only been two KINDS of greatness in basketball:
1. MJ's greatness
2. Curry's greatness

MJ doesn't fit under curry's greatness and curry doesn't fit under MJ's.

Kobe,bron,kd,shaq,kareem,duncun and all come under MJ's shadow BUT there's still none under👨‍🍳@Sosablazin95 @NBA @StephenCurry30 @warriors Only 2 players who are actually capable, he is one of them (11 is the other). The only thing that has stopped this from happening already, is basic circumstantial math - 14 3s is 42 pts (min.), and that usually means (esp for GS) the game is not competitive = mins. nor required.@warriors @NBCSAuthentic @espn @957thegame I love it!Toronto Raptors - Oklahoma City Thunder
Houston Rockets - Brooklyn Nets

They're actually in the playoff hunt instead of being locked into being shit until Wiggins's contract ran out.@alxocity @rippackscity @nbatopshot @warriors @sfgov HAPPY BIRTHDAY @alxocity!!!

I was hoping to see you at the last pack party so I could give you a birthday gift, maybe next time! 🎂@BriantheTaxMan @YaibaBeats @statmuse @warriors @WarriorsPR They saw that very off-season PG/Westbrook and AD force their way out still with years left on their contracts. We've seen harden and Simmons since put their teams in unwinnable situation by forcing their way out of their contracts. You think KAT couldn't do the same?Compared to @warriors &amp; @Suns  seems like other @NBA teams just stand around &amp; watch players go 1 on 1 with little ball movement or back cuts. This is what separates Dubs &amp; Suns frm rest of pack they continually hav player &amp; ball movement. While other teams seem like statues #NBA@warriors why yall tickets so expensive??

Big Diesel prediction 🔥🔥@azeecsgo @YaibaBeats @statmuse @warriors @WarriorsPR I wouldn't have caved to Kat when he had multiple years left on his contract. 

I wouldn't have forced a trade by giving picks to a team in the warriors to get rid of an asset at its absolute bottom.

With the benefit of hindsight, how exactly are the wolves better?@icetraelatte @pompomduar @NBA @warriors He’s done that during real games@warriors @Oracle I’m so happy for my team@BriantheTaxMan @YaibaBeats @statmuse @warriors @WarriorsPR So you would've kept his 18 ppg on 41/34/70 splits and no defense on a max contract on the team while you weren't winning shit?

Wiggins was really bad his last 2 years on the wolves. He is now really good on the warriors. That wouldn't have happened if he was still in Minnesota.@azeecsgo @YaibaBeats @statmuse @warriors @WarriorsPR I wouldn't have traded him.@DDDGURU @SteinmetzNBA @warriors Guru with the 🌊🌊🌊🌊@OleKingNole @KlayThompson @warriors @SteveKerr Thank you!Check out this listing I just added to my #Poshmark closet: Golden State Warriors GSW NBA Fleece Fabric Logo. https://t.co/3lwjcEFAra #shopmycloset @poshmarkapp@BriantheTaxMan @YaibaBeats @statmuse @warriors @WarriorsPR I mean, he might. But it was basically guaranteed if they didn't get dlo, who is his best friend in the NBA.

Alright let me put it to you this way if you think dlo wasn't worth Wiggins and a pick. How would you have gotten Wiggins off that team if you're the wolves GM?@tonyflorimon @ShamsCharania @bkravitz @TheAthletic @warriors So you are saying we now have 3 centers?

Steph bro, a room just for your BAYC.@cdg1228 @ClutchPointsApp @NBAMemes @warriors But it’s a stretch apparently. You hiding behind semantics but ight. Hope you feel okay next time Lebron does something in his spare time that makes your skin crawl weirdo. 😂😂@alvan_hamangaba @warriors @StephenCurry30 Send please@isoroomnft @warriors @ChaseCenter @StephenCurry30 @StephenCurry30 @ChaseCenter @warriors 

First an Isoroom, Next up an IsoLockeroom for Champions!

@Richimond_san @FirebuddyC @neon12samuraiSteph (@warriors ) I’m sorry I had to go darker, meaghan good was always a star,  I love to see her sparkle.@JYuter Like perhaps the Rally Rabbi at the Golden State Warriors game the other day  😂 https://t.co/X0CFciKrW2@statmuse As a longtime Mavs fan since 1980, we can't let Kristaps Porzingis suffers from those losses. We need to bring a real scorer like Chris Chiozza from Golden State by trading washed Luka Doncic to the Warriors to pair him with franchise player Kristaps PorzingisFun little #StephCurry design!
Man’s been popping off!!! 
#smsports @warriors https://t.co/s8qS0SjCmi@BartAndBaileyGM @warriors I didn’t research this the way I did my master’s thesis but it seems you are correct that there are incredible similarities between the two injuries and it makes me relieved there’s some normalcy here. I’m talking about this on @LockedOnDubs tomorrow, thanks!@BriantheTaxMan @YaibaBeats @statmuse @warriors @WarriorsPR It's not like they're well run, and giving Wiggins that max was a terrible idea anyway, but the trade for dlo was about as good as they were going to get. If they didn't trade him it's likely kat would've just guaranteed left, so the trade they made was alright.@isoroomnft @warriors @ChaseCenter @StephenCurry30 :thinking: @TowerDAO@DailyDoseOfZack @ClutchPointsApp @NBAMemes @warriors Nowhere did I say "nobody gives him criticism".

I can see that you have reading comprehension issues so I am done with this conversation.

✌️✌️✌️@YaibaBeats @BriantheTaxMan @statmuse @warriors @WarriorsPR To be fair they couldn't exactly utilise him how he's used now. For the warriors he plays an off ball non decision making role where he just cuts, plays d, shoots and drives. For the wolves he basically had to play primary ball handler and score in isolation, which hurt his d too@wtfgaily @warriors This is the best thing I’ve seen so far 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂@AshleyBelling2 @sorryboy1 @warriors @Oracle Perhaps coz it was a question from a journalist 🤷‍♀️The home of the San Jose Sharks, the SAP Center, and the Golden State Warrior's arena, the Chase Center, have new COVID protocols for children. https://t.co/srskwI9cr9 https://t.co/nysGMNaaRr
