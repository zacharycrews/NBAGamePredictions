https://t.co/dYEEwV7pFm.@rodboone joined @WilliePStyle today as he looked at the @hornets collapse against the @Timberwolves, and if the All-Star break can help the Hornets regroup for the homestretch of the season.

Listen Here: https://t.co/1tqAkjOZu8“Look at the hypocrisy. The Charlotte Hornets play unmasked while our children are forced to play the same game with masks. Citizens of every age are allowed to sit maskless at a restaurant to eat their meal but the same rule does not apply to the school desk.” - Maggie Franklin@byMikeDavis You 100% need to tune in to a Charlotte hornets game with their home commentators...#MIAvsCHA 

Who will win?

#LEGENDoftheMiamiHEAT #NBA75@CheesyOmega @Pajita06 @david08076439 @hornets -ly the dumbest shit I’ve ever heard@n8shin @Pajita06 @david08076439 @hornets The rest is truthful@n8shin @Pajita06 @david08076439 @hornets That was an obvious troll@CheesyOmega @Pajita06 @david08076439 @hornets LMFAOO Anthony edwards fans are a science experiment I swear@n8shin @Pajita06 @david08076439 @hornets Damn he’s great at statpadding@CheesyOmega @Pajita06 @david08076439 @hornets No shit bro, but you’re out here claiming ant would be better if he had the bench lamelo had when lamelo drops 38 6 and 9 vs Boston and 33 9 and 5 vs Chicago and then loses both games. You just sound stupid@CheesyOmega @Pajita06 @david08076439 @hornets And that’s every game yes, timberwolves fan, tell me what the hornets are like@n8shin @Pajita06 @david08076439 @hornets Last night your bench was keeping you in the game, same for the game  before that. Y’all lost both because your best players stunk it up@CheesyOmega @Pajita06 @david08076439 @hornets Oh our bench guys, that’s right@n8shin @Pajita06 @david08076439 @hornets Damn, if only y’all had an All-star that could step up in the absence of Gordon Hayward. 
Y’all missing Hayward isn’t having that big of an effect on your team, you guys just haven’t been playing well@CheesyOmega @Pajita06 @david08076439 @hornets 2-8 in our last 10, totally fine@n8shin @Pajita06 @david08076439 @hornets You’re literally missing one of your best players and y’all doing fine lmao@Fademe218 @hornets @Timberwolves Its so annoying thats why i gotta quit for a while or forever lolChill on my @hornets we bout to shake back https://t.co/AJOcP4pVAd#NBAAllStar and @hornets guard @MELOD1P will release a "Rick and Morty" themed colorway for his @PUMA signature shoe MB.01 👟

How @MilesBridges defense has really stepped up. Dude guarding Steph, Giannis and everyone in between. He needs to get more recognition for that. Not alot of people can guard 1-5. #charlottehornetsThanks @PJWashington and @hornets  for the shout-out to Black History, Willie Stratford and the Charlotte YMCA! #Legacy3C https://t.co/AjV6fBR1C8@AlexisC38698559's account is temporarily unavailable because it violates the Twitter Media Policy.
