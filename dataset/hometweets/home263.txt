LA Lakers without James tonight in New York against the Knicks. 

🏀 Knicks cover -5.5 spread (-110)
🏀 O/U: Under (214.5)

Let us know what you think of T's picks. 👇

#NewYorkForever #LakeShow #NBA75 #NBATwitter #sportsbetting https://t.co/wr72PJnxA0@NBAonTNT @Lakers @nyknicks @russwest44 @J30_RANDLE Is Dolan still keeping Spike and Mr Oakley locked outside?@eugenejohnson_ I dig all of those ideas.

Especially Toppin, who, coincidentally, I wanted the Bulls to steer clear of a couple years ago.

But with the way he’s helped boost New York’s bench unit, it’s hard to see the Knicks parting ways with him.Uniform for tonight’s @nyknicks game with some of the other @KongcreteBaller founders.

Ingram was the Reason i wanted the Lakers trade for AD.No #LeBronJames tonite at The Garden for #Lakers BUT #melo is back!
Didn’t work out the way #Knicks hoped when Dolan traded every good player on the team to get him from Denver.

https://t.co/xjIs9Kpghz https://t.co/T69srWRw6y@Top5PelicansPod @SwinCash @dg_riff @tralang_21 @nyknicks You're really trying to create that Duke roster, aren't you? Lol. NYK can keep RJ. That's not the move.@brett_diet @SwinCash @dg_riff @tralang_21 @nyknicks Im Fine With Bottoming out.
And Starting over.

But your definitely Right about ingrams injury probably playing big part in what we are seeing in him right now.@knickjunkie @IanBegley @SBondyNYDN @AshNicoleMoss Uh, the Knicks are STARTING a career -126 Point Guard

over a PROVEN #MVP Point Guard who is +533 in his career.

A career in which he's been held back/playing behind lessor (far lessor) Point Guards.

That's the @nyknicks biggest mistake.@Top5PelicansPod @SwinCash @dg_riff @tralang_21 @nyknicks I would be shocked if bis bad play ain’t related to the injury that’s why I’m not gonna overreact and trade him. Wait n see how the rest of the season goes before trading him. Others like Kira, naw, hayes etc should def be traded immediately@nyknicks Tonight should be fun with the black jerseys!!@mhof314 @SwinCash @dg_riff @tralang_21 @nyknicks It is in a way.
But if Ingrams on a Max...
And pels still the Worst team in the league?
Im fine getting out of that contract.

Alec Burks is an underrated part of that deal.@Top5PelicansPod @SwinCash @dg_riff @tralang_21 @nyknicks I don’t want to trade a max guy who actually wants to be here. He’s been injured to start this year out. We know he’s a 25-5-5 guy. It’s less about reuniting them and more about not trying to bottom out even further at this point.New York Knicks...today is my Birthday. I ask that you please handle business tonight against the Lakers so that I may cap of the night and continue it with my celebration. Happy Birthday to me.@CheckUpBBallYT @nyknicks @NBAonTNT @BetMGM That would be hella intimidating too. I like it@nyknicks @NBAonTNT @BetMGM We can’t lose with this new court and jersey@Top5PelicansPod @SwinCash @dg_riff @tralang_21 @nyknicks Nah my man I gotta disagree w u. We need a lot more. Barrett has been awful this season as well. I feel like the move would be forced to appease zion@mhof314 @SwinCash @dg_riff @tralang_21 @nyknicks Not much more.
Add My Guy Alec Burks
And get a mid-Late Unprotected 1st from the knicks.
🤝🏿
Enough for me@nyknicks We need a FACILITATOR!@brett_diet @SwinCash @dg_riff @tralang_21 @nyknicks With Ingram we are 3-16?

Give Me Zions Brother RJ.
And Start the Rebuild.

I cant Believe theres so much push Back on reuniting RJ n Zion@IanBegley @SBondyNYDN @AshNicoleMoss @nyknicks should've
1.  Resigned @drose to be the STARTING POINT GUARD

2.  Signed @nunnbetter_  to backup #drose &amp; spot start when DRose rests

3.  Sign @DeMar_DeRozan 

This isn't in hindsight.  I was SCREAMING for these moves.@Top5PelicansPod @SwinCash @dg_riff @tralang_21 @nyknicks We better get more than just rj@NBAonTNT @Lakers @nyknicks @russwest44 @J30_RANDLE Bing bong loadingMy gut tells me @KembaWalker is going to have his breakout game soon, and once he gets that, he will fit perfectly with the @nyknicks.

But even if he hasn't, he is still a great player for the team with his positive vibes.

Carmelo Anthony will win his one and only NBA championship ring as a Knick. 
Good to see ya Me7o! https://t.co/QhEtnwhHEqPlease win for the city jerseys @nyknicksMy beloved @nyknicks are playing against the LeDrama san @Lakers.

We need this win, badly. 

#NewYorkForever@nyknicks please let's win tonight in our building thanks@nyknicks Until you make McBride and Grimmes a part of the rotation you will continue to lose games due to bad defense. Both McBride &amp; Grimmes can play better defense than Kemba and Fornier. And they can score too. You drafted them for a reason, but what do I know🤷NEXT MONTH: American-Israeli basketball coach Amar'e Stoudemire will speak to our community over Zoom. 🏀 A six-time NBA All-Star, he has played for the Phoenix Suns, New York Knicks, Dallas Mavericks and Miami Heat. 

For more details, visit https://t.co/SFwNKUm3Ek. https://t.co/GUXDdv0QqOImagine being that poor soul that bought a @nyknicks ticket for tonight to see @KingJames and the @Lakers, only to now not be able to see LBJ because he's suspended. Ouch.@sny_knicks Best think you did was lose to the heat in 5 , the bucks made the playoffs with monta Ellis and Jeff Teague and you couldn’t get there with the Knicks , Knicks ruined there up and coming team to get you , you did nothing in New York , street cred champ nothin more@TylaDecker @nyknicks @KnicksNation @TheKnicksWall @KnicksMSGN @KnicksFanTv @KnicksCentral @TalkinKnicks @KnicksNetwork Wooooooooooo that’s fire 🔥👀 @Jason NY Knicks @nyknicks 
https://t.co/syvMi1c2ZyI demand Frank Vogel to start Carmelo in the starting lineup to replace LBJ since he’s suspended. And Melo will go off against his former team the New York Knicks.@AnthraxJones On the other hand no one in New York will notice it because everyone in New York is too busy caring about relevant teams like the Knicks and JetsCOLLEGE BASKETBALL:

 https://t.co/gozzyUWHhU@nba I'm done. Letting Lebron do what he did and punishing the victim is abhorrent. @nyknicks I won't be a fan any more because of the league. Goodbye.This is the first suspension in LeBron James' 19-year career, and will miss the game against the New York Knicks. Stewart will miss the home game against the Heat and will not play on the road against the Bucks. https://t.co/IRhD0VnttTHonestly surprised that the NBA suspended LeBron for his only game in New York against the Knicks in primetime. But at least they are fair since I would expect someone else to get suspended for that.The NBA announced the suspensions Monday, and both will affect games on Tuesday. LeBron James will not play when the Lakers visit Madison Square Garden to play the New York Knicks. https://t.co/6Lrdb0D5MzThe NBA announced the suspensions Monday, and both will affect games on Tuesday.

Bad news for the #Lakers and Good news for the #Knicks who play LA tomorrow night at MSG.

https://t.co/qQ2ysIIQxA via @Deepnightpress@HanaHoops @nyknicks Bust@JMGlitch1 Knicks young core is underrated but it was never the main reason why I’m high on their future. New York’s ability to attract ⭐️ talent is the #1 advantage. 

Having OG/Scottie and potentially adding Chet/Duren would give them the edge. Either way I don’t care.@notorioustei @nyknicks He will :/
