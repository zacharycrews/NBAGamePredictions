You don’t need Richaun Holmes u have Sabonis. Richaun will just clog the rotation and hold back your run for the play-in. I suggest you trade him for a veteran win now PG like Goran Dragic to help Fox. https://t.co/9rMdh45ozONBA Live Scores: Game open!

Why Kyrie Irving can only play away games.@BONEOHFIVE @JoshRWilliams4 @SacramentoKings @utahjazz I think Barnes would be a starter for the Jazz &amp; Clarkson is a bench player. Plus Utah has enough scoring at the guard spot w Donovan &amp; Conley &amp; could really use the length, defense, &amp; 3 point shooting Barnes can provide. If the Jazz could switch that, I think they should imo@iamprimalmusic @Witcuh1 Bagley was out of the rotation on the Sacramento Kings, Zubac has been starting on a contender since 2019.

Fromstrictly a basketball perspective, Sabin is a stud. #trusttheprocess???@SacramentoKings Yo Wtf Sabonis just ruined his career kings haven't made the playoffs since '06@SacramentoKings And anyone saying hali is better than fox, had to of bumped their head. Really? No way in hell. Fox was the franchise player before he came along for a reason. Plain and simple. Hali hasn’t even put up numbers like fox consistently. His 3 point average is high bec. less shots. 🤣@SacramentoKings How are the @SacramentoKings still an organization?Crying over the Kings of Sacramento? https://t.co/q9N6MeN8hZ@SacramentoKings Sorry to the fans but y’all got a good one with Sabonis too!

Buddy Hield went from the Sacramento Kings to the Indiana Pacers yesterday via the Domantas Sabonis trade and likely will be staying put. ESPN’s Zach Lowe reports that Hield seems unlikely to be moved by his new team before the deadline@SacramentoKings We all loved Haliburton... But we still got the better player in return.@SacramentoKings David Lee was a multi-time all star too. Who gives a shit@SacramentoKings @DaddyHubbyRobb I will not tolerate this Ralph Sampson erasure on my timeline.  This is at least the second time we've acquired a multi-time all star via trade.

Hopefully this time goes better for everyone involved. https://t.co/0b8o2MYuoV@SacramentoKings People are so butt hurt over this trade to see the real potential this team has now. Get over how liked Haliburton was, likeness doesn’t win games. Results do, and what was on the floor wasn’t working with 3 guards. A little overcrowded. Sucks, Haliburton had to go.

#Betting #FreePicks https://t.co/pUhLDtMtt6@SacramentoKings @swipathefox How are people still kings fans@camilacamfam Were not trading him bro, i can’t imagine us pulling a sacramento kings move😭🙏@AlexKennedyNBA Its all bullcrap. It the script was flipped and Kings traded Sabonis traded for Haliburton, same trash would be said against Sacramento. No one knows yet. Not even 1 game has been played with the new players. With Haliburton, Kings were not winning.@KWright2 @NBCSCeltics Take a Xanax, dude. Most of these blow it up idiots were advocating trading Jalen Brown for the Sacramento Kings lineup earlier.

Knowing when not to panic sell is as valuable as knowing when to sell, period. The worst moves GMs make is listening to panicked too online fans.@KingJames How you call yourself a King but don’t wanna play for the @SacramentoKings, I’m sure we can draft your son too, holla@SacramentoKings @Dsabonis11 As a wise man once said:

They're called the Kings
But ain't they got no rings
And at the end of the regular season, they always pack their things.How do Kings fans feel about the Haliburton-Sabonis deal?

Sabonis attempted more 3-pointers as a rookie in Oklahoma City (159) than he would over the next three seasons combined after being traded to Indiana. How might his game change in Sacramento?

But we need to make a few more changes!The Sacramento Kings have to be the worst franchise in all major sports.Okay @SacramentoKings, here's my offer - just one season and $1 million, I'll run the team, make some trades, help with the culture - let's face it, I can't do any worse than what's happened the last 16 years.  Deal?I grew up in Portland my entire life. My family used to go to church with Arvydas Sabonis lol So I grew up listening to him play on the Blazers. Now is son is a Sacramento King. He’s gonna be dominant. I’m starting to love this trade more and more honestly.The Sacramento Kings are "sending more frequent signals" that the team plans to keep Harrison Barnes rather than trade him prior to Thursday's trade deadline, per @TheSteinLine

Kings fans don't need to be preached at.  Thanks.I actually don't think the Kings made a bad move. They are two games out of the play-in and now have two all star caliber players around 25.

Fox or Sabonis? #sacramentoproud #NBATwitter@Matt_Barnes22 @SacramentoKings 100% agree. I think it could be a fantastic move.@Matt_Barnes22 @SacramentoKings I love Tyrese, but I think this was a good trade for the Kings. I’d like to see a lineup of Fox, Mitchell, Barnes, Sabonis, and Holmes start, but I’m betting they’re working on a Holmes trade. @ClutchPointsNBA is suggesting Holmes for Oubre.@SpencerKeele @SacramentoKings @utahjazz I had to check real quick if this was ballsack sports post. Jauncho is not guarding a traffic cone my guy. Hes only good for 3s if you can excuse his poor defense long enough hes ur guy@Matt_Barnes22 @SacramentoKings Just waiting to see the next move, I love Hali and didn’t want him nor Fox to go but kinda knew if they were going trade one of them it would be Hali, but these things happen and now the Kings just have to complete the transformation.@Matt_Barnes22 @SacramentoKings Anything to get rid of buddy sucks to see Hali go but atleast it wasn’t like boogie where we got nothing back@SacramentoKings @Dsabonis11 Does he not have a twitter account?@Matt_Barnes22 @SacramentoKings Spot on!@NBA2K @LD2K @Ronnie2K @tpgotgame @Beluba @CHoops4Life are definitely the @SacramentoKings if there's ever an NBA comparison@SacramentoKings @Dsabonis11 Welcome Sabonis we will love you here@ScarfaceCA @SacramentoKings @TyHaliburton22 We got Sabonis..@jmamahama @SacramentoKings @TyHaliburton22 We got Sabonis dude lol@javarichs @SacramentoKings @TyHaliburton22 @mmcnair What tf do Vlade's bad draft picks have to do with this trade???The Sacramento Kings are chasing a play-in spot and the team plans to keep Harrison Barnes rather than trade him, per @TheSteinLine https://t.co/nmgFKwiNKK@SpencerKeele @SacramentoKings @utahjazz Clarkson's streaky play is better than Barnes disappearing act.@Matt_Barnes22 @SacramentoKings I think McNair has got absolutely zero idea.&lt; 24 hours to go until the NBA trade deadline: Sacramento has been sending more frequent signals that it plans to keep Harrison Barnes rather than trade him, league sources say, as it chases a playoff play-in spot.

The Kings have missed the playoffs for 15 seasons in a row.@Matt_Barnes22 @SacramentoKings Sad to see a fan favorite go.
Hali was very vocal about his love for Sac and bringing us back to respectability.

Emotions aside, SabonIs is hell of a player,
It’ll be interesting to see how he meshes with Fox.

Few years down the line, Monte will either look like a genius or notive had my fair lamentations about the knicks. but boy am i fucking glad im not a sacramento kings fan. sabonis is cool. but im convinced they dont watch their own team play?!? tyrese is the guy u chose rlly???@SammyGifford @SacramentoKings @TyHaliburton22 @buddyhield Dude that one stung@Matt_Barnes22 @SacramentoKings I’m heartbroken 💔…I thought we could build something special around Fox and Haliburton, but the key word is BUILD!!

Thompson &amp; Hield could be traded again today, but only by themselves, not in a deal that required their salary to be added to someone else's to work.@r1burgos @TyHaliburton22 @SacramentoKings That shit still doesnt make no sense cant believe they traded him broPlease stop referring to the Sacramento Kings as a "Poverty Franchise".

That is too mean.

It is more appropriate to call the Sacramento Kings an "Underserved Community",

BUT, there’s a chance they could include the Kings in the original Jazz/Blazers/Spurs trade and make it work that way. 

CC @k_clayt@StocktonKings @SacramentoKings @thebobbyjackson shut up #plandemic@iwasmmueller88 @utahjazzman47 @SacramentoKings @utahjazz I thought it was you cant be traded to a team aggregated with other players from the old team which should matter because the Jazz didn't get anyone else from the Spurs?

Ouch! 😂😅@SacramentoKings @TyHaliburton22 This whole franchise is on some hard ass drugs@joshdm23x @SacramentoKings @TyHaliburton22 Sabonis can leave without compensation in 2024.

This will change the Kings offense for the better.

Don't get me wrong, Domantas Sabonis is a great player and all. But Haliburton was a perfect fit in Sacramento next to Fox. At least Thompson was moved? Hope Davion Mitchell doesn't have the same fate.@HxnchoZac @Shimonbentabo @SacramentoKings @ankr Sabonis is a solid big man no doubt. But in the kings situation and lineup, this isn’t a win now move. Paint is gonna be clogged with no shooters on the outside. And be real, Haliburton has better numbers than that and he handles the ball better than fox.

Make it make sense.@HoeyRobert @Chembalnc @SacramentoKings @TyHaliburton22 F**k that! Hali was our guy!@Notorious_JGB @SacramentoKings @TyHaliburton22 I’m not trying to be a dick man.

Like vlade not getting luka. This GM will be remember when monte let go haliburton. If it doesnt work in 2 years I think we need a new GM@JayMarZZ It’s not that he just loved Sacramento, Sacramento loved him back. Hali was a great asset and probably the most promising player we had on our team. Business is business, but Hali meant a lot to Kings fans.@Matt_Barnes22 @SacramentoKings It hurt. Halliburton was my favorite player and we stole him in the draft. I wanted to trade Fox honestly but…I am ready to move forward.@RobLobster43 @SacramentoKings @RedFastReview Kings fan base https://t.co/CACcuxU6AA@Matt_Barnes22 @SacramentoKings Sabonis will definitely help our offense that often gets mired into ISO ball, and he sets great screens.Hali will be an all-star sooner in the east I think. I think it will make a huge difference for Fox. I always sad to see a good player go but We got one in return.The poor man is a Sacramento King..... just leave him alone he don't need anymore pain 😪 https://t.co/p2dFvifLdW@hawks fire whoever is in charge of scouting, drafting, and trading.

Just when you think they’ll keep a good player and build a team around them, they get traded@Matt_Barnes22 @SacramentoKings Dumb trade by dumb out-of-touch ownership who keeps shipping away blue chips for party rentals. Trading loyal players who want to turn the franchise around for guys literally counting the days until they can leave. The biggest loser is Kings fans AGAIN. @SacramentoKings, I apologize to @TyHaliburton22, and Kings fans. I didn't realize the love you, and the fans had for each other.  I listened to @Matt_Barnes22. @DeuceMason @momoragan.

His passing ability is off the charts!

There are still a few moves to be made and hopefully they help us out long-term!

https://t.co/lQ4WqwEV7iAs a Sacramento native and lifelong @SacramentoKings fan, I can only say this is another notch in a long trend of WTF trades by the Kings.

I just need to see Sabonis and Fox play well together, and I'll start feeling better.@Matt_Barnes22 @SacramentoKings We needed to change the make up of this team. Hali might be an Allstar down the line but we said the samething about Fox few yrs ago. Sabonis is an All star now with big upside and still young. If we can get Collins with 1-8 protected, Marvin or Harris, we good 👍@SacramentoKings @TyHaliburton22 YALL FUCKED UUUPPPP@SacramentoKings @Dsabonis11 @JustHolla7 @jlamb Went to my first Kings game at the original Arco in 1986 when I was 8.  Lived through a lot of horrible years but still loved the team.

Until now.

Traded the one guy who actually wants to play in Sac and make the team successful for a 2 year rental of Sabonis.

I'm doneTough loss last night @SacramentoKings . They should trade for a young talent like @TyHaliburton22 . A guy that we could build our franchise around for the next 10-15 years to play along Fox. Man if only we could’ve drafted that dude. #WhatCouldveBeen@SiriusXMNBA @Scalabrine @SacramentoKings Hope kings make play in just to scare the lakers@SacramentoKings @Dsabonis11 @JustHolla7 @jlamb New era is upon us 💪🏽💜💪🏽💜The Kings made one of the first major moves before the deadline trading for 2x NBA All-Star Domantas Sabonis. 

@Scalabrine thinks this move will give the @SacramentoKings the momentum they need. https://t.co/Xhpiew6v0E@TyHaliburton22 Tyrese,
You are a phenomenal player and I wish you the best of luck on the Pacers. Although I wish that you were still playing for my Kings, I'd rather you go to a team with potential as opposed to staying in Sacramento and having your career wasted.@Matt_Barnes22 @SacramentoKings I agree Matt@TyHaliburton22 Tyrese thanks for your contributions to the Kings and the Sacramento community. Good luck with your new team. You will be missed.@jkirkthelurk @CarmichaelDave Yeah, I am with you. The Bulls had a real plan, the @SacramentoKings are just hoping that a wild swing lands. Yeah, you gotta give up good to get good players, but this is just shuffling the deck for a new look.I live in Sacramento. I miss living in NYC, but for my purposes as a 33 year old lawyer with a fiancée, it suits me fine. 

If I were 21 and a millionaire athlete, this place would SUCK. A guy like Hali, who is those things and somehow likes it here, was a godsend for the Kings.“We use the term “warrior” a lot on the broadcast… to me, he’s the second-best passing big man in the NBA."

@PacersJJ joined The @CarmichaelDave Show with @JasonRoss1140 this morning to discuss what Domantas Sabonis can bring to the Sacramento Kings 👑
https://t.co/1N3kt5d0MI@Matt_Barnes22 @SacramentoKings Still in awe but moving forward from it. Seeing where we go now.@SacramentoKings @TyHaliburton22 I'm glad you are closer to home, cant wait to see you in more games.@SacramentoKings Lmao sabonis is good but not great . I would never have gave up tyrese in that trade . I’m not a kings or pacers fan either . So I’m not being bias .You know what @swipathefox @KDTrey5 and @KyrieIrving could do together? 

BLOW IT UP @SacramentoKings
 
PLEASE!@Matt_Barnes22 @SacramentoKings Morning after and a more resolute…WTF Monte? Halliburton? Who’s going pass the ball?It's tough 2 b a @SacramentoKings fan &amp; I don't agree w/ this trade. 2 straight yrs w/ a good draft &amp; we trade a stud like  @TyHaliburton22 away. I don't get it. Does management want #Kings fans to be extinct? #AskingForAFriend &amp; me. Good Luck Ty. #GetIt on March 23rd@Matt_Barnes22 @SacramentoKings I agree with you more moves need to be made but I’m a fan of the potential pick and roll game of fox and sabonis, had to give up something great to get potential and I feel this deal did just that! Hinders on faith, fox has to be better on defense for this to workLmaooooooooooooooo Sacramento Kings here you come. https://t.co/FsI7jfjZNLSacramento Kings Got Taking Advantage Of With That Trade@Matt_Barnes22 @Spiicy_P @SacramentoKings We probably have to move Holmes unfortunately.  Rese and Holmes were probably the 2 most likeable guys on this team.  I don't think Fox can operate with 2 bigs that don't stretch the floor.  And we're def on the clock now.  We need to compete these next 2 yrs or Sabonis walks@JustinS3LF @SacramentoKings There’s like 5 of us that believe kings got the winning trade.@ricebreh @kirkgoldsberry @espn @wojespn @SacramentoKings @Pacers @TyHaliburton22 don’t forget about Myles Turner, our high lottery pick and other 1st rounder from cavs, Kings just got Son’d by Pacers….and that’s ok 👌🏼 😊the sacramento kings fucking stink man haliburton was the future@Matt_Barnes22 @SacramentoKings I would’ve preferred a Fox for BI swap but the Pels went a different way. On paper this is how you build a successful franchise, but it’s still on paper and this is still Sacramento. Gotta get back something good for Bagley still.“The Kings were under the impression that they could acquire Randle for the right return. Now that Sacramento has acquired Domantas Sabonis, it seems logical to count them out as a Randle suitor.”

Knicks FO is playing scared https://t.co/PKlB4H5UUJthe sacramento kings are officially on my hate listHorford, Nesmith, and a 1st rounder for Harrison Barnes and Justin Holiday. @celtics @SacramentoKings@Matt_Barnes22 @SacramentoKings It doesn’t surprise me. But it does disappoint me. With the 3 guards we had (Fox, Hali, Mitchell) Fox was the least productive on a nightly basis. I get Hali is our best asset to make a trade. But to get a big in a league that’s more position-less than ever, makes no sense.#NBA

Timberwolves are 3-1-1 ATS in the last 5 meetings in Sacramento
Timberwolves are 14-5 ATS in their last 19 games vs. a team with a losing record
Timberwolves are 2-7 ATS in their last 9 road games
Kings are 4-1 ATS in their last 5 games as a home underdog@Matt_Barnes22 @Spiicy_P @SacramentoKings Why do you think Fox has been so poor on the defensive end this season?@Matt_Barnes22 @SacramentoKings Hali is Lonzo lite (Zo is bigger and longer). If he fixes his shit he’ll be a star but that’s asking a lot. At least when Zo’e shot was broke he could still shoot off the dribble going left. Hali cant either way - he needs to side step to get it off

Sabonis not even in prime yet@SacramentoKings @swipathefox @ridespin Spin of the game presented by 'The fans brains after hearing about the Haliburton trade'I still can't believe the Sacramento Kings are so damn dumb. Tyrese and Buddy for Sabonis? Really? It's not a knock on Sabonis at all. He's an all star caliber player. He's proven that. But he's 26. He's reached his potential. And it's not a championship team's best player.If the Sacramento Kings get Julius Randle I will go to the games https://t.co/Y36d3as0mj@SacramentoKings Is Sabonis available tonight?@GrantNapearshow Sacramento Kings related Twitter community is so unhinged, that no one outside of SAC understand what they want except to be mad every day. Who wants to play in SAC with such a toxic atmosphere 24/7? If this hysteria goes on,Fox and Sabonis will leave SAC eventually.@SacramentoKings it's about time you got rid of Buddy hield Tyrese he will be an All-Star soon believe that
 sabonis he okay we'll see and Tristan Kardashian thank God you got rid of him@SacramentoKings You stupid Stupid shit https://t.co/kZFrt9uq0VDid @sacramentokings fans get want they wanted? “Shake it up,” you saidBoy went on National TV and poured his heart out talking about wanting to change the culture in Sacramento kings organization. They told him he wouldn’t be traded. He was in their long term plans.

Traded his ass 2 weeks later… smh. #ForThePlayers@Matt_Barnes22 @SacramentoKings I am both excited and devistated. Sabonis is a big prize. Halliburton is just so easy to love.The Kings were among the teams interested in Julius Randle, per @IanBegley 

“The Kings were under the impression that they could acquire Randle for the right return. Now that Sacramento has acquired Domantas Sabonis, it seems logical to count them out as a Randle suitor.” https://t.co/SDPre0gb3XIf you’re the Kings, the most valuable asset in the world should be a cheap, young, highly productive player who against all odds likes being in Sacramento and wants to stay there long term. And they just ditched that guy for a player who can and likely will walk in two years. https://t.co/QHrLe6IbHdIf the Kings can grab Collins for a package that includes Barnes and a future protected first you have to pull the trigger. The core of Sacramento would be:

Fox- 24 years old
Sabonis- 25 years old
Collins- 24 years old

The direction of the kings would be clear. Which is new. https://t.co/4DF35ty0dISacramento Kings did Tyrese Haliburton dirty…he played his heart out for that terrible franchise. Then they lie and tell him they’re not trading him. He was the best thing to happen to that team in more than a decade. Such a good dude too. #NBA #Kings #NBATradeDeadline@RussoRaps The Detroit lions and the Sacramento kings would like to have a word with youday 2 of asking the @SacramentoKings for a free @Dsabonis11 jerseyDaniel Snyder is essentially Donald Stern if Donald Stern owned the Sacramento Kings.

So sad. https://t.co/1uAA3lMNge@Matt_Barnes22 @damienbarling @SacramentoKings Need more shooting and defense around Sabonis.  

Fox and a unprotected 2025 first for Simmons 

Holmes for PJ Washington and Kai Jones.  

-Bagley and a 2024 pick swap and PJ for Jerami Grant 

-Barnes and Kai and a unprotected 2023 first for John Collins?Two-time all-star center Domantas Sabonis is now a Sacramento King following a blockbuster six-player trade with the Indiana Pacers. https://t.co/HhxMj1j8mc@SacramentoKings Cool-dudes that we traded@ricebreh @Matt_Barnes22 @SacramentoKings 🤣 NOLA laughs you off the phone@forpive @SacramentoKings @swipathefox @ridespin so get tf outta hr, we want to support L franchis because we live here in Sacramento.

O Sacramento Kings troca Tyreese Halibourton, Buddy Hield e Tristan Thompson por Domanta Sabonis, Justin Holiday e Jeremy Lamb (+ 2 picks). https://t.co/ZBRkY1TPMP@SacramentoKings @Dsabonis11 Welcome to Sac Sabonis!! cant wait to see you beast it in the paint !!!man cry those tears of joy you’re leaving the sacramento kings https://t.co/O2pHamc3j7The newest Kings players officially arrived in Sacramento last night https://t.co/6FFCXcrrrd@AaronQuinn716 Sacramento Kings been making their case since like 2007.@Matt_Barnes22 @ReprezentX @SacramentoKings Agreed. Round of applause to monte. It’s not easy making a trade of that magnitude when you have heart strings attached. Idk who’d trade a guy like haliburton so soon, but you must have some huge cajones to do that knowing what he means to the fan base and city. Respect@SacramentoKings @TyHaliburton22 Is Sac Kings social throwing shade at Sac Kings management with this tweet?   I think so!@_yoshow @SacramentoKings Ahaha true true. But officially join us bro. Right on time too with the opening of our new stadium soonOk, let's try this again... 

Which team currently owns the title of "Worst Franchise in All of Sports" over the last decade. Not about what MAY happen in the future. 

I feel like it is a battle between the Sacramento Kings and Buffalo Sabres. 

Thoughts?@Matt_Barnes22 @SacramentoKings I Definitely agree with that. I think Sabonis stretches the floor better than most centers. He can shoot the 3. I agree I think this is a better team with D jones on the floor together.IF Metu could shoot a lil higher percentage from 3 they could be a really good duo to have.The Sacramento Kings really picked Marvin Bagely over LukaHarden is pushing for this trade, according to Windhorst.

"I can't tell you how much James Harden wants this," said Windhorst.

Windhorst suggests the way Harden played at the Sacramento Kings was a signal he wants out. Harden has subsequently not played at all for the Nets. https://t.co/6ZQl6wCyY0 https://t.co/z1klRJzGQO@Matt_Barnes22 @SacramentoKings This move has big potential, as we kept all our picks too. Hali will always hurt, because you can’t not-love him. Domantas is just a year and a half older than Fox and can set very solid screens -&gt; 🔥🔥🔥 combo!
If the Pacers trade Buddy too, it was just a Hali for Sabonis swap.@Matt_Barnes22 @SacramentoKings We honestly didn’t need a trade like this maybe just a small trade like another wing and getting a bigger center, trade holmes and bagley for jaxson hayes and herb jones@Matt_Barnes22 @SacramentoKings Feelings aside. Smart/great move!!"Windhorst suggests the way Harden played at the Sacramento Kings was a signal he wants out. Harden has subsequently not played at all for the Nets."

I get that Harden's talented, but, assuming this is true, why would anyone build around a star that's this petty? https://t.co/K5j5j6VlLxI'm all for trying to take the steps that matter to a franchise like the Kings. But when that comes at the expense of Sacramento's best draft pick of at least the last decade, what will that instant gratification (if any) be worth in a few years?
https://t.co/t0GCqx3SrAThe @SacramentoKings will trade Jeremy Lamb and Justin Holiday for Buddy and Tyrese https://t.co/oWVRFSe6Du@TakeThatCDC @DasStoopid @Unwise_Trousers @imalillygirl33 @Progressive_RN @kgopinion @72MichiganPapa @JustaCoinToss @_AbolishPolice_ @Balancement @laflemm12 @ahf77118198 @SandraHelena39 @dovesandletters @TZidanista @Zenfucius @SacramentoKings @goonerdave66 @ChristineEliaz @montecoman @gabriel67891734 @larkin_robertl @HopeInTheUSA @Roan_onHorton @DarkEntree @a9ymous @The_Acumen @blackintheempir @donotwriteback1 @SJonesWasTaken @glowingcanary @katalin_pota @debpresente @KCdirector @MariaSvetlakov @MikhailUC @hairygit @LucyTreadwell01 @VivetVeritate @HedwigOwlett @EmmaDubya @undrcvrbrothr @anthonyzenkus @DenyThemEssence @TimOnTheTractor @mrs_socialista @DoctorFishbones @Jaybefaunt @WendyOrent @TinFoilAwards We must protect the children@SacramentoKings @TyHaliburton22 Ty gona be a stud in Indy I’d be sick right now @SacramentoKings fans.Tyrese Haliburton played only 109 games for Sacramento, but I think he’ll be beloved by Kings fans forever. An all-time favorite with lots of incredible plays packed into a short timeframe, like J-Will.

Best of luck in Indy, @TyHaliburton22! https://t.co/1CTjDtWgpu@Matt_Barnes22 @SacramentoKings DefinitelyThe Sacramento Kings are the modern day comparison version of: 

Mike Milbury era Islanders

Jaguars

#DUUUVAL #IslesThis might go down as one of the worst things the Kings ever have done, and that's saying a lot. Sacramento nails the pick, the kid made a public commitment to improving the franchise and changing the culture for the better, and they shipped him out. I just don't get it https://t.co/hJKFJOnH8t@Matt_Barnes22 @SacramentoKings Not a fan of the move but let’s see what they do to close out the deadline. As of now we have 0 spacing and the defense might be even worse depending on who is starting#NBA75 tonight:
Timberwolves @ Sacramento Kings
Over 235 @ 1.93@nyknicks @SacramentoKings @ATLHawks goran dragic is going to the highest bidder, send offers before 1pm thank you very much@Matt_Barnes22 @SacramentoKings If the blue print behind this move is mirroring Chicago Bulls, we need to find our lonzo and demar quick, unless Harrison is the demar kings are seeing and davion is the lonzo ball kings envision.@SacramentoKings @TyHaliburton22 fuckkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk@kongvang88 @SacramentoKings @TyHaliburton22 I think if monte had the balls to pull the trigger on this type of move, he has to have more shit cookin@Matt_Barnes22 @MATTinthe916 @SacramentoKings The kings will need to use their draft capital and remaining pieces to get a 3rd star for this group.@Matt_Barnes22 @SacramentoKings Very true. Thats why we have to wait and see how this plays out on the court. Yes, its hard to see a player like Haliburton go but something had to change. Haliburton has the most value to get value back.@Matt_Barnes22 @SacramentoKings At 1st I was like WTF!!!! But then realized we are not winning. It took unpopular moves during the glory days so my hope this is a start in the right direction. Can’t get any worse than it already is IMO. Have a great day.@tetonogard @SacramentoKings Agreed@drunkspecialist @SacramentoKings Yes they needed it but davion Mitchell,fox and Clarkson

C'mmon that's not happening.

And Barnes for Clarkson is not fair.@Matt_Barnes22 @Spiicy_P @SacramentoKings That's what makes this trade difficult, Ty checked the first two and willingness to improve on the last.@Robdw18W @SacramentoKings It’s move of an emotional attachment rather than a bad basketball move IMOSources have informed me that Sacramento Kings C Richaun Holmes will be heading to the Raptors as part of a package deal. #NBATradeDeadline #RaptorsOk im convinced the @SacramentoKings are purposely trying to stay bad@WernerMartens82 @KeralaBlasters @kbfc_manjappada For those who don't know Phil Jackson, he's one of the best basketball coaches in the nba history, he coached the Sacramento kings ( greatest show on court ), a team now owned by an Indian American philanthropist.@Matt_Barnes22 @damienbarling @SacramentoKings Us Luka and now Hali. For the kings sake I hope this dude reaches the heights the team is expecting from him. I’m no longer a believer (Good player) I just would of went with Hali. Time will tell if this was the right move or not.@sac92310 Sacramento fans should be extremely appreciative to the ownership group for saving the team. But fans are passed the honeymoon stage. They want results. Vivek is a great guy and he’s done a lot for the community. But the Kings have yet to make the playoffs in his time as ownerBro, who honestly wakes up a Sacramento Kings fan?@TanLStevenson @XXLrgPopcorn @SacramentoKings It’s a cold business. I just feel you can always be honest within that@Matt_Barnes22 @SacramentoKings We might be in good hands with Monte atleast now we know he's not afraid to piss off a already angry fan base lol to get shit done this trade might be what we needed. But damn WE LOVED HALI@Matt_Barnes22 @damienbarling @SacramentoKings It’s a good haul from a value perspective but it really highlights the direction this team is trying to take, and frankly it’s short sighted. Mortgaging their future to maybe hopefully have a first round exit. The Kings will regret this trade for a long long time.The @SacramentoKings trade didn’t phase me. I wasn’t excited or upset, just blah. I joked with a friend that the Kings finally broke me. But, I turned on @CarmichaelDave this morning for the first time in a while….@Matt_Barnes22 @damienbarling @SacramentoKings I hate it Matt! It’s been 5 years waiting to see #5 reach his potential and be the “star@ I thought he was capable of becoming. Dude is too inconsistent and a one trick pony. We gave up a young guard who in my opinion is a true building block for the future. Waiting on #5 cost..@Matt_Barnes22 @SacramentoKings Only other players of Sabonis caliber we could’ve prob gotten for Fox was either Simmons or Randle. I might’ve been happier today if we traded Fox for Randle and build around Hali and Randle instead. Idk tho man this shit still hurts.@Matt_Barnes22 @damienbarling @SacramentoKings Woke up with the same pit in my stomach that I had once hearing the news. Time will tell if this works out. No doubt that sabonis is the better player right now, but I get this feeling, that we did this move to end the playoff drought rather than build a contender.@XXLrgPopcorn @SacramentoKings Same shit w boogie lied to him the entire time &amp; traded him while he’s on the podium at all star smh. Remember they traded boogie cause they said buddy was the nxt Steph 🤔🏀 The NBA trade deadline is heating up! @KingChuddy  tells us who really won the @Pacers / @SacramentoKings trade that swapped @TyHaliburton22 and Sabonis in another major blockie 👇

#NBA @NBA #NBATradeDeadline #tradedeadline @buddyhield
https://t.co/ldmod1VyHZ@Matt_Barnes22 @SacramentoKings We have a clear direction of win now. Sabonis is a good compliment for Fox. Trade came 20 games too late tho. IMO Fox needs the play-in experience.Still salty AF right now and in my feelings. Livid with @SacramentoKings organization. Time will tell if a FUQ with them the rest of the season. https://t.co/GVGZwYDDSPA lot of moving parts in the @Pacers @SacramentoKings  trade involving @TyHaliburton22 @buddyhield and Sabonis. Here's the salary info for the main parts. Lamb 10M this year. Holiday 6M this year and next. https://t.co/6l9KcWyJ1D@Matt_Barnes22 @SacramentoKings Idk man, huge fan of ATS btw! I did want to keep hali, that being said Fox is a monster himself and I’m fully confident in his abilities to lead this team! Fox, hali, and Mitchell I felt like one had to go but we would be good with whoever was gonna stay@itzMJT @SacramentoKings I think that’s the common theme@MATTinthe916 @SacramentoKings Unfortunately sac will never be a free agent destination. That’s why it’s important for management to think outside the box. Have to win in the draft which they’ve done the last two drafts &amp; have to capitalize in trades. Free agency they will have to overpay roll players@SacramentoKings @TyHaliburton22 He's about to be multiple times all star, MVPs, and potentially several playoff runs with the Pacers@C_Air23 @SacramentoKings I still want Bibby@Matt_Barnes22 @SacramentoKings The emotional connection I had with Tyrese and his potential was strong.  Made this trade hard to get excited about. Need to see Sabonis play in a Kings uniform to calm myself down.The @sacramentokings are a shit show and have been since the late 90’s. https://t.co/40kYgbhMeT@BenAxelrod Nonzero chance the Sacramento Kings will be scouting this game.@SacramentoKings how are you guys going to embarrass us today?The Sacramento Kings are the most dead franchise in professional sports https://t.co/kLnogJ898z@SantiagoAuFund Well, my Sacramento Kings just shorted the only good player they had left (Halliburton). So I can’t really hate too much on your short of silver. It’s all relative 😂Is it a good trade for the @SacramentoKings? Is Sabonis any good? This @Lakers fan would love to see a viable rivalry again.I love how national media became all of a sudden Kings experts after yesterday. I mean I've never seen/hear them stop talking about the Lakers, or the Nets, or the Warriors. But hey they all know what’s best for the Kings. @SacramentoKings @ESPNNBA @Sports1140KHTK  @NBATV@EriUriQ @SacramentoKings @JustHolla7 Yea he will still play@Matt_Barnes22 @SacramentoKings Trade is a ok for SAC, Fox is not included because of max contract salary, Hali has rookie salary and Buddy with his salary match Sabonis salary. Main issue now is lack od PG/SG options in this roster. Fox, Devion and Lamb. One injured PG/SG and this will be huge problem@shadrack40 @Matt_Barnes22 @damienbarling @SacramentoKings Is Barnes next?@SacramentoKings y’all hiring in the front office I think us Twitter casuals can help you out??@Matt_Barnes22 @SacramentoKings Hali was nice but far from a Ja Morant, Sabonis is an actual all star now! Two maybe three more deals without dealing 1st rounders unless a Simmons, Jaylen brown available.The @SacramentoKings are a dumpster fire and I am glad Haliburton got out of there. Indiana definitely won the trade.@SacramentoKings y’all don’t deserve a nba team https://t.co/UPudbhaO5LWestbrook is going to be a Sacramento King.@Matt_Barnes22 @SacramentoKings Glad Fox is still on the roster but felt like Hali should have been a piece to build around also. Wish him the best of luck. Seems like an amazing kid and super high character guy off the court as well. Indy got a real one!@Matt_Barnes22 @SacramentoKings I am going to miss Hali for sure, however, the team's progress cannot be held up by a fan favorite. Hali had great potential and will go on and showcase his talents and I will continue to support him.

I won't fully judge this move until they all have some games under their belt.@Matt_Barnes22 @SacramentoKings Feeling good to see Buddy gone@SacramentoKings @Dsabonis11 3 team trade deal to keep Sabonis and get Hali back?Honestly at this point just make me the Sacramento Kings GM@SacramentoKings @TyHaliburton22 you will always be a King bro @TyHaliburton22 thanks for everything 💜@Matt_Barnes22 @SacramentoKings Can't keep trying to build thru the draft forever. It hasn't work. We ripped Monte for standing pat for so long. But he has swung for the fences. I have to commend him for taking a swing.@SacramentoKings Part 2 tn https://t.co/c9bXlHYnsj@SacramentoKings RatioIf a @SacramentoKings fan wants to buy a jersey of their favorite player they are better off lighting their money on fire.@Matt_Barnes22 @SacramentoKings Agree 100%. No shade at bagley but do you think Sabonis is what we thought bagley was going to develop into?@Matt_Barnes22 @SacramentoKings Shit is trash!@SacramentoKings cancel the domas trade@Matt_Barnes22 @SacramentoKings When the news first broke I was shell shocked but now the dust settled I think I sort of like the move depending on what other moves the Kings make to compliment this one!@Matt_Barnes22 @damienbarling @SacramentoKings Love getting talent of Sabonis. Sad it had to be Hali. 🤞 it works..@ReprezentX @SacramentoKings Agreed. This is a very unpopular move but I commend Monte, something has to be done. Kings fans have suffered for too long. I hope it all works out@Matt_Barnes22 @damienbarling @SacramentoKings Just feeling hopeful, Matt. Just hoping this turns around back to a consistent product.@Matt_Barnes22 @SacramentoKings I feel a good solid tank would make the move sting less. Honestly I’m happy Tyrese has a squad in Indy and is closer to his mom and pops. Mans had 17 assists and said he didn’t play well 🤯 built different. Forever a fan@_erocc10_ @SacramentoKings I feel your pain… Lebron did it to the Lakers. Turned them ass backwardsThe @CredderApp team was thrilled last year when we won the @NBA @SacramentoKings Capitalize 2021 Contest. This year's competition is about to get underway and I had a chance to share some of the major ways winning propelled our business forward here: https://t.co/QOb7nuY8Vn@KingsGeneral01 @CarlosAntunes @SacramentoKings @swipathefox @hbarnes @dameology I dont know if having him benched all the time is good for his development as a player. At least let him play for Stockton so he can improve in a competitive environment. Last night was really bad.Los Indiana Pacers han decidido mandar a Domantas Sabonis, Jeremy Lamb y Justin Holiday a los Sacramento Kings por Tyrese Haliburton, Buddy Hield y Tristan Thompson

Zero loyalty in this game from organizations. That’s why player’s ALWAYS have to do what’s best for themselves@fbl_sam 'Report: The New York Knicks and Sacramento Kings have agreed on a deal to send Harrison Barnes to New York for Kemba Walker, Alec Burks and a protected future first round pick'@TyHaliburton22 As a @SacramentoKings fan I am very sorry to see you traded to @Pacers.  However I also sent my son to Indy for college from Sacramento.  I’m sure you will be great there.  If need any Indy tips hit up @DuncanStone2@SacramentoKings @James_HamNBA @JandersonSacBee @TimMaxwell22 @sactowncrown translate this to idiot Monty McNair https://t.co/ZchY6TyaKw@Matt_Barnes22 @damienbarling @SacramentoKings The goal is to win a championship not make a play-in or playoff. Does giving up 7-8 years of team control on Haliburton for 2 years of Sabonis make that happen? Unsure but the subsequent moves in the next two days have to be home runsThe good faith I had in the Sacramento Kings.
 #SacramentoProud https://t.co/y8FPdOcpky@Matt_Barnes22 @SacramentoKings Sac finally got an elite center something that they haven't had in awhile. Fox and Hali wasn't gonna work no matter what. Holmes can finally play the 4 because he gets eaten up by true centers. Kings got better. Pacers got better too.@KANGZLIFE @SacramentoKings Agreed@Matt_Barnes22 @SacramentoKings Just sucks that @TyHaliburton22 gotta be traded so soon, 2nd year only and we’ll be missing out on his potential; sabonis great addition; but other than that @SacramentoKings cannot be done making moves cause the trade puts the team nowhere really so waiting to hear what is nextWe LOVE Tyrese Halliburton.  I want my team to win.  But I wanted Reses Pieces to be a main ingredient in that delicious meal.  So fun to watch.  Such a seemingly awesome and good dude.  Kings lost a Prince today.  Shout to Buddy &amp; Tristian 
#SacramentoProud
@SacramentoKingsThe kings fucked up so bad they just traded the only player in NBA history who was sad to be traded from Sacramento…fold the franchise https://t.co/l5Btid9kJn@Matt_Barnes22 @SacramentoKings I think it's going to be tough for most people to honestly process until they see the new guys get a few games in. Until then, it's going to be really hard to separate the emotion.GAME DAY for the #Timberwolves!! 
🆚 Sacramento Kings (B2B)
⏰ 9:00PM CST
📍 Golden 1 Center https://t.co/rW2crWWtsb@Matt_Barnes22 @SacramentoKings Love the move. Got a player that is the best player on the team at only 25 years old. Love Hali, wish him the best. IMO, Kings fans are sad the personality is leaving more than the on court play.@007deeezyy @SacramentoKings I wouldn’t say nobody wanted Fox. Indy just didn’t want him. If the League would have known Hali was available It would have been Interested to see what kind of deals would have been on the table@dwilliams3bc @SacramentoKings How is Haliburton the cone stone when he was not in Sac 2 yrs. He is a fan favorite man cool guys good player. The only franchise guy is Fox. They been losing for 16 yrs they can't keep burning daylight on any fan favorite player. The city screaming for WINS.@Matt_Barnes22 @SacramentoKings This has been a thing 
Matt. People sleep his passing like you said. Vlade and C-Webb level of passing right now. Start Sabonis and Jones.
https://t.co/LfoKJpl862@Matt_Barnes22 @SacramentoKings We all loved Hali, we also are in love with his potential. Sabonis is an All Star level player now. This team needed talent and unfortunately, Hali was their best asset without giving up 1st rounders. From a BBall view, Im not mad at the move.@Matt_Barnes22 @SacramentoKings We need more shooting@Matt_Barnes22 @SacramentoKings It should have been Fox not Hali but the Kings have to move that dumdum Buddy Heild. Now the Pacers are trying to trade him.@kevlis0613 @SacramentoKings Hot take@Matt_Barnes22 @SacramentoKings We need a shooter that can play D.@Matt_Barnes22 @XXLrgPopcorn @SacramentoKings 100% this. Just like with the kyle guy stuff last summer, I see a pattern of ignoring the human side of the business@Spiicy_P @SacramentoKings I feel a move or two has to be made to make this trade really work. Also Fox is the key to all of this. His Leadership, Playmaking &amp; Defense all have to step up. A lot is asked when you’re the franchises guy. I feel he’s fully capable of doing it tho.@drunkspecialist @SacramentoKings We will even throw in the 6moy runner up!@Matt_Barnes22 @SacramentoKings I agree completely. I swore off the Kings (for a while, home is home) after how they treated Boogie. This isn't the same, but its not too different either.@Matt_Barnes22 @SacramentoKings Move had to be made .. just hated it hs to be Hali..@Matt_Barnes22 @SacramentoKings Not mad at it. Something significant had to change. Have to give up something to get something. Sacramento is not a destination for free agents at this time. Can’t always be lottery bound over and over.@PedroP95 @CarlosAntunes @SacramentoKings @swipathefox @hbarnes @dameology I think Nemi will take Richaun's place in the future. I think the Kings are trying to hide him because they don't want him to be traded.@Matt_Barnes22 @SacramentoKings Oh for sure, it stings to lose a great guy. (And I’ll follow him on league pass💜) But what we had was not adding up to wins.@Matt_Barnes22 @SacramentoKings Wasn't a big fan of the trade. Haliburton game is real nice. Hopefully the trade works out and they make a couple more moves.@XXLrgPopcorn @SacramentoKings It’s the business of the game unfortunately. I just don’t like how management lied to him the entire time telling him he wasn’t going nowhere. 
I’m sure trading players is tough but do it w integrity &amp; honesty.. People can’t respect you when you do it any other way@SacramentoKings @TyHaliburton22 Completely lost faith in this franchise 🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️@Matt_Barnes22 @SacramentoKings We needed to do something. We were not going anywhere. It hurts for sure but Sabonis is a monster. I just hope we get one more piece. Monte has guts making a move like this so I give him some credit@Matt_Barnes22 @damienbarling @SacramentoKings Wait and see.  I would hope after roster is finalized, we will make a playoff push.

But next year, this better be a 41 win team imo.  Otherwise, what are we doing?You guys definitely need a 6moy caliber player like Jordan clarkson to compete for the playoffs @SacramentoKings 👍🏾 https://t.co/69SAPQLnzPThe Sacramento Kings are going to regret trading away Tyrese Haliburton@Matt_Barnes22 @SacramentoKings Agreed when he signed that contract extension I knew then he was going for the bag.. and I aint mad at it... these owners will flip on you in a second... get that money young man lol@CarlosAntunes @SacramentoKings @swipathefox @hbarnes @dameology I've read that Sabonis Will play tonight. Don't know if thats true or not, but if he plays, Neemy does not stands a chance I think.@Matt_Barnes22 @SacramentoKings Still Sick to my stomach. Haliburton was the guy you keep at all costs, you don’t get rid of that guy. Figure out a way to pair sabonis/Hali together. That’s what should’ve happened@Matt_Barnes22 @SacramentoKings Still really hurts tbh. But if nobody wanted Fox then Tyrese was the only person who could bring us back something of real value like that.@Mrsmac10 @SacramentoKings Agreed. I just think everyone hated it had to be Hali@Matt_Barnes22 @SacramentoKings I wish the team would’ve got moved so I had a product I can cheer for! Sabonis is overrated and is now the WORST defender on our team of bad defenders WAY TO GO Monte! I hate Vivek he should sell the team and if anyone sees Fox in person tell him thanks for forcing a trade! Jerk!@J_Mo_45 @SacramentoKings Very talented but he ain’t going nowhere now. This is his team..@Matt_Barnes22 @SacramentoKings Can someone teach our guy fox how to close out.@Matt_Barnes22 @SacramentoKings Feel that we’re a better team today with the moves we made.@Matt_Barnes22 @SacramentoKings The head is ready, the heart hurts.The @SacramentoKings we’re battling for the worst franchise in professional sports and now they can take the crown by trading a cornerstone player like Halliburton in a brutal trade with Pacers.  That city deserves better.  What a joke!  #NBA #Pacers #Kings@SacramentoKings @mypmstore Is Sabonis playing tonight ?!Kings forward Harrison Barnes reportedly remains trade candidate #Sacramento #Kings #NBA https://t.co/JtlPFv2JNI@Matt_Barnes22 @SacramentoKings Matt there are no kings fans left after yesterday to anwser this question 😂@Matt_Barnes22 @SacramentoKings Holmes has to be moved, no?@Matt_Barnes22 @SacramentoKings Change Had to happen…@Matt_Barnes22 @SacramentoKings Legit Fox been underrated... he another player I always said gotta realize its business.. and needs to leave Sac... he possibly could be somewhere tryna get a ship...@SacramentoKings fans after an emotional day, how y’all feeling today? Emotions aside? 
Personally wasn’t a fan of the move but I feel like it could work. Management needs to make one move for sure but possibly two, to make this make sense IMO

There is no reason why you trade a 21 year old with superstar potential! I believe the people running the Kings organization doesn’t care about winning, just putting product on the court to get money. https://t.co/wVgAfBbNcZ🏀NBA🏀 #NBA

You and Buddy were the Splash Brothers of the King's. You got traded because FOX was jealous of your combined talent on the team. He can't compete with you because he is not a team player.

out of Sacramento. Now I am a Pacer fan.I still can’t believe the Kings traded a guy that actually WANTED to be there and that was getting really, REALLY good

Not one person thinks this was a good move for Sacramento, what went wrong for them to decide to trade their best and most likeable asset in Tyrese Haliburton?@Flashbaka @JariLGK @SacramentoKings @Dsabonis11 @JustHolla7 @jlamb Haha lay off the weed. Cause no one across the league thought the kings would ever move haliburton and the pacers swung hali &amp; hield for Sabonis.

Time to move the hell on from Sacramento.@Matt_Barnes22 @SacramentoKings Do you think a big trade like todays has a mental impact on the remaining players and how they played tonight?The Kings FINALLY draft the right player and they only keep him for 1.5 seasons 😂

So young.@SacramentoKings @jlamb This looks like a mug shot.@Matt_Barnes22 @SacramentoKings They have got to get more outside shooters… that’s how the NBA rolls these days…So The Sacramento Kings have more trades to make. Why do I feel like they’re gonna trade Fox, Holmes, and Barnes for Dame, and Nurkic? Same prefers to be on the west coast. Unless GM BRON comes into affect.@SacramentoKings @Dsabonis11 @JustHolla7 @jlamb @david2315 Tyrese at the airport be like https://t.co/wEpItDoZlo@SacramentoKings @TyHaliburton22 my gf, as she watched shirts being thrown into crowd in 4Q: “this is the most energized ive seen the crowd all night.”

Love Sabonis, love Fox. The attitude though had shifted here in SAC to Hali being the better building block than Fox. Fans fell in love with him, and now he’s gone. I think we’re just all knee-jerk reacting and in our feelings@SacramentoKings @Dsabonis11 Ew.

I wanna square up with who made that trade@SacramentoKings @TyHaliburton22 You know it's a terrible move when even Lakers fans are feeling bad for Kings fans.

Y’all got any shooters left ?@SacramentoKings @TyHaliburton22 Just solidifying that I should never buy a Kings jersey again… every time I think we have a franchise guy to build around, and I feel comfortable buying their jersey, you guys just ship them out of town before I can get the chance to enjoy the jersey.

Good luck in Indiana they got a future star@TyHaliburton22 Thank you so much for everything! Kings fans love you so much and we’re very grateful for you giving your all for Sacramento and how much you embraced Sacramento.

Just a absolute horrible product this organization has put up on the floor …. Stop buying tickets kings fans, let them hear us!!The Utah #Jazz remain among teams to watch in trade discussions for #Kings forward Harrison Barnes, per league source.

We’ll miss the heck out of you in Sacramento. This fanbase appreciated you so much more than this trash organization. Good luck in Indy!@SacramentoKings i might be done with y’all …@NESTVOFFICIVL @SacramentoKings Seems like a great deal for the kings . Hield overpaid and not in his prime anymore . Sabonis underpaid and about 5 years left of his prime.

Make the call.@SacramentoKings @Dsabonis11 Hope you can resign him but prepare to change your offense. He is a point center who is very unselfish.@MarcosBreton @SacramentoKings I’m not a kings fan but my immediate reaction was that this was a good trade for them. Everyone is acting like Tyreese is already a perennial all star. Fox is the perfect example of why he may not be. Kings had to take a risk to try and become relevant. Only time will tell.@SacramentoKings y’all really so backwards right when I started to fw y’all which I do fw y’all more than the warriors y’all do some shit that a 2k cpu franchise team would only accept https://t.co/0yjZlIUoCRmonte mcnair is an absolute idiot @SacramentoKingsThe Sacramento Kings are the Detroit Lions of the NBA@SacramentoKings do you guys wanna win any games .

I could be wrong thoughThe Sacramento Kings have made a major move but with the NBA trade deadline still a day and a half away, there may be more moves on the way.

Kings Trade Tyrese Haliburton for Domantas Sabonis (via @ZachCiavoNBA) https://t.co/xUHqq4zY7xWould you rather play for the Sacramento Kings or Indiana Pacers. Armpit marketsI am convinced @SacramentoKings won this trade purely based on all media crapping on it. Essentially saying that Fox and Sabonis are trash in this trade. Both will play with chips on their shoulders. Wishful thinking? Maybe. But no way is national media going to give us credit...Being a Sacramento kings fan in insane thing to choose to be . We’re all insane lolMonte McNair makes his first big trade as the Sacramento Kings trade Tyrese Haliburton for Domantas Sabonis in a six-player deal.

Kings are better with this trade@SactownKingsFan @SacramentoKings @tonal So How is tonal??Look, as a @SacramentoKings fan, I’ve got scars. Lots. Of. Scars. Trading Tyrese Haliburton triggered in me some very bad memories of past front office miscarriages of judgement. The Kings get the best player in the trade, no doubt. I want Monty to turn it around. Hope he doesThe @SacramentoKings easily the worst run franchise in the @NBA…. Could they be the worst in all of SPORTS

Yep, yep they most certain “win”

Not a team player.@isaiah_ad @SacramentoKings @Dsabonis11 legally they can't trade him back from the pacers so they should trade Haliburton the 76ers for one game and trade him back to us.@Erocksreef @SacramentoKings @Dsabonis11 @JustHolla7 @jlamb I think the problem is we have been bad for so long some have got used to just rooting for players, instead of the team.

Sabonis will create spacing for Fox &amp; Davion. Kings will open up the the paint with 3&amp;D wings for Sabonis to go to work. If he’s doubled he’s a good passer and will find the open man. Not to mention we got rid of Buddy.@mmcnair 👍@SacramentoKings @Dsabonis11 @JustHolla7 @jlamb Absolute trash!  These types of moves will keep that multi million dollar building empty!The Kings and Pacers have a combined record of 39-72. So why not make a trade?

No wonder @espn thinks you're a joke franchise.@moJOE_49 @Sports1140KHTK @Timberwolves @SacramentoKings not an intern...just a guy who gets off work before the injury report is released👍@andrejamal79  Sacramento Kings really traded Tyrese Haliburton to the Indiana Pacers. That was a bad move. I can see them wanting to get rid of Buddy Hield, but Haliburton is going to be a star. SMHHaven’t watched a @SacramentoKings game all season, pretty much. I like the direction this team is moving in. FINALLY!@SacramentoKings you IDIOTS gave up on Haliburton too quickly 🤦🏽‍♂️ https://t.co/sMZ2zEuvfnWhile we get rid of the Sacramento Kings, let’s also get rid of the Morris brothers https://t.co/u0bEMWV0guThis is only getting worse, attendance is really bad, makes me sick when contrasting to the opening of G1C 😥 @CarmichaelDave #sacramentokings #SacramentoProud #attendance https://t.co/tTq49zUUT4Why don’t the Sacramento Kings relocate?@TyHaliburton22 thanks for every smile and hustle play in a @SacramentoKings uniform
 Your joy was a daily inspiration. All the best in Indy!@JRSportBrief just said the Sacramento Kings are the Houston Texans of the NBA LMAOOO IM DEAD BUT WAS THIS NECESSARY THO🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣@SacramentoKings if this trade doesn’t work out for the better you owe me season tickets.

Kings FO: OK

Kp:  uhh ok, didn't think it would be that easy 🤔@swipathefox You we’re sitting out of the lineup waiting for your @SacramentoKings teammates to get traded, shame on you.

Fox sits for 10 games, as soon as Halliburton is traded, he’s magically healed

I see what you did there @SacramentoKings👍 on @YouTube: Sacramento Kings vs Minnesota Timberwolves - Postgame LIVE at Punch Bowl Social https://t.co/g4kHZKp8Wi@SacramentoKings @Verizon @swipathefox @hoopculture13 @hbarnes @moe_harkless @dameology Where’s hali and buddy? 🧐Domantas Sabonis is really close with Luka Dončić and is already texting him to come to Sacramento. They were both born in Europe and have been best friends since Luka came to the league. 

Sabonis and Luka on the kings would be dangerous 👀@SacramentoKings @CoorsLight @swipathefox He’s our guy now@stephenson9595 @SacramentoKings @Dame_Lillard Why would Dame want to come to Sacramento as if Portland isn’t bad enough@SacramentoKings just lose@TheNBACentral @AhnFireDigital @SacramentoKings is a dumbass franchise. They traded away a guy genuinely wants to play for them. And you don't see a lot of guys say "I wanna play for the Sacramento Kings"hes consistent like this every game. lock down defender and elite shooter.
