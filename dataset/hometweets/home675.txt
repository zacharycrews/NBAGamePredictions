https://t.co/HuewKGqquf https://t.co/14v0B5tsmcThere are two big events in Uptown tonight - the @NASCARHall of Fame Induction Ceremony and @hornets vs @okcthunder.

The Charlotte Hornets are a small market team, the players they'll be able to sign will always be limited. However, there are other small markets that have shown that you can trade for guys, win there and they want to stay.Our first #BestBets play of the day is the Charlotte Hornets -9.5 VS Thunder
-Hornets have covered in 6 of their L7 (BOS, NYK, PHI, MIL twice)
-14-4 ATS at home
-In L3, CHA has 6th best defense in NBA

[via r/charlottehornets Jan 21, 2018 #Hornets]With that said, I'm taking the rest of the week off. I've been working, but haven't even thought about streaming or making content since Tuesday.
Headed to the @hornets game tonight with my Wife and kid. Then spending some time with friends tomorrow.
See y'all Sunday.@CrownClubCLT @NWNFantasy @kkdreamss @8Fourteen @sixers @JoelEmbiid A fucking Hornets fan talking about attendance holy shit. NOLA and Charlotte are the corniest basketball towns in the US. How dare you call Philly fans bandwagons because they didn’t spend time and money on this team when they were literally openly intentionally losing?.@macwfnz and @TBoneWFNZ talk about the notion that the Hornets have become a bigger deal in Charlotte than college basketball, ask the audience about the best TV dramas and tell you why they think Tim Kelly is the best of the OC options.
