Chicago Bulls ($3.8B) https://t.co/mXmsKmAkfp@DobackDave @nickdelpizzahut @celtics try your other burner account "Dave"@RealNYCopinionz @Patty_Nasty @celtics Cry about it@celtics elbowed in the face by Lopez on the dunk and obviously no whistle@Lakeshow93_ @MagicJohnson @JeanieBuss @PelicansNBA @nyknicks @celtics @Pacers My point is that’s in the past. To compete and win now, she has to live in the present and operate in a world of how things are, not how they were. That means constantly evolving and growing. And honestly, love Kobe, but his cap-killer contract in his last few years led us hereSo are the refs in NHL and NBA paid bonuses for calling penalties and fouls against Boston? @NHLBruins @celtics@_JasonLT Al Horford made 5 ——3-pointers off 7 attempts, GAME-CHANGER nobody expected from the Boston Celtics Center position. 👎
Only reason Milwaukee Bucks lost.@KevinBoston25 @celtics I know it! Crazy.@TheMarcMonge @MagicJohnson @JeanieBuss This guy wasn’t in the 80s either bro. Lakers adapt and always help grow the league . Have some respect , this isn’t no @PelicansNBA , @nyknicks , @celtics @Pacers  basketball . More rings in these last 22 years then all these teams combined . https://t.co/kM8n6hAcDw🎥 Ramon Rivas and I discussed his playing days with Larry Bird and the @celtics. 

🎙 Rivas was a beast for @TUMBBHoops in the late 80s. One of the greatest A10 teams of all-time. More to come from my interview with @JuanRiv01583332 https://t.co/7sE18O2YzXI don’t usually watch sports but when I do it’ll be basketball during playoffs and last night’s game was so good! #BostonCeltics@Molanski13 @BillSimmons @celtics @Lakers @NBA Maybe you don’t get it, because all the other incompetent owners, the Lakers share their earnings who are not making money. Buss biz is the Lakers and this is not a toy for them. So they do have to watch their money going into luxury tax. They made the wrong choice with Caruso.@PritchBurner @Pavel9792 @TrolledByKevin @celtics @not_pritchard @LeTimelordd @Klouie_11 @ChiefKeef Become a Bucks slander account and you're good in my bookI am a time traveler. On June 16th 2022 The Boston Celtics will defeat the Golden State Warriors in game 6 of the NBA Finals to win their 18th NBA championship. #celtics@Pavel9792 @TrolledByKevin @celtics lmao lemme ask someone else. @not_pritchard @LeTimelordd @AlecNSG @Klouie_11 @ChiefKeef what we thinkin?@PritchBurner @TrolledByKevin @celtics lmfao, i don't know what to say lol@Molanski13 @BillSimmons @celtics @Lakers And bump your LA stuff because if it was only about location then he could have gone to the Clippers. Richer owner and all and according to your standards better run org.@KomasanTweets @TrolledByKevin @celtics lmao@TrolledByKevin @celtics wtf. @Pavel9792 what you think?Boston Celtics: #Celtics Even Series, Head Home for Game 5 in Boston https://t.co/DRR2EfbsH3@sifuwes Call me the #celticbird after #larrybird of the #BostonCeltics. Fits in well with a handful of Robins, a bat, and a Nightwing. I'm on lookout! #batman #dccomics #knightwatch #batcowl #BatCowlGang https://t.co/bkn959icio@celtics The glue of the organization@sportsguygio @celtics Hell yeah you know everyone would be wearing em’!@Molanski13 @BillSimmons @celtics @Lakers Should have paid IT before he got injured not the trade. @AntDavis23 father talked about that on why he wouldn’t come to Boston. Also every other team asks their fading stars to take pay cuts. Not @lakers and even if it means they are going to suck for a bit. They owe it to them@celtics how about his careless passCan someone explain to me how the #Warriors franchise is worth more than my #Lakers ? Or even those leprechauns up in Boston? #Celtics 

Its Not a diss. Im just genuinely confused 😕@celtics When’s Marcus Smart night? — a sea of free green wigs all over the GardenBoston Celtics NBA Mini Hoops

The Lakers have all that and they are STILL incompetent!

Imagine making the most money in the league but letting Caruso walk! There's only ONE team in the NBA that would have done that.@markla1979 @BillSimmons @celtics @Lakers You're delusional. LeBron wanted to go to the Lakers because they are in LA and that's where he needs to be for business.

Everyone would have done the Thomas trade. Only a moron thinks their team wouldn't have done it in the same situation.I wonder if the @celtics are the best in the history of NBA in other universes like they are in ours 🤔@LayinLow407 @celtics @Al_Horford @ArbellaIns I would say 15 seasons, 950 games played constitues Vet statusCheck out 2020-21 PANINI PRIZM FLASHBACK JAYSON TATUM BOSTON CELTICS CHROME.

Makes the most money, merchandise, most watched, has the most nat TV games. Must suck to be an incompetent. Truth is, people rag on Lakers just cuz of who they are. No one’s is making tv shows about the @celtics@SuspendedTommy 😂😂😂 tommy going through witness protection hiding from Al Horford and the Boston Celtics.Al Horford is a rock for the Boston Celtics https://t.co/ZVZwrcZXwUThe @celtics made today better.@Molanski13 @BillSimmons @celtics @Lakers Kobe contract is what the @Lakers have always done. They take care of their stars. This is why Lebron wanted to come here or any stars. Better than what @celtics did to Paul Pierce and Isiah Thomas. Sure there was missteps but no franchise is batting 1000.Al Horford is a rock for the Boston Celtics https://t.co/vlBsV7NWU0@BK62660268 @Patriots878 @Max_Lederman No, no. Boston Celtics have by far the worst, most toxic and most deluded fanbase in all of world sport. So don't come  throwing stones when you live in a glass fucking palace lol
You must be about 50 then if you've seen more than 1 Celtics Championship haha@VanCollegeCav @warriors @StephenCurry30 @celtics @NBA Ha ha.  That was awesome!  Called his shot!@markla1979 @BillSimmons @celtics @Lakers Have a look at their last decade or so. Kobe contract. Magic resigning to the media. Zubac trade. Westbrook trade. Caruso contract. Wrong date on the Davis trade. Missed the playoffs twice with LeBron.

The list goes on. They just got lucky in that LeBron wanted to go to LA.@natedog4133 @DAvanzoDrexler @celtics Respect 🙏@reed_oc @DAvanzoDrexler @celtics Thank Yu 🙏@DAvanzoDrexler @celtics Because I respect the Celtics pussy 😂
