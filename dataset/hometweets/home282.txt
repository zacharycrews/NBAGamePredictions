#MagicTogether #OrlandoMagic #NBA https://t.co/LFvfDoBbIzI really enjoyed this look at Nikola Vucevic's return to Orlando tonight. It was very cool to see him detail the trade process that sent him to Chicago. Also, the Magic are getting a rep for really taking care of players. That's a good thing long-term.

Used to love watching Penny Hardaway! Play that sticks in my mind was when he did spin move at baseline to get away from Pippen and was going up for a layup. Jordan was probably going to block him and he dished to Horace G for big dunk!

It’s a building year. Losing isn’t ideal, but it’s a way to grow. One thing it teaches is to forget about the last game and move forward. It also teaches you what NOT to do lol.
