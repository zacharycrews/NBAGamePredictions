#KnicksNew York Knicks vs Washington Wizards is on MSG Network. Co-commentator is Walt Frazier.  For more details see https://t.co/YhWCq3qVmR #NewYorkKnicks #WashingtonWizards #MSGNetworkThe #Knicks have 18 Offensive Rebounds. The #Wizards have 25 Defensive Rebounds.
If the Knicks miss a shot tonight, it's nearly as likely that they grab the rebound as Washington.
Overall, the Knicks with a 53-27 rebounding advantage.The Wizards' defense has been solid tonight, but it's the offense that's been the issue. Washington went 6 for 19 from the field and 4 for 8 from the free-throw line in the third quarter, scoring just 19 points. Washington trails New York 75-66 heading into the fourth.@wfuvsports AT THE END OF THE THIRD...

Knicks-75
Wizards-66

Randle has 16 pts &amp; 15 rebs and three other Knicks (Burks, Quickley, &amp; Fournier) in double figures.

Washington still has only one player (Porzingis) with double digit points.
