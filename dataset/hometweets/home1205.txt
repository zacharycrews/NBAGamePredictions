That's the business side of it.@DerozanFan10 @Cryptoveer1 @NBA @AschNBA @Raptors Yes because we already know Cade gets no love anyway.

Keep an eye on the injury reports for Rockets vs Raptors. I still think we still perform well on B2B, with only a few key players (presumably) https://t.co/DP3Vx2bSsoWe've been giving the #Celtics their due praise all year, but have we been talking enough about the @Raptors? 

On 1/29 Toronto was 23-23, they've since gone 24-10 and are now 5th in the East.

Sixers will win their last two against the Pacers and Pistons at home and Boston will lose to Memphis on the road. This will give Toronto - Boston and Philly - Chicago.Sports outlets never like to give the @Raptors credit, but I'm going to laugh at yall SUCKAZ, cuz the Raps can beat the 76ers, and The Bucks. The Heat and Celtics is my only concern in the East #NBA #RaptorsIt‚Äôs a big weekend for sports so I dug out this favourite @Raptors @BlueJays #Masters https://t.co/48ttqqaijMJays are predicted to be the 2nd best team.

First, Barnes have similar numbers even though he's not option 1,2 or 3.  Second, he's playing with an All-Star and a SUPERSTAR.  Put some damn respect. @RaptorsSo, the Celtics play the @Raptors full squad in Toronto, with only one starter, and take them to overtime. Now, they play the @Bucks full squad in Milwaukee with only 2 starters, and almost win the game, but I'm supposed to be worried about who we face in the playoffs? #TheyComin@gjjm_ @MapleLeafs @Raptors @BlueJays They will be added to the list in due time.

That offensive foul called on Scottie in the 3rd was just ridiculous.@wensparks @Raptors I am excited for them, I love seeing Chris and Pascal, they seem to have a great connection.

Precious has grown so much, loved the fight in him.@UK_Bucks @Raptors Saw something other week regarding a poll taken at Allstar weekend where players voted the Raps the team they least wanted to face.

#NBA75 https://t.co/O76yB91z3u@LakeShowBoss @notlakersgm @Raptors Well I think the only reason why he was trying to ask for more last yr is because the Lakers seemed desperate. But now it's a deal that goes into the off season and Rob can look at him and say hey you need a 3rd guy for Fred and Pascal. Not like they're a 1 seed.@CSmoove_Sports @notlakersgm @Raptors Masai is a great GM, so yeah I don't trust him to help the Lakers@NBA @pskills43 @Raptors When the Raptors play like a team passing the ball makes them a better team. If Fred keeps shooting instead of facilitating then they are not good. Fred did not play and they got a great win against the sixers. Fred hugs the ball too much and forcing shots even well covered@wensparks @Raptors That was a given in my view.

Home Court in the first round is actually still possible.

The Toronto #Raptors will have to WIN their two final games (vs HOU &amp; @ NYK) and Philly will have to LOSE their final two games (vs IND &amp; vs DET)

It probably won't happen. But it's still possible. #WeTheNorth@CornerPubSports Toronto defends Embiid better than any other team in the league. Didn‚Äôt help that Harden and Harris played poorly.
