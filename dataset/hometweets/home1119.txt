Luka Doncic Over 28.5 Points -115 (Dallas Mavericks)

Luka has enjoyed succes vs Utah L2 seasons / the playoff type of atmosphere should also play in Luka's favor 

*fwiw the game he scored 23 this season in late Feb he shot 33% https://t.co/bC8bPM4lrEIf @Sampsonite41 was REALLY my boy, he‚Äôd take me to the @dallasmavs vs @Lakers next Tuesday.Dallas Mavericks - Utah Jazz
