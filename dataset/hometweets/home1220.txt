Well done ü§£@nbaraw @hhpthebook @nyknicks The draft is always a crap shoot. IMO TH was the better pick, but if you look at adv metrics Obi was still a good pick at 8.

If we can bring him in cheap (impossible), has had a lot of lower body structural issues, not good for a man of his size. I'm okay with it if the Knicks don't lose picks and/or throws them in cap hell,@knicks81 @nyknicks What a shitty photoshop, the Knicks don't even wear those jerseys anymore so that's not what Zion would rock if he came to NY@knicks81 @nyknicks Yeah &amp; that's where it's gonna stay hopefully@NYK_forever @knicks81 @nyknicks We finally agree on something.@knicks81 @nyknicks You know RJ better then Zion right? This team uses bandades, should have never signed Julius. Build through draft, only way.

Essence of good basketball: to see each other and to make the ball available, unselfishly to your teammate.  The team that can create avenues to get to the basket and share the basketball, can create runs also.  Like the 1970 and 1973 New York Knicks.@knicks81 @nyknicks That‚Äôs a dream knicks team if it happens. One can dream.These @chicagobulls, @Coinbase_NFT, and artist collaborations are going to be üî•!
