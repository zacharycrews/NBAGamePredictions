Kid is talented but he has to improve on AoT of areas 
Zion on the other hand was already a superstar the moment he touched an NBA court 
Every team in the league would choose Zion over RJ at this very momentEver wanted to hear what New York Knicks president Leon Rose sounds like? Well here he is talking about the Knicks this season 👇

Well done 🤣@nbaraw @hhpthebook @nyknicks The draft is always a crap shoot. IMO TH was the better pick, but if you look at adv metrics Obi was still a good pick at 8. IQ was one of the top 3 steals. Grimes and Sims also look like steals. Mitch a huge steal (but likely gone). RJ looks like a 3rd pick lately.@knicks81 @nyknicks I’m gonna retweet this and leave it right there@TheCenterForwa1 @rhombusleech @loucityfc @nyknicks Kyle Morton is a DeBusschere-type, right?@knicks81 @nyknicks This is what's on my wishlist for the NBA off-season@knicks81 @nyknicks No thanks. Zion can't get on the court. Last thing we need is an injury prone star that will satisfy the fans cuz every year we'll have hope he plays.@MikeWattsOnAir @rhombusleech @loucityfc And here I was about to make a comparison to the @loucityfc defense and the 1969 @nyknicks ...@nyknicks @NerlensNoel3 HAPPY BIRTHDAY@NYK_forever @knicks81 @nyknicks Figures you would come up with nonsense like that. Again think before you post@knicks81 @nyknicks Are we bringing in Coach K too?

If we can bring him in cheap (impossible), has had a lot of lower body structural issues, not good for a man of his size. I'm okay with it if the Knicks don't lose picks and/or throws them in cap hell,@knicks81 @nyknicks What a shitty photoshop, the Knicks don't even wear those jerseys anymore so that's not what Zion would rock if he came to NY@knicks81 @nyknicks Yeah &amp; that's where it's gonna stay hopefully@NYK_forever @knicks81 @nyknicks We finally agree on something.@knicks81 @nyknicks You know RJ better then Zion right? This team uses bandades, should have never signed Julius. Build through draft, only way. 

#NYSM #NYK@knicks81 @nyknicks It’s giving kd/kyrie vibes@nyknicks @NerlensNoel3 He's exactly two months older than me but same age after mine June 10 1994. HBD Noel. Stay healthy brother.

And his attitude has been abysmal. He doesn't even dress in the locker room with his own team. That says alot.@NA_Dellsey @Dreshaaw @knicks81 @nyknicks Yes we know that but when he is his way betterNew York KnicksAbsolutely loved @NYRangers last night and Cannot wait for @nyknicks tonight.

They have sucked all year. He shot 27.3%. He played horribly against Washington and Orlando all year. Thats alot more than 1 game. So, your allowed to focus on one game, but i am not? 🤣@knicks81 @nyknicks The 3 Dukes of NY@knicks81 @nyknicks Did you not watch Obi drop 35? Why would you want that undersized, out of shape, no defense playing man? He cant even get on the court. We already got a big 3 in Rj, Obi, and Quick. Cam and the other young guys are just icing on the cake@knicks81 @nyknicks They didn’t even win at Duke. Stop. Zion sitting in a chair. Get used to it@KarlARi53281888 @knicks81 @nyknicks Comparing college ball to the NBA 🤡@knicks81 @nyknicks No thanks. Didn’t like the product or results in college. Hasn’t gotten better in the pros@isabellalexande @knicks81 @nyknicks You clearly didn’t watch these 3 play at Duke 🤡🤡https://t.co/cy68RVQJSu

Essence of good basketball: to see each other and to make the ball available, unselfishly to your teammate.  The team that can create avenues to get to the basket and share the basketball, can create runs also.  Like the 1970 and 1973 New York Knicks.@knicks81 @nyknicks That’s a dream knicks team if it happens. One can dream.These @chicagobulls, @Coinbase_NFT, and artist collaborations are going to be 🔥! 

If we bring this to NY, I hope the @nyknicks don’t leave me out! Been working this angle.

The New York Knicks did it in 1969-70 and went on to win the championship. https://t.co/Lt20HBjYBi@sportscashlife @BostonKnick @rahmmagick @nyknicks Be easy with the Frank slander, the Frank-hive is watching 🤣@TheNBACentral My god Randle and Westbrick in New York would be the most inefficient shooting and shitshow in knicks history and that is saying something.@WhiteMike527 @nyknicks He def is rn lol@BostonKnick @hhpthebook @rahmmagick @nyknicks The Magnificent Seven. And I want to keep them all and add to them.  It is important now that they get this next pick right. They can find a superstar from their draft position. I don’t know who it is but we can’t have another Frank over Donovan Mitchell result again.@metrbocker @SheridanFinAid @PeterVecsey1 @WaltFrazier @nyknicks Even as a big Lakers fan, Moses Malone was one of my favorite players . He didn’t sign a ton. Chasing him(and Bird) for autographs was always entertaining .@knicks81 @nyknicks This is cool but lets have RJ in the middle cuz the knicks are his team@knicks81 @nyknicks RJ in the middle and Zion needs a different number because #1 is spoken for!Welp another @nyknicks season will be in the books. We’ll finish under 500 again. But you know what?!. WE TAKIN IT NEXT SEASON!!!@georgesands58 @SheridanFinAid @PeterVecsey1 @WaltFrazier @nyknicks The autograph industry ruined a lot of relationships btw players and fans. Instead of kids you to have 50-year-old men hounding players everywhere to sign on the sweet spot or sign five to sell somewhere. 

Patrick like that he’d shake your hand but not sign. In private he’s nice@knicks81 @nyknicks RJ definitely gotta be at the head of the table.@georgesands58 @SheridanFinAid @PeterVecsey1 @WaltFrazier @nyknicks you’re right especially— at shows I imagine. people don’t understand often auto snub is matter of timing/schedule. Need to warm up or be somewhere etc, or just for kids. I don’t know him other than chatting at MSG/ restaurant but Clyde is just a class act above and beyond.@knicks81 @nyknicks You can please take this shit the fuck back. Early 20’s with foot and diet problems is a legitimate recipe for disaster. Which is like a bullseye for the Knicks front office for whatever reason…@FortyEightMins @Raptors @nyknicks @nbatopshot @NBA TS: Dubs_1Bounced back pretty damn quickly.

@NBA@knicksill @nyknicks @KnicksMSGN @TheGarden @AlecBurks10 @jbryant3 Thibs is only coaching for himself and his personal coaching record. That’s why he doesn’t want to develop.

Mets/Giants...@hhpthebook @nyknicks You’re wearing a Yankee hat in your bio bruh@nyjSean @nyknicks Facts@Darryl1960 @nyknicks I'm boooo'ing everyone today. Booooooooo@hhpthebook @nyknicks Knicks need to keep this group of players. It’s a start of something big.@hhpthebook @nyknicks drafting great late too, getting some real gems tho way robinson has played the past few years, can def argue he’d be an early first or mid at least.@hhpthebook @nyknicks I hate to be Contrarian Conrad...but it will be a few years before we say the Knicks "crushed" the draft. 
Let's see the team finish over .500 before we start
anointing the team the next big thing. 
I mean last year Julius Randle was an All-Star.

Let my disfunction be🤣🤣@h2sdrummer @jesusshuttlez @hhpthebook @nyknicks Orrrrr just maybe or? Great states doesn’t lead to a winning culture? Monti Ellis, Michael Carter-Williams, Josh Smith, all talented players who can’t help a team win. Not saying that’ll be him, but it’s not like his style of play produces wins for kings or pacers@hhpthebook @nyknicks You've got a Yankees baseball cap on your head in your profile pic.@Emmellene That would be extra lit tho. We could use @MetLifeStadium stadium for a @nyknicks game and(or) @BrooklynNetsWhere in New York would be fun to watch Raptors vs. Knicks tomorrow other than MSG? Why are tickets still so expensive??? people should be boycotting the Knicks in solidarity with Stephen A.@DannyEskdale @nyknicks Thank you so much for buying and reading!
