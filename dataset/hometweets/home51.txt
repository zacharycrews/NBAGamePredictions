San Antonio Spurs – Los Angeles Lakers
San Antonio Spurs +4@GuruLakers Coach Vogel looking at this game as a statement win for his Twin Towers 1st Unit. Will step to the podium and brag, “My Twin Towers lineup beat San Antonio Spurs even without Lebron James, PATIENCE.”A lot of fans unjustly felt animosity towards DeMar when he joined the Spurs. Most of that likely stemmed from him failing to meet the lofty standards Kawhi set in San Antonio. And the residual anger following Leonard's exit didn't help them embrace DeRozan as his replacement.ALERT: New high roller bet posted!
