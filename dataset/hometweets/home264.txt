And of course, it's here in Oregon. 🏀🍷 Interview by @pdxpamar: https://t.co/iKcjj3PIp3@mcten Linking the Thunder/Rockets/Trail Blazers Melo is a pretty poor review.

It was his 2 years in Portland that is the entire basis of your article for his resurgence as a reserve player in which he got the new moniker "Skinny Melo."You’re probably already familiar with @CJMcCollum the superstar @trailblazers guard. But what about CJ McCollum the winemaker?

if you are completing now this has $.43 CS/cost https://t.co/jyjW29iqS6@liam_oshea33 @SacramentoKings @memgrizz @trailblazers @DetroitPistons @PelicansNBA @Pacers Yeah, I just don’t see it happening really. Not during this season at least. Likely dealing exclusively with the TPE if they feel like they want to make a major addition. They can stack up some of the smaller salaries to make some things work too, I guess.@Birdstache @SacramentoKings @memgrizz @trailblazers @DetroitPistons @PelicansNBA @Pacers Not right now at least but he’s our only real sizable contract outside of smart and horford and those two aren’t going anywhere@Birdstache @SacramentoKings @memgrizz @trailblazers @DetroitPistons @PelicansNBA @Pacers Yeah I mean if he costs much more than jrich, nesmith, and maybe a future first I wouldn’t do it but he is very good at what he does and provides more size@liam_oshea33 @SacramentoKings @memgrizz @trailblazers @DetroitPistons @PelicansNBA @Pacers Don’t want to trade JRich tho.@liam_oshea33 @SacramentoKings @memgrizz @trailblazers @DetroitPistons @PelicansNBA @Pacers I dont like jerami because I think he’s a role player who will cost a superstar price. JRich can be traded today, the e tension wasn’t a big enough raise to trigger that rule.@Birdstache @SacramentoKings @memgrizz @trailblazers @DetroitPistons @PelicansNBA @Pacers I like jerami but can we actually get him? I though Richardson was unable to be traded this regular season because of his extension@liam_oshea33 @SacramentoKings @memgrizz @trailblazers @DetroitPistons @PelicansNBA @Pacers The thinking was jerami and zion but I’m actually not much into either.@Birdstache @SacramentoKings @memgrizz @trailblazers @DetroitPistons @PelicansNBA @Pacers Who are you trying to get from the pistons and pels?@Birdstache @SacramentoKings @memgrizz @trailblazers @DetroitPistons @PelicansNBA @Pacers He made a shot, as I understand it! Don’t worry about anything elseHey @SacramentoKings @memgrizz @trailblazers @DetroitPistons @PelicansNBA @Pacers did you see the first one minute, and only the first minute of Aaron nesmiths game today?All power rankings have the 76ers at the top, except for one 👀

Change the game
Don't let the game change damePortland Trail Blazers Point Guard Damian Lillard is the Western Conference Player of the Week.@NBA @trailblazers @Bucks Dame? Steph averaged 30 idc if he got it last weekPortland Trail Blazers guard Damian Lillard and Milwaukee Bucks forward Giannis Antetokounmpo have been named the NBA Western and Eastern Conference Players of the Week, respectively, for Week 5 of the 2021-22 season (Nov. 15-21). #NBA75 #NBAAfrica https://t.co/x8mkSmvqD7@Holla_At_Rob33 @trailblazers @DIRECTV Nobody can get root though.@NBAPR @trailblazers @Dame_Lillard @Bucks @Giannis_An34 Yet just a couple days ago doubled over in pain making a lay up.
I think it goes against Lillard making it sound like he’s back,yeah,now
expect 30 points nightly.
Yes this is lovely to award him this but he is one tear away from losing the season. He is not healed.@TimAlberta The northernmost NBA team is the Portland Trail Blazers@NBACobwebs The @trailblazers were approaching the 150 point mark and the fans were getting excited about it, so Moe told his team to "... part the seas," adding "... there wasn't much difference in that defense and the one we had before."  Portland would finish with 156 points535 of those wins came coaching the @trailblazers.  Congrats Nate! https://t.co/SguqBJyraO@BillsBetta @alsouqi_omar @trailblazers @aldridge_12 What a score@Justin_Flight @trailblazers @Dame_Lillard @NBA 🤷🏻‍♂️ yeah he’s alrightFlight booked. Flying out to LA to watch my @trailblazers go against Lakers. This is gonna be the 5th arena I’ve seen them play at, and I can’t wait. 

If I somehow get my @Dame_Lillard jersey signed after trying 4 other times, it will be an even bigger success.@NBAPR @trailblazers @Dame_Lillard @Bucks @Giannis_An34 Steph avg 30+ n had better avrgs from everywhere on the court?Larry Nance Jr.’s Improvement Aligns With Winning Blazers Basketball: Photo by Sam Forencich/NBAE via Getty Images The summer’s big trade acquisition is beginning to pay dividends.
