Last year it was Giannis.The Bucks potentially winning 3 series all on the road after the first round would be legendary

Yes they are the favorites but that still is a tough road

Suns, Grizzlies, Warriors, Heat, Mavs all have HC advantage over Milwaukee@Bucks Honestly, how poetic is it that Holiday made two of the most clutch defensive plays against the supposed DPOY.@Bucks Finish on Defense🏀😎@Bucks I'm from the Midwest born and raised .. it wouldn't be right if it wasn't@SSGMckay @Bucks You are not that guys.....10. GIANNIS ANTETOKOUNMPO – $80.9 MILLION

Antetokounmpo is the list’s youngest athlete. The 27-year-old is a two-time MVP who signed a five-year, $228 million contract with the Milwaukee Bucks last December.

That is the largest contract in NBA history in terms of value. https://t.co/aV4geR0WiKCheck out Giannis Antetokounmpo lot of 5 Different  2021 Panini Chronicles Cards #MilwaukeeBucks https://t.co/et77tbU07o via @eBaytoday’s the day the milwaukee bucks advance to the eastern conference finals@Bucks @Giannis_An34 hope you seeing this https://t.co/oRpqe6ln9A@tonyelgringo12 @Heat4life01 @Bucks Our respective twitter communities rn up until the Celtics/bucks series over. https://t.co/loojCHVuWcCeltics @ Bucks

It would take a lot for Boston to return from their Game 5 heartbreak.

The Bucks are 1-6-1 ATS in their last 8 home games, and Boston is 5-0-1 in their previous games at Milwaukee.

I expect a monster effort from the #GreekFreak.

That's going to be really meaningful considering Lowry's injury and the physicality of Bucks-Celtics.

But man... going from Philly's defense to Boston's or Milwaukee's is a serious jump.One last thing @Bucks DO NOT LET US WIN TOMORROW
