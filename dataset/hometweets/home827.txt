He would have gone straight to Philadelphia and I believe Simmons would thrive as the main guy on a bad Rockets team.👻 in 2012 Finals. Ruined the @HoustonRockets 👑 treatment. Ran thru thee greatest collection of teammates, 😮‍💨. ALL 👁️👁️ ON @JHarden13 https://t.co/17Lulv6xpZ@Malai61794 @HoustonRockets You casual. You’re comparing a Seth curry trade to Hardens. I know you’re salty &amp; those picks just became worse with Simmons in a nets uniformCould Christian Wood be traded? Despite the team's asking price being high, the Hornets are still in the running for him. Good player, just needs to get out of Houston. 

#NBA #NBA75 #CourtSideHeat #NBATradeDeadline #Rockets #AllFlyThis is a congratulations message for the Houston Rockets.

Congratulations, your picks from BKN got exponentially worse because Ben Simmons joins KD for the next 4 years. https://t.co/wlyZxXKw11@JSoles45 Like I told someone else.

Someone let him know he’s not gonna win that easy.@RafaelStone12 @HoustonRockets we are waiting….eric gordon and christian wood are houston rockets 🔥🔥🔥🔥HEY ONCE AGAIN @HoustonRockets WAKE UP@RooshWilliams Houston had no future at that point. Harden leaving was their entire nest egg. They gave up Chris Paul who would have no purpose being on this rebuilding rockets team and traded away Capela who wouldn’t fit on this current team. Harden gave them a hefty return regardless.Stone and the @HoustonRockets https://t.co/dsCLMH9RE4@thegeorgeyoung @HoustonRockets I told you that y’all wasn’t bro lol 😂Boy if yo ass dont make a move @HoustonRockets@suns just traded Ayton, crowder, jalen Smith, saric (buyout) and picks to the @Lakers for Anthony Davis. 

Trade on hold as both teams are trying to work a deal with @HoustonRockets to swap Westbrook for Wall and Christian Wood while Suns will be adding Eric Gordon. #WOJBOMB@KennyInHTown @Dune_in_Katy @DRDREon290 @SeanUnfiltered @JordanVsDream If the Nets or 76ers don't win an NBA Title at any point in the next few years, and it's the Houston Rockets building a championship roster loaded with elite young talent..

Personally I wouldn’t want Simmons in a rockets uniform. I’d sure love Seth but you traded him away 4 nada@Rockets_Insider Curious to hear why Houston fans would root for Harden? The organization did everything they could for him then he immediately bailed when he saw that he probably wasn’t gonna win in Houston. Literally stopped playing until he got what he wanted.

The team is doomed if today ends with Russ &amp; Vogel on roster.This just further cements how big of an L the Houston Rockets took last year. Cut off their nose to spite their face.

Harden requested trade out of Houston and wanted to be in Brooklyn. The Rockets old GM, Daryl Morey, is now in Philly. He traded for Harden once and now traded for him again. Harden was frustrated in Brooklyn.

That man deserves it@abehyde @HoustonRockets He’s a cancer to a rebuilding team looking for its identity. Selfish. Can’t play defense. Poor decision making. No court vision. Thinks he is 2017 Anthony Davis@HoustonRockets Seems like a pretty easy decision to us! 😉@clutchfans @HoustonRockets fucking move him up 😡According to @MattMooreTAN, the #Rockets have told teams they have two different offers of a 1st round pick for SG Eric Gordon. The problems are finding a team that won't send back significant salary, and Houston is looking for a pick in the teens instead of late 1st round. https://t.co/Ol50qUaIUM@scooperachi @HoustonRockets What’s wrong with himDamn , bring pat back  @HoustonRockets https://t.co/FDVOxoFxxC@HoustonRockets bro get him out of here https://t.co/R1prvOkawO@HoustonRockets @pizzahut Trade WoodCome out and celebrate another @HoustonRockets Remix Night! 🚀 Tonight’s game will honor Rockets legends Allen Leavell, Rodney McCray, and Robert Reid with limited-edition, signed posters created by Jack Massing.

His podcast provides a great way to quickly get introduced to a business!

(He did not tell me he was a rocket scientist!!!)Just remember that James Harden was an all star in Houston.
He was given every trade to get him to the top/ make him happy.
He walked away from the team that bent over backwards to make him a star in the league.
Now he’s tired of being 3rd fiddle in the #NetsWorld band.

Tough look. #Rockets https://t.co/i6WuBtPJHDI’m glad to be back in Houston and watch a #Rockets team WITHOUT James Harden, who has zero honor. It’s pretty amusing to see him once again act as if HOF teammates aren’t good enough for him.

But there’s a part of me that wants him traded back here for purgatory purposes.The streaking Raptors look to extend their run to 8 wins in a row as they take on the Houston Rockets and rookie Jalen Green. @RytheGuyNBA has your preview: https://t.co/6bkotnnSZlRevenge Game: Goran Dragic plays Houston tonight.  He played 88 games in his career for the Rockets.@MaximumGrindage @TrishRothgeb Yes. But at the same time it's not like we didn't know Kyrie was flakey. It's not like Houston John Wall-ed him and traded him unknowingly to a team he didn't want to go to. He knew Kyrie was there, we all know Kyrie's flakey...not rocket science. No pun intended.It is hilarious that Morey and Harden want to get back together after blowing up the Rockets. Morey let Harden do whatever he wanted in Houston and Harden was an MVP for Morey there, but still.Come on @HoustonRockets https://t.co/mgqS1vAaT1@JHarden13 wants out of Brooklyn but fears the public backlash of publicly asking for a trade again after last year's antics in Houston.

The Rockets want the Lakers' 2027 first-rounder. Russ would become a buyout candidate if such a trade ever went down. A DNP doesn't really factor in. https://t.co/ivBIJ9yvf0What To Expect From The Houston Rockets This Offseason https://t.co/U61wInQxzP@asoukuptx @BenDuBose @clutchfans Why would anyone want him back in Houston? He's declining physically and doesn't fit what the Rockets are currently building. They don't need a selfish diva in a locker room full of young guys. It'll kill chemistry/moralePlease trade Christian Wood @HoustonRocketsBoatos:

Westbrook 👉🏼 Houston Rockets
John Wall 👈🏼 LA Lakers 

#NBA #nbatradeyou too @warriors @LAClippers @Lakers @SacramentoKings @dallasmavs @HoustonRockets @memgrizz @PelicansNBA @spurs@Blaze_Gaming00 Yup. A lot of speculation surrounding James Harden, which is nothing new being a Houston Rockets fan. Harden and his camp keep things extremely close to chest. The months before his exit from Houston were just a rumor-filled extravaganza.Charges included $1,600 on Houston Rockets tickets, $1,994 on a Caribbean cruise, $224 on beach bars in Cozumel and Belize, and $769 in movie grill tabs. https://t.co/mKzvrNDZdH@HoustonRockets take notes https://t.co/be6L1MOPJbI love all Houston Rockets fans@caseyvitelli @HoustonRockets @Kevinporterjr @Nike @nikebasketball @Jumpman23 @unimockups @sportsTemplate Home uniform is great, the away uniform I’d prefer a white stripe on the side with the yellow only used as the piping. And I’ve never been a fan of yellow alternates. And the court looks pretty sweet. Just my opinions!My trade deadline predictions (not based on any sourced information) for the #Rockets:

1. Eric Gordon and Christian Wood stay put in Houston 

2. Two of Armoni Brooks, DJ Augustin, Daniel Theis and David Nwaba get traded or moved in some fashion@caseyvitelli @HoustonRockets @Kevinporterjr @Nike @nikebasketball @Jumpman23 @unimockups @sportsTemplate I like it but I don’t like the overuse of yellow in Rockets uniform concepts. Yellow was only used mostly as a small accent color on uniforms. They were mostly red and white. Too much yellow makes them look like McDonald’s.Absolutely the best I’ve seen… Please make this or something similar happen. The colors of CHAMPIONS.  @HoustonRockets @TilmanJFertitta https://t.co/2iDBpBrujPThe Houston Rockets Terik Black had 64 hotdogs in his pockets while playing.@caseyvitelli @HoustonRockets @Kevinporterjr @Nike @nikebasketball @Jumpman23 @unimockups @sportsTemplate welcome to mcdonald’s@ogseantyler @CornetaRockets @rohlo71 @caseyvitelli @HoustonRockets @Kevinporterjr @Nike @nikebasketball @Jumpman23 @unimockups @sportsTemplate Exactly my thinking. White is better but still boring. Black is okay because that's just the color Black in general. The throwbacks shouldn't even be throwbacks. We never should have taken those off. (Although I have a strange love for the pinstripes. Those city jerseys are fire)University of Houston finna lose to SMU tonight ... because they're playing defense like the Rockets!

SMU shooting 50% tonight.

Houston lead down from 15 to 6 now with 10 minutes left.
