https://t.co/KfqVJVD2PxIn the Atlanta Hawks game tonight, here's the props I really like:

- De'Andre Hunter over 13.5 points (-105)
- De'Andre Hunter over 1.5 3PM (+120)
- Trae Young over 39.5 Points, Reb, Assists (-105)

#PropDawg**Premium #4**      10-25-21

Pick: Atlanta Hawks -11.5 (-110) 5u

Hawks will want that bad taste out their mouth after that performance in Cleveland. I expect a full performance, 4 quarters  from ATL and cover this double digit spread.TIP: Atlanta Hawks - Detroit Pistons, S. Bey 15.5 Over , 1.87 by #tipster Eazy (profit this month: +124.32)
