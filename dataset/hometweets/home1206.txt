42 days later, they are the 6-seed, having gone 6-14, being outscored by almost 8 PPG.

They now are 10 games over .500, but have been outscored by opponents this year.Did you know California imposed a “Jock Tax” in 1991 after the Chicago Bulls beat the LA Lakers in the finals? 

The “Jock Tax” bill subjects highly paid athletes (and other taxpayers) to pay state income tax in the state the money was earned.

#Ghxsts https://t.co/fRaufMcK3K@TheVeganBoss @LukeAFoley The thing is before Jordan joined the Bulls the bulls were just there to make up the numbers. They were getting whipped up and basketball was falling down the pecking order in most watched sports in Chicago way below Football and Baseball. The guy came in and changed the game.🐐The Bulls had such a great start to the year. Then injuries and a slide. Now the 6th seed in the East and a slightly negative point differential. Right now Chicago, Cleveland and Charlotte are maybe the weakest playoff teams. Nets, Raptors, Hawks more dangerous imo@LisaA311 @chicagobulls @BarackObama @bullscommunity @ObamaFoundation @bennythebull @Southpaw No you don't! #blocked@chicagobulls @DCSoljaGurl @BarackObama @bullscommunity @ObamaFoundation @bennythebull @Southpaw Chicago Bulls ❤️ war criminals#NBAAllStar and Chicago Bulls star Demar Derozan is a huge fan of Nigerian dish - Egusi with Fufu.😏🇳🇬

Every team has injuries. Bulls are pathetic, and their fans that do this r too. Absolutely pathetic@ChicagoSports34 They gotta commit 100% to the rebuild and the tank and nothing else no fluke playoff runs
 every other team in Chicago is closer to a ring
Even the Bears got JF1 and a good front office 
White sox and bulls are playoff caliber teams
And cubbies are a dark horse wild card team@LBozoAmoungUs @chicagobulls Ppg? Robs defensive impact trumps Caruso EASILY. And Celtics r a much better team then they were.

Miami ends the season as the #1 seed while the Bulls are fighting to stay out of the play-in… 😂@appis_this @chicagobulls Rob averages 10 ppg and as a starting C that’s not great also I’m just speaking facts when they were healthy they were much better than the Celtics@bronhistory Dude nothing compared to Michael Jordan skills, nowadays the NBA has become way too sensible to technical fouls, Lebron wouldn’t survive Rodman defense Chicago bullsIt was busy 24 hours for former President Barack Obama in Chicago. Wednesday night, he delivered remarks at the University of Chicago and then attended a Bulls game. Thursday, Obama visited high school students at Hyde Park Academy. https://t.co/iIGlxRf6m9Only thing I gotta say about this is Chicago bulls MJ never missed the playoffs and honestly nobody was expecting him to do anything with the Wizards he just played to mentor Kwame https://t.co/alfWpQqUQh@BarackObama @chicagobulls @MBK_Alliance @girlsalliance @ObamaFoundation Did you, and/or @MichelleObama, make a trip down to Lincoln too? https://t.co/XLP9opr5FN @CP3 @carmeloanthony @DeMar_DeRozan @DRose @JoakimNoah @KevinGarnett5KG @Dame_Lillard  #ItsEnteringThe4thQuarter #TheyCouldUseAnAssist@TheMadBelmont I 💗 this bro you should do more 😊👍 by the way that #ChicagoBulls #Hat is 🔥The Bulls are in the playoffs!

Enjoy the cards!Beautiful now all we have to do is win our last game and we get the easiest matchup for the Eastern Conference in the Chicago Bulls. I wouldn't be surprised if we swept them, or atleast win in 5 games. #BullsNation #bleedgreen #FearTheDeer #NBAPlayoffs #NBA #Raptors #Celtics@ProCityHoops If you speak from solely stats it screams Chicago. But if you actually trust your eyes and see what the Bulls are missing, it’s any form of defense, especially interior paint defense which is something that Wendell provides (when healthy).@jackfrank_jjf @Dom_2k The new Chicago bullsIt was busy 24 hours for former President Barack Obama in Chicago.

Thursday, Obama visited high school students at Hyde Park Academy.  - @joesotoradio https://t.co/FufyYCpT8R@dumpsterfiremd @TVMoviefan30 @KyleNeubeck The bulls don't have a choice. Lavine chooses whether he wants to stay or leave since his contract expires in the summer. Bulls can't stop him. And Philly can choose not to give Harden a new deal so he'd be a free agent n then Chicago can get himSoooo do we want Toronto or Chicago?! bulls haven't beat a good team all year so I'm thinking themI just need bucks v nets 1st rd matchup. Wish Cavs were healthier &amp; didn’t end up in the play in. Celtics v Bulls would’ve been fire if Chicago was healthy… https://t.co/mMCqOMHan9@chicagobulls You guys need to stop dogging the Bulls.  They made the playoffs compared to the last several years. They're coming along. You should be sending positive vibes!!!Sadly true. Once I saw the standings again I was so disappointed to see Chicago slide. Technically still possible to get the Bulls but I have said I do not want to see Toronto https://t.co/BP1MfJDgEcIt was busy 24 hours for former President Barack Obama in Chicago.
