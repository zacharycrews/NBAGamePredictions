But these last 5-10 games, this team hasn’t looked even competitive. It would be cool for the fans to know if this is due to front office saying to Silas, make sure we don’t win games or?@HoustonRockets İf u take 3 steps, this is steps in Europe, but not in NBA, so I love NBAWaking up … and realizing …

The Houston #Rockets fanbase appreciates your franchises contribution to our cause 🤝I’m convinced the @HoustonRockets just give up in the 4th.Another loss for the #Nets.

Sigh: you really think they can pull this off? The Houston Rockets won the NBA Finals in 1995 as a sixth seed. To date, they remain the lowest seed to win the Finals.

True but...#Brooklyn has #KevinDurant.
