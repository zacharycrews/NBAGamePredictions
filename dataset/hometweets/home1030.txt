#DubNation https://t.co/XiXwBdLf7e@BallySportsSW @DallasStars Any idea as to why Stars games aren't showing up in the New Orleans markets anymore? Several games missed because beach volleyball replays from 2019 are on - and no, the Pelicans nor Mavericks weren't playing that night either.2)...After a brief surge, the Pelicans have returned to reality. There isn't enough firepower to keep pace with Phoenix. The Suns are coming off a beatdown of the Lakers. Lost to New Orleans three weeks ago. Off a rest day, it's a nice spot on a short line. The Suns should roll.Indiana Pacers - Memphis Grizzlies

When Phoenix is a 4-5 point favorite on road, they are 17-3 dating back to 2010. But, six of those games happened in 2021 or 2022. 

In those games, the #Suns are 5-1 SU but only 3-3 #ATS.

McCollum entered the NBA’s health and safety protocols last Thursday and missed New Orleans’ games against Charlotte on Friday and Houston on Sunday. https://t.co/as9gnYkVl4The Suns take on the Pelicans tonight in New Orleans and even without Chris Paul this Suns team has thrived due to contributions up and down the roster but especially from Devin Booker and Deandre Ayton.

Check out my analysis for @ActionNetworkHQ!
