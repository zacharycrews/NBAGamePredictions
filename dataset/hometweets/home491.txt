🧑‍💻 Hornets allow good centers to score A LOT.  Some recent games: Jokic/29, Gobbert/23, Ayton+McGuee/34, Embiid/43&amp;32pts.

Also, hardly a major feat being the best pro athlete in Charlotte history...not much to go off of, but plenty of Hornets better, cause Cam ain't getting into the HoF."I was very disappointed that there wasn’t an Eric Collins montage.... so I made one"

https://t.co/Au6YcIFVFf@WilliamIWells @Canes @hornets @Panthers I didn’t abandon any of them either, but at that time it felt like people were trying to make them better, in the current form the coaching staff in inept and everyone sees it.@hornets I'll be there 🔥 3rd game attended for me this season. Will be rocking my new LaMelo jersey 🔥During their long winning streak, Christian Wood led Houston to a key win over LaMelo Ball and the Hornets one month ago. But the Rockets (+6.5) are clear underdogs in a return visit to Charlotte.  https://t.co/IyAOPpKzl7Hornets take on the Rockets tonight - they won’t have any of Martin, Bridges, or Washington. 

Still, with Ball + Hayward + Rozier, Charlotte should be able to handle things.🔥Monday🔥

#sportsbetting #betting #sportspicks #gamblingtwitter #gamblingRevenge Game: D.J. Augustin plays Charlotte tonight.  He played 282 games in his career for the Hornets.Both times the #Hornets have had multiple players enter H&amp;S Protocols, it's followed their two biggest rest periods (4 days off) of the season. 

Just when you think Charlotte can rest and recover, they are stretched thin with players absent./r/CharlotteHornets: RTB MB - Intro (Official Music Video) #AllFly https://t.co/0BHw7BwD8F@bobpockrass @CBJspanberg I hate this. He was the first media person in Charlotte I ever met during the first two years of the Hornets.It's been too long — your Hornets are back at Spectrum Center (aka. the Hive) in the US city of Charlotte, as we tuned to @Sportsnet One for viewers in Ontario and Manitoba! 🙌

And from the looks of it, almost 2,000 ppl agreed with the tweet. See you in a few weeks :)@BelkForever @SportsCenter @hornets And yet I asked you what was poor about Kemba’s Game besides FG % and you can’t tell me one damn thing :) come back to this thread in a few weeks bruh@BigKnickVibez @SportsCenter @hornets I witnessed firsthand in Section 200 when yall came to Charlotte and lost this year too. But I dont watch ball, you right fam. You got it. #BingBong right?@BelkForever @SportsCenter @hornets Oh word and you want your opinion on the Knicks to matter? 😂 talking like Kemba didn’t turn the team around in a big way. Cause you’re not watching the games. We actually care about ball bro, we watch every game, we witnessed the change. Can’t be happy for another fan base SMFH@BigKnickVibez @SportsCenter Oh trust I’m sleeping good for now, my @Hornets in 7th placeI love nba Topshot.
