My second SGP is for the Pelicans v Spurs. Go look at JV‚Äôs history against San Antonio. CJ has been cruising to these numbers w/o BI in the lineup. 22 and 7 isn‚Äôt asking too much from Murray.

Final one tonight will be peoples choice!ü§ò https://t.co/U15kqQEmEvA quick trip to the Lone Star State! ü§†
