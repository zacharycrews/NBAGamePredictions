I just would like an explanation on why In your NBA power rankings the other day, the Chicago Bulls weren’t even in the top 10. You put 5 east teams ahead of the #1 seed Bulls.

Explain yourself.Never thought @chicagobulls hat 🧢 would somehow dramatically enter the Ukraine 🇺🇦 drama. But hey it’s 2022.

Many fans in NWI are tired of the same teams -- Nets, Lakers, Bucks, Sixers, Warriors -- in Saturday prime time. Got a damn good team here, the BULLS, maybe you heard of them. These aren't the Bears. How about some Chicago love? #NBAJa Morant isn’t listed on Grizzlies’ injury report this morning for their game against the Bulls tonight.

https://t.co/zkrv8gmbrc@ibuzzworth15 @chicagobulls Why? Are you a Chicago bulls fan??@Payt10 @chicagobulls Yeah, I know. But couldn't remember if we were at home or not.I’m done for this season. I was still hoping for the team to come back after the all star break and be focused but fk no. They suck. Let’s go Chicago Bulls!!@chicagobulls_12 @Virt7__ @LilJimmy_3 @AllenmvpJosh @JHarden13 y’all are a great squad. just saying demar is the reasoning for it@chicagobulls_12 @Virt7__ @LilJimmy_3 @AllenmvpJosh @JHarden13 also bulls are 7-5 without Lavine on the floor, and Caruso and Lonzo have missed majority of games this season. if you switch Lavine and Derozan and have Demar sit, guaranteed y’all might drop in seeding. Demar is that guy@chicagobulls_12 @Virt7__ @LilJimmy_3 @AllenmvpJosh @JHarden13 i never said Lavine wasn’t a good scorer, he’s been a dominant scorer for years now. what i’m saying is without derozan y’all wouldn’t be contenders. y’all had Lavine for years and he never lead to anything, Derozan has been carrying the bulls on his back.@TheHoopCentral I respectfully disagree with this assessment. DeRozan should be no.1. #DeRozan #ChicagoBullsWHY The Chicago Bulls Keep Getting DEADLIER… https://t.co/fPKbN2x9PK@chicagobulls @RealTristan13 KHLOE rn knowing he bout to go out an “Celebrate” later…😬😬😬😬🤣 https://t.co/SVlz5BwcQK@Marilyn22100648 @NBA @chicagobulls What’s your point in posting this@chicagobulls_12 @Virt7__ @LilJimmy_3 @AllenmvpJosh @JHarden13 Ain’t Embiid by himself outplay boffum when they matched up?Chicago bulls are the best team in NBA currently and everybody predicted Lakers.
