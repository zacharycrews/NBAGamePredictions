  Golden State is on a back to back, playing in Milwaukee on Thu, so it's possible Thompson won't play in one of those if he is back.I have a feeling @StephenCurry30 throws down 15 treys tonight... Keep the faith @warriors #DubNationthat @warriors bench rotation gonna be STOOPID with Klay getting back into form@NBlakiston @Roger_fan123 @MaxRigman @Jumpshot8 @NBA @Suns @warriors @Bulls @nets @Bucks And I'll admit myself, I don't think it's going to take only one Warrior to keep Ayton cold. It'll be a team effort of course.

But I could see the Warriors do well on him. Maybe not fully stop him, but at least have him force tough shots and lower his efficiency.@wojespn Dunno who the Golden warriors are but if they half as good as Golden State warriors we in for a show🙌🙌Ok, @warriors: just send everyone Back home after the ESPN game. https://t.co/e2pIHYIC8TSources tell me Golden State Warriors SG will make his debut this Sunday against the Cavaliers. (via @Jackclippers)@NBlakiston @Roger_fan123 @MaxRigman @Jumpshot8 @NBA @Suns @warriors @Bulls @nets @Bucks I wouldn't necessarily say only way, but yes that's one way.

Even at 70%, he's a difference maker. I think offensively he'll be fine, but endurance will be the test. Especially on D with that Achilles. Suns are a great team. I'm looking forward to them playing against each other more.After waiving guard Jeff Dowtin Jr., the Golden State Warriors opened a two-way roster spot.  https://t.co/MEVQfTKhDC@AliochaMatt @NBA @Suns @warriors @Bulls @nets @Bucks I am hoping Klay is back. Love him as a player and person.@mitchgobetz @AliochaMatt @NBA @Suns @warriors @Bulls @nets @Bucks He has not played in almost 3 years and was not expected to play until around now and unlike Warrior Fans. It’s gonna be hard for him to be the Klay we know maybe until playoffs.@warriors we need a montage of Klay's greatest highlights during player intros when he comes back, something like "after 950+ days Welcome Back.... {roll 📽+ him on his 🛥 😂} ...complete with pyrotechnics ....Klay and the fans deserve this and Chase will be lit.... do it! https://t.co/jtRba1UFOB@jzfish, @WarReportRadio and everyone else are here to discuss which cheat codes the @warriors put into their game genie... https://t.co/zlTvuFa8EM@OurChildRights @ATLHawks @celtics @OrlandoMagic @chicagobulls @nyknicks @Lakers @MiamiHEAT @warriors @memgrizz @dallasmavs Your wording, “Child custody battles”, pretty much precludes mediation.

He's missed the whole season.@Jumpshot8 @NBA @Suns @warriors @Bulls @nets @Bucks The Defending Champions have improved from last season.  The depth they have at the guard spots will allow them to shut down any team for key stretches of games.@Jumpshot8 @NBA @Suns @warriors @Bulls @nets @Bucks Eddie Klay will make this comparison unfair. Just watch, Warriors will be dominant with Klay back in the lineup.@Jumpshot8 @NBA @Suns @warriors @Bulls @nets @Bucks Overrating the Bulls a little but it's all good.  Don't sleep on Cleveland.

After a two-game absence due to health and safety protocols, Draymond Green returns to the lineup for Golden State@NBATV @MiamiHEAT @warriors Letsss go @MiamiHEAT@warriors @TISSOT Welp, I guess Wilt didn't exist then and didn't have like 30 of these games 🤣@warriors Today is the first day of the year we get to watch @Money23Green play.@th3_prophet @BIG_Brandon_BCG @DubWayne12 @Legodrules @ProvideContext @Rjeff24 Doesn’t matter. From golden state fans arguments it changes momentum and everything.. 

Bron dropped 41 the game draymond missed.. then he dropped 41 the game draymond played. He had game 6 and 7 back and the warriors couldn’t win one game. 
People need to stop cryingBy overhauling what he eats, Golden State Warriors center Kevon Looney has resuscitated his career and re-established himself as a key member of a title contender.
https://t.co/3V8NwpnD2S@DubNationBabyy @Jwendling6 @TAYON2K @Aussieboi_04 @statmuse @KlayThompson @warriors @WarriorsPR Also GS has play 19 home games in the first 35 games. That may not seem significant but it is like a 4-6 game difference and at least a 2-3 game win advantage for them over the league average. And Denver has played 20 games on the road out of 34 games. That’s a 5-6 win swing.@DubNationBabyy @Jwendling6 @TAYON2K @Aussieboi_04 @statmuse @KlayThompson @warriors @WarriorsPR I don’t think the Jazz are better than GS. I say the same thing about the Jazz. Their roster has been basically untouched by COVID. That will change soon. But their record is inflated by playing against teams with that advantage. But unfortunately their remaining schedule is easy#MIAvsGSW

We saw it right out in front with Kuminga, Wiggs on Saturday missing 4pt play and others. Must fix before playoffs or it will cost us games and series.@SurtainSzn @jv20zika @statmuse @KlayThompson @warriors @WarriorsPR That doesn't matter tho? It's all about probability. Nuggets scoring 29 points in a half or Jokic having that many turnovers is about as likely as Warriors missing that many free throws, regardless of the opponent's defense@warriors @TISSOT Life long Warriors fan with a fun/not so fun fact that Kerr needs to fix ASAP. Only 5 Warriors are currently shooting above 69% of free throws. So besides Steph and Poole and Porter everyone else can be fouled and most times only make 1 FT if that. Wrap your head around that.@warriors @TISSOT he about to drop 65 today !!Dallas Mavericks - Denver Nuggets

You can too! https://t.co/xwydQmZfqj@osteomath @marshallboomer @dagatorlady @warriors Nobody rotates fast enough when Gobert plays perimeter defense. When he rushed out to take on Curry Looney got an easy dunk. That's why he is so cautious at going out to the perimeter. Also Mitchell Mitchell hurt his ankle in the 1st qtr, you can't blame that on Quin.National TV @warriors vs @cavs January 9 please!!!!!

Its pretty much just Jamal. Warriors betterEveryday I am reminded how much the Steelers pain me and then everytime I remind myself I’m a Golden State Warriors fan, and then it feels a little bit better. Best team in the league. #DubNation@DubNationBabyy @Jwendling6 @TAYON2K @Aussieboi_04 @statmuse @KlayThompson @warriors @WarriorsPR It probably won’t happen. Warriors have one of the toughest remaining schedules. And Denver has the easiest remaining schedule. Denver will secure the 4 seed and GS will drop to the 3. I don’t see GS getting past PHX in the 2nd round. Y’all better hope Utah gets the 2 seed.@DubNationBabyy @Jwendling6 @TAYON2K @Aussieboi_04 @statmuse @KlayThompson @warriors @WarriorsPR Okay, Jamal is basically the heart of the Denver pick and roll. They’ve been piecing it together for a year now but it is lethal with him. MPJ adds much needed spacing as he was the most efficient 20 pt scorer last year since Wilt. We can keep doing this all day.

Klay creates really good spacing and gets some open threes for the team. Also another 17-21 ppg scorer. Oh yeah and Wiseman is out too. I think the Warriors are better.@UncleDaddy86 @jr_heeen @TAYON2K @Aussieboi_04 @statmuse @KlayThompson @warriors @WarriorsPR He hasn’t done it without KD since 2015-16 season. And hasn’t made the playoffs since 2019.@DubNationBabyy @Jwendling6 @TAYON2K @Aussieboi_04 @statmuse @KlayThompson @warriors @WarriorsPR Klay averaged 21/4/2 in his last season. Jamal averaged 21/4/5. Warriors were missing Draymond. Denver was missing Aaron Gordon and MPJ. I would argue the two of them combined are more important than Draymond. But at the very least their value is equal. Healthy Denver is better.@DDDGURU @SteinmetzNBA @SteinyGuru957 @49ers @warriors @957thegame I already know Guru gonna be souped up tomorrow@warriors Yeah but what gets me more is how happy Andrew seems with the Warriors...dude is always laughing and that was somewhat a rarity before...
