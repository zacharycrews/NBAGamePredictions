Don't trust the 76ers on the road really against anyone. They are night and day compared to how they play at home.

Don't suppose these people could be convinced to come ruin the Washington Wizards real quick?@moon4moon3moon2 but the hield trade was rumored way more than the russ one, meaning Washington knew if they dont do a trade, the lakers could’ve pivoted. 

the wizards had no pivot and we still gave in to them. Morey point is a good one.The Washington Wizards https://t.co/IiMs41zMO3@PrinceLaney Bro. I know what Russells deficiencies are. I also know that Washington wizards roster last year had NO BUSINESS being in the playoffs. They signed a solid point guard and got 3 players for Russ to balance out the ROSTER. You really disappointing me ignoring the obvious.@SpencerClassic @JSmooth Deff bad trade but westbrook was performing in Washington what are you talking bout bruh ? Avg 23 12 n 12 while shooting 43% from the field n help the wizards make playoffsHere's where Russell Westbrook's teams finished offensively each season since 2019:

2019 OKC Thunder: 16th
2020 Houston Rockets: 6th
2021 Washington Wizards: 17th
2022 Los Angeles Lakers: 27th*The #NBA75 trade of the decade so far:  Washington trades Russell Westbrook and a second round pick to the Lakers for Kuzma, Harrell, Caldwell Pope and a 1st round pick.
