I was talking about what makes Hayward the better player at the moment, and that would be his previous experience over more years with different teammates against more players, in tougher games.

So yes, judging what he brings to the team NOW is INFORMED by his other years@ChristoFlash92 @Brooks20Alonzo @Sorrowinfinity @DKM_Sports @SamFarberLive @MELOD1P @hornets Last 2 years would be considering BOTH years and that means he's correct, which is probably why he didn't say just this year.

Lamelo is having a better year, but better year doesn't mean better player team-wise. Ie Westbrook stats are always good, not always good for the teamThe Raptors are back in action! They're on the road to visit the Charlotte Hornets. What's the play?

I'm not going along with this BS from the NBA that tries to pretend the Hornets disappeared for two years and came back with a new nickname while another team played with their name.

Wow https://t.co/RXqwV4L6JY@Zsaheem856 @DMGrubb Though technically the Hornet's team history and records from the 80s to 2002 are a part of the team in Charlotte today and NOLA's team records start in 2002. It's weird lol@Zsaheem856 @DMGrubb Nah bro, the team that's in NOLA used to the original Charlotte Hornets from the 80s that moved to NOLA on 2002. Then in 2004 the NBA created the Charlotte Bobcats who changed their name to the Hornets after NOLA changed to the Pels in 2014.@AVKingJames @warneagle Fair
Although now I‚Äôm thinking about how the current hornets look would be but with Charlotte across the front instead of hornets@STAAtalent @hornets The Hornets are privileged to have 2 outstanding pbp announcers doing TV and radio. Good guys both when I have worked with them in SoCal.@Zsaheem856 @Jer_de_Bear @DMGrubb Uh yeah you wrong‚Ä¶Benson bought the Hornets and changed the name to Pelicans. Charlotte then got the Hornets name back and changed the Bobcats back to Hornets. Team never left. Good try tho@Jer_de_Bear @DMGrubb They got Disneyland. Lol. And what u mean who else left. The hornets is in Charlotte ain‚Äôt they? Correct me if I‚Äôm wrong. Before the pels came y‚Äôall didn‚Äôt have no team for a year? But bro. Orlando should probably move too. But they don‚Äôt have Zion. So who cares.

And, it's not the first time it's happened. 

MJ was supposed to be Mitchell's boss with the Charlotte Hornets.

He told the story here.
