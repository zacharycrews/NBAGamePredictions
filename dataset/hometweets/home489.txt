It's not about Zo not hitting layups. Demar listed as a guard  ensures he starts. If they put him at forward, Durant and Giannis will win the forward category with Embid at Center. In adding Demar, he will start.#NORARS using the 90s Chicago Bulls intro song 😌Tottenham 3rd shirt and a Chicago bulls hat. Is you shitten me?!@TheSASBurner @chicagobulls @SamSmithHoops Why? Because it's the only way to get Demar as a starter. If they put Demar at forward, he will not get as many voters as Durant and Giannis. He will be a 2nd unit and he definitely deserves to start. So I think this is a good move to put Demar as a guard.@ChiSportsGuy @okccfacfp @chicagobulls Oh jit clappin sumMerry Christmas #chicago bulls and families https://t.co/4Xn24p0Tao@WCIA3Jennifer @chicagobulls AWESOME!

No @chicagobulls on Xmas day doesn’t feel like Xmas. You’ve effectively ruined the day for me. 

                                                    Signed, me@DQuinn1575 👍🏽💪🏾That’s crazy bro—I remember thick-ass coupon books from the 80s.  

I moved to Chicago for a few years in the mid-90s — when the MJ-led Bulls were starting their 2nd three-peat — so I can’t imagine what it was like be able to get Bulls tickets from those coupon books. 😂😂
