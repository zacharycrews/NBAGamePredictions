If Golden State Warriors beat the Dallas Mavericks in Game 5, than Golden State Warriors will face Miami Heat or Boston Celtics.Warriors will defeat Mavericks which is why am rooting for Celtics to beat Miami. Boston only team capable of beating Golden State in the Finals. Anyone but GSW #DALvsGSWChuck been wrong all year 😂😂😂

Y’all can’t be that blind nor incompetent. @NBA @warriors@Tim_Charles01 @PiperPerabo @warriors @GOP I'll admit. The knife stabbing on the train was impressive. But it's not the norm. It's an anomaly. Two dead here, four dead there... it's sad. But it's not proof that a knife can do as much damage as an AR-15. If it were, why all the fuss? Buy a knife.Go @warriors!

So most of the counted deaths aren’t even knife attacks. And those that are rarely end up in the victim dying. No matter what you say, they aren’t comparable. Your country is fucked.@MatthewBusta @Yankees Boomer chiming in. Good for the Yankees. Good for Steve Kerr and the Golden State Warriors in using their platform to share their disgust with the lack of action by the (R) Senators.

There is room for improvement without giving up our freedoms. Let's find some common sense laws we can follow, including mental health checks as a gun buyer.@Chiefs534891322 @warriors hardening of soft targets like schools is the best immediate solution. there are simply too many guns in circulation already. you would never be able to get rid of them all - even if most law-abiding gun owners cooperated, many would not. it would cause an armed revolt.Once again, @nba @warriors @SteveKerr’s lack of coaching experience shines bright in Game4, frustrating true basketball fans.

How many of the recent major shooting tragedies would have been stopped by background checks on a private sale?

Also, a mental person just walk in a mental institution for assistance. oh by the not only u r asking the person 2 go 4 therapy but pay for it as well. Wow never thought you were that smart. 👏@CubeTester0015 @gunpolicy @warriors Self defense is a human right.

Do you think Dallas can pull out the upset, or does Golden State punch their ticket to the 2022 NBA Finals?! @NBA @nbatopshot@HrenJohensu @TonzerWee @warriors So the guns may have been more about wanting the right to continue our own oppressive tendencies than to shake off real and perceived oppressions by the British.

Legally purchasing high capacity rifles does.@HrenJohensu @TonzerWee @warriors There’s a really interesting argument being made by historians that America revolted against England primarily to hold onto their “right” to enslave humans.

How many mass shooting have you seen in the uk? It’s just wrong on all levels.@TonzerWee @warriors Self defense is a part of it and everyone should have the means to defend themselves but the key point is the strength in numbers. With millions of gun owners the US government has a militia at all times ready to defend the core values of the nation. Those values being the…@TonzerWee @warriors It's called the 2nd amendment to the bill of rights.  the purpose is to allow the citizenry to protect itself in circumstances of gov't overreach and authoritarian control. you know, sort of like when we kicked your authoritarian and overreaching asses in the American revolution?@warriors Stop your team from playing until there is meaningful action. Too many tears and moments of silence to actually mean anything@warriors Hey coach. Where is you anger at the 50 senators who refused to discuss red flag laws and mental health issues just today.

From Italy🇮🇹@warriors Hopefully@ExecuteOrder623 @HallSimpleton Golden State Warriors are up 3-1 vs the Mavericks in the playoffs bc of the zone. Secondly zone was illegal when Jordan got into the league and it was slowly phased in, in other words he played against a soft zone.

That’s not by definition a good society.
I guess we will never agree, but you just have consider the harsh truth that the US isn’t as civilised of a country compared to countries of “same” standard.Bad beats in NBA lately, missed everything last two days. Just one play for today.

They only want control and power@JonnoVanguard Aye Golden State Warriors for NBA champions 👀Although the Warriors are one win away from returning to the NBA Finals, it's hard not to look ahead when they've had so many guys step up. This summer, it's Golden State's iron man that will have decisions to make with how good he's been recently ⬇️⬇️

https://t.co/VUc5tcvlFg@JoaoSSJRose @warriors Hey João Pereira, I think Luka will kick Curry ass tonight. Hope u don't cry@John77smith1 @Dark_NYT_85 @warriors How? By raising the age from 18 to 21?  There was NO evidence, at this time, that this kid was a danger.

Again, you can't litigate evil.This isn’t the same Golden State team that once ran the NBA, but these playoffs have proven that Steph, Draymond and the Warriors are still a force.

At least now criminals might pause thinking it’s possible they can be stopped@warriors @NBAonTNT @957thegame @ESPNRadio @Oracle Finish this please@derek_fadda @warriors I know though that guns are dangerous, but don’t take them away from those who use them properly and lawfully.

We’re invading ourselves!!@spatty84 @Chiefs534891322 @warriors Saw someone suggest that “fun” guns and ammo (eg: stuff that’s more about the “fun” of shooting than protection or hunting, like AR15) should have to be kept at a shooting range—after all, it’s the only place you should be using them.@warriors Please win 😭@warriors play today! This a Big Moment for the city. Entertainment impacts a city’s infrastructure tremendously. Music, acting, sports coincide with each other and it’s dope to see one of the best teams in the history of basketball be in my city.

And if there has been any, I assure you that’s not something usual: no need of specific protocols in schools or political intervention. No tons of children dying every year because of it.@warriors we need a dub from #DubNation tonight@warriors Thank you for speaking the truth! Something needs to change!@DonInCincinnati @MrLouie_ @biggestbison1 @HandyK17 @warriors He contrasted the federal government of the United States to the European kingdoms, which he described as "afraid to trust the people with arms", and assured that "the existence of subordinate governments ... forms a barrier against the enterprises of ambition".Ok @warriors let's close it out tonight so you guys can be rested (and healthy) for the finals next week 🙏🙏🙏@DonInCincinnati @MrLouie_ @biggestbison1 @HandyK17 @warriors He argued that state militias "would be able to repel the danger" of a federal army, "It may well be doubted, whether a militia thus circumstanced could ever be conquered by such a proportion of regular troops."@JulsMilesBrown @50_yow @AliAdair22 @warriors No.

No “honoring” victims with a convenient time set aside, a moment of silence, a single weekend the oligarchs can plan around. That just gives them a new way to play lip service.

If teams just STOP…that’s money. And angry constituents.@Free2thinkto @ADonehue @TonzerWee @warriors You have one of if not the largest military in the world and you honestly think you need people running around with guns pretending to be partisans to protect your country. You and your country are in more trouble than I thought.@MatHeywood @kooi1970 @Prince15081967 @warriors What diff does that make? Europe is home to the worst mass school shooting in history. Your argument is FALSE! 

Point of FACT Cain killed Able with a Rock. God didn't ban all rocks. He blamed Cain, held him responsible for his sin. The world has a sin problem not a gun problem.@DonInCincinnati @MrLouie_ @biggestbison1 @HandyK17 @warriors Cool story, however I'll take the word of one of the authors of the document over some random internet guy. 
Madison wrote how a federal army could be kept in check by state militias, "a standing army ... would be opposed [by] a militia."@warriors Powerful plain speaking.  Thank you.@derek_fadda @warriors Trust me, they are not, if they didn’t have guns they would still find their way into being psychos. Guns are not the root cause of this ongoing problem, those kids are. Take guns away from them that they would find other ways, trust me. The problem would still be there..@warriors head coach @SteveKerr asked when our leaders were going to "do something" about #GunSafetyNow. One easy step would be for Christian leaders to stop blessing the efforts of the @NRA. #NBA #NBAPlayoffs #NBAConferenceFinals 
https://t.co/ldnZq5tACZ@DickieV @NBA @dallasmavs @warriors Coaching is suspect as well.@BentsonChris @JulsMilesBrown @50_yow @AliAdair22 @warriors Your history is backwards. They turned in their guns and now they don’t have mass shootings on the regular.

But you knew that didn’t youIt's gonna be the @celtics and @warriors in the Finals because they play the best brand of #team basketball. Hats off to the @MiamiHEAT as they certainly play a solid team game as well. But the Celtics players, coaches on up to the GM have perfected the team concept.Check out 1990 SkyBox NBA Golden State Warriors Steve Johnson Trading Card #DubNation https://t.co/Ez1YFJji9N #eBay via @eBay #NBA75 #NBATwitterLive #NBATwitter #NBA #NBAPlayoffs #NBAonTNT #NBAFinals@Free2thinkto @ADonehue @TonzerWee @warriors Yeah which was written hundreds of years ago and was written with the British government in mind.

Good luck with that@warriors I.M.O. -Texas is the most terrible state in America 
- if the governor does not allow abortions in state, but at the same time he allows the killing of children?? in the state because the police do nothing to protect kids in school??@The_Araon @Xaphyr1 @Benjami64597721 @warriors As well they should. It is an active shooter situation and an active crimes scene."The former NBA player and current Golden State Warriors head coach was born in Beirut, and has been personally affected by gun violence. His father, Malcolm Kerr, was shot dead by militants in Lebanon." https://t.co/KiQAGc6F5q@kpu6600 @BrassWing13 @sophiefotini @nyja9 @warriors It sounds to me like you need to talk to a psychologist.Crazy idea, but stay with me:

We started a petition asking @SteveKerr  the @warriors  &amp; ALL professional athletes to use THEIR power, pause playing until congress takes action and passes a bill to require mandatory background checks for gun purchases.
https://t.co/axegR7DeSw@GMCoz @peter_rabbit35 @business @warriors @Quicktake I don’t totally disagree, but in order to effectively tackle all those factors to prevent mass shooting, gun restriction is something that is necessary. Even if we start mental health programs, there are problems with affordability and accessibility in terms of services (1).@andysmi45016210 @sdcrypto76 @rpetty @warriors For starters. How the hell does someone freely walk into a school? Why do we value our safety at sporting events, movie theaters and airports more than the children?

Daniels has over 30 years of experience in professional sports and live entertainment. Her vision, leadership and perspectives will elevate the Chase Center experience for everyone visiting the venue.@AbsolutPatrick @JGoddeau @thatbabeape @warriors I should start googling pencil murders while you have a device and internet for crazy third world crimes with not much documentation—if any—made online, but those from the third world? While you sit in the first world, giving commands.@warriors Your tweet was quoted in an article by nytimes https://t.co/48FmBTXbB1@warriors @BarackObama My idea: AR15s and Automatic weapons of war (&amp; high capacity magazines) could still be legal, but only at licensed gun ranges / shooting ranges, and not in hands of individuals. 

Fair compromise? So “hobbyists” &amp; “gun enthusiasts” can still shoot them but safely.

How many people know the "who and how" of illegally buying 2 AR15s and a shitload of ammo off the street?  WAY less than the # who know how to find a gun shop.@Keyester123 @JoeHardwick67 @FlorenceChild1 @trifecta_of_luv @largenotmassive @rpetty @warriors Because the second amendment allows all law abiding citizens the right to bear arms. Really as simple as that. Ever heard of the civil war?@warriors Yes enough. We have enough guns and bullets. Now we need a couple of rules, not about ownership, about public safety. We could start with universal background checks.The Dallas Mavericks will head back to California Thursday for Game 5 of the Western Conference Finals against the Golden State Warriors.

So, congratulations to the Golden State Warriors on clinching the Western Conference finals later this evening.@CryptoD49710537 @BoBrown1313 @heatherjcla @rpetty @warriors they'd be right 👍👍 it does include taking guns away, not saying all guns - just from those that aren't fit to use them (which is a lot). 
not directed at u, but I don't care if they get "triggered", getting upset bc some1 is taking a lethal weapon away from u isn't a good thing@Tehlem @DrummerDad1064 @pallep7 @warriors There seems to be some debate as to whether Pakistan was invaded or just the people within attacked by American and Coalition forces…

But that’s a discussion about complicity@warriors Thank you, Steve! 🙏@NBA @dallasmavs @warriors The mavericks haven't been the same since Steph Curry enden them@warriors Pleasee win today lets goo@NBA @dallasmavs @warriors Two baby faced assasins@warriors What a hero@warriors Just finish it, get it done frauds.@warriors GUNS &amp; GUNS is all peeps #bitch about and no mention that May is Mental Health Awareness month and the perps from the past two incidents both had known issues…butt⬅️ forget all that it’s almost June when it’s the fact LGBT Pride month will be jammed up your ass daily! 🍆🍑🤛@warriors do y’all wanna go to the finals or notLike I Said…. @warriors vs @celtics

Nobody is saying we end dying or even stop mass shootings. We are talking about reducing mass shootings. Do some homework; they are on the rise. 

Gun deaths went down, under Obama.

We all need to DO something about this mess. Condolences and prayers are correct to offer to the families, but we owe the children to act and speak for them. END gun violence NOW, make them enact laws that STOP this violence 😢@warriors W DAY@damonheller @warriors Police and armed swat teams were at that school. Didn't save 19 kids. Armed police was on site in Florida. So having police on campus doesn't solved the problem.@smiles2322 @GBond187 @warriors Gun laws are not regulating guns but who can access them. It won’t  affect most gun owners. I’m just wondering, what disturbs you so much about gun laws for people deemed unfit to own guns that we can’t do one small thing to stop innocent people from getting killed so flippantly?@warriors You sir are a brainwashed minion and need take a reality pill !!  Guns don't kill !! It's  the people who use them do !!

Instead of having all mass shootings all across the year, it just designated to one day and people who participate are put on a watchlist since y'all don't want to have gun control laws.@nanetteb44 @LePapillonBlu2 @warriors @LeaderMcConnell @POTUS 
DON'T get fixated on the second amendment like it's the holy grail of the constitution.

Stop telling us what can’t be done and do what CAN be done.@warriors "A well regulated militia" needs to be, well, regulated. The Swiss have managed it, so that trained soldiers (i.e. people who can usefully use their weapon to protect the security of a free state) keep their weapon at home.

They have more power than anyone really because there is SO much money.@warriors First of all absolutely right, do something about it, ban all guns in the hands of citizens or regulate them in such a way that they become impossible to buy. And then also look at yourselves Americans. In other countries with similar laws there are no shootings like these.@weblevi @WwHeartbeatwW @KreutznaerRob @warriors Ok, so how do you explain that this only happens in the US?

The liberal policy of putting our children in a “gun free zone” is the worst decision possible.@rpetty @warriors Evidently politicians are unprepared to make policy as well.

That seems to be the key!!@warriors Impressive.
I live in the Netherlands. Fortunately we don't have armed security at schools of malls, and parents don't have to be affraid their child does not survive its day at school.
Why? Simple: Because it is not possible to legally buy a firearm without a psychological test.@warriors So when firearms are outlawed, and knives or hammers start being used, are we to ban those next? 

The problem is not the firearm. The problem is the person. Address the underlying mental health issues and you will see the shootings drop.@warriors Do the Uighur genocide next.@BCMaximalist @antwright6682 @Turnip_Of_Doom @BebbLawrence @warriors https://t.co/xSy7xY2fq5

#NBAonTNT #NBAPlayoffs@warriors All passion. Zero rational thinking. Although his intentions seem to be good, I would like to hear much more educated and reasoned thoughts from a person that can use this microphone... and of course, couldn't stay away from politics...@passdapercs @OregonHG @kevmarsden2 @eddie_skezzz @warriors My point is simple. We have crime, we even have gun crime (criminals find a way). Having guns as easily accessible as buying a pint of milk is a huge factor. Surely you Americans can measure your di**s in other ways than ‘who has the biggest assault rifle?’@warriors Well said. 👏@Chiefs534891322 @warriors Just stop selling fucking rifles as they were candy? And to 18 year olds who is clearly sick and damaged in their head. Just please do something USA.!@warriors So necessary to say: ENOUGH NOW!@warriors Steven Kerr, way to use your platform to stand up against gun violence. Keep fighting the fight for gun control and to protect our babies. These politicians sitting and protecting their positions do not give a crap about our children. Stop the prayers. Act now!@warriors Thank You for using your platform. Things need to change@warriors Steve Kerr is a wish washy liberal.

https://t.co/J5TGYbwZxW@warriors Steve Kerr is an amazing guy. USA needs more people like him. These mass shootings are insane, it's unbelievable that the most powerful country in the world is unable to do anything about it. Seems like it's falling victim to its own power. Praise Kerr, listen to him. Get mad.@ManifoldMaster @rpetty @warriors David Bonola from Queens , NY stabbed a women he met in a bar over 60 times and stuffed her body into a duffel bag and left her under a bridge . Should we ask the government to go into everyone’s home and remove their Steak Knives ?@GBond187 @warriors Mental issues are not matter that because although we have tons of in Japan, we never have such a terrible gun   murder case.@Matt_W1985 @ADonehue @TonzerWee @warriors There are countries plotting how to topple the U.S. every day you silly 🤡@WrestleLoomis @SherryPluskota @warriors Does the fact you need armed police in schools in the first place not ring any kind of alarm bells that something isnt quite right??@Jeannine8Carol @warriors These 50 Republicans keep stealing their seats,jobs, your power and better life opportunities.

If those police didn’t make it their,  who knows what that maniac would have done!!!@warriors A good start in the USA would be to prohibit the sale of guns, revolvers and weapons in general to individuals.

It isn’t and shouldn’t be a right to own a gun, it’s a privilege.@warriors Yes yes yesWe were spot on picking the Under in the Celtics win last night…that’s a three bet win streak for us in the NBA.

Sorry @dallasmavs fans but we like the Warriors to end the series tonight.

1) has @jaytatum0 elevated himself to a top 5 player?

2) I am not saying that @StephenCurry30 is a better player than Durant. He’s obviously not. But if @warriors reach the finals, shouldn’t curry be ranked higher on any all time list?@warriors @angiesliverpool BRAVO! STEVE KERR!!!@warriors my idolShare the #Best #sports content

Just read about the situation before commenting all this information is out there.@MikeDohmen @JamesZaky @Prince15081967 @warriors (not really feasible in the us) or trust the gun control laws will better help who can get access. Sadly though there's multiple problems here, the gun wasn't at fault, the crazy fuck who carried out the idea was. So what's the true problem still?Reviewed those individual matchups of @celtics x @warriors for the potential @NBA Final,

I like the Dubs chances in most of the possessions 

Warriors in 6@lvstckcmplcncy @k4grenac @ThaGreenGiant @RTomasi7 @rpetty @warriors You literally live in fear of life with some stricter restrictions on guns

You’d rather max gun laws and dead kids in schools then a whiff of tighter gun control@Quicktake @warriors Let’s also have border control let’s see what Nationality he is@Gindy @DarinCampbell20 @BrainiacBball @ShadrockQSC @JohnEngelbert_ @warriors Sad too see USA leads😭😭@warriors @POTUS your people are hurting, your people are scared, your people are angry and you choose to not do anything. #Disgraceful@fastchase23405 @shossy2 @warriors They do not have the power!@warriors This is what character looks like@GXLDDIGGER1 @Zokq_ @yamauli @AJNIntel @warriors What?

It's honestly kinda sad.@ADonehue @TonzerWee @JoelBrock25 @warriors You can use grenades and other explosives in the military but aren’t allowed to own any, and also there’s a difference between just owning a firearm and owning an AR@lvstckcmplcncy @k4grenac @ThaGreenGiant @RTomasi7 @rpetty @warriors Clearly those restrictions aren’t enough are they

You are literally the ONLY country in the world with consult near monthly school shootings

You’re telling me that isn’t a problem that some stricter gun control can solve@MoMoneyx9 @CleoGoodlin @kooi1970 @Prince15081967 @warriors When I said “it happens” I should have been clearer to say “children being murdered in school by gunmen happens”. Large parts of Latin America have gun death issues which are largely gang / drug related. The US has a mass shooter/gun suicide problem the rest of the world doesn’t.@ThomDevine @warriors This is satire, right?@MikeDohmen @JamesZaky @Prince15081967 @warriors Tighten down our gun laws to restrict access of guns being attained, force classes to own firearms especially with younger kids. Hell raise the age limit to buy if people agree that can help. Unfortunately I believe there's no true fix, you either get rid of all guns entirely.@Nbailey63942641 @mrdailylocks @warriors All over the world is not fantasy land@espn @warriors God bless you coach. 🙏🏼@SWinstonWolkoff @warriors @MichaelCohen212 .... well put MyLady .

The question should be whether that concept is even tenable in modern times.@Nbailey63942641 @mrdailylocks @warriors Like i said Americans are nuts and have it backwards on this topic@espn @warriors Speak the truth!@eddie_skezzz @warriors Only in the States &amp; 3rd world dictatorships...Bro Bro Bro , Stop.

Win tomorrow and book that ticket to the big dance a.k.a. The Finals @warriors@TheCastro @GXLDDIGGER1 @yamauli @AJNIntel @warriors Then what's your point? It doesn't change the fact there's been over 200 shootings mass or not on school grounds.

If you want just mass shootings I believe the usa is still in the lead with around 140 mass shootings this year so far.@warriors Steve Kerr in his feelings right now. You should never make decisions when you’re in your feelings. 😪@luvman33wife @warriors We have learned that initial media reports were incorrect, so I stand by my statement that schools need armed guards INSIDE! Schools are the most vulnerable, &amp; everyone knows that. Give the schools protection for our precious children!“When are we going to do something?”

@warriors coach Steve Kerr gave his best pregame speech ever Tuesday night.

He’s pleading for better gun control, and he’s talking to you.

Weird coincidence@LinkLunar @sdcrypto76 @rpetty @warriors Source?.@warriors pls be serious tomorrow@warriors Thank you Steve Kerr.

Arguing about guns is not helping them@Pintail_7 @Kris_Ruppel @Tiger4life78 @Dz1005 @warriors No the idea of red flag laws is what stupid and nothing you’ve suggested would’ve made any difference with what happened in Texas so educate yourself please. Red flag laws are something invented straight out of red china and are the antithesis of the foundation of ourconstitution@warriors Spot in Steve. This should not happen. All these lives lost due to politicians, bribes overshadowed as party donations.
The NRA should be held accountable along with any politicians against gun laws.@wyoung0125 @warriors He’s not contradicting himself; I think his position is to ban guns altogether.@warriors By the way, why are we asking Kerr about his opinions?@warriors Australia outlaws automatic weapons and not one massacre has occurred since when will Americans understand that there laws are old and there is no need for automatic weapons in the country. if it doesn’t change and the innocent die for the constitution then what is it’s worth@ChezK2021 @GaryLazer_Eyes @AJNIntel @warriors oh so capitalism is the answer yea? ahahahahahahahaha@osmelvergara @warriors I wouldn’t be surprised if we win 2 in a row bro@GCmG70Ef7CH8zQN @Hughblacawk @sophiefotini @nyja9 @warriors rage@warriors Amen!!

Do more defense, he being fouled out won’t hurt the GS team that bad, being scored on is. You’re not Steph yet, act accordingly. I knew GS would lose Game 4 when I saw JP was passively guarding Bronson.@warriors Warriors gonna win it!! Knew it from when the started the season undefeated! 😮‍💨This is coming from a Celtics fan! Hoping to see them in the finals 💚💚@AlpineCoxy @TonzerWee @warriors 20 people in seconds? Well hate to tell you this but with that logic so can every other semi auto weapon. It operates the same as a Glock pistol or a semi auto 12 gauge shotgun. It looks scary and society has made it the gun of choice for these mentally ill evil people.@starryflo @celtics @warriors Yup! I really feel this GS is gonna take it all in 6#GoldenStateWarriors better be ready 😤🔒 https://t.co/PnvNAvCg04@ADonehue @TonzerWee @warriors Let’s see them push 30,000 troops and a bunch of tanks across that border.

You were the voice of so many of us...thank you for using your platform to have our thoughts, anger, and passion be heard!@GiannisMeat @kevmarsden2 @eddie_skezzz @warriors Lol the 2nd amendment protects all the other rights.

All this political garbage that happens every time there is a school shooting is disgusting.@MikePElston @cFidd @DanSlott It's for the Golden State Warriors, they are super easy to find right now and will probably say "Curry" on them.

They either buy them legally because we don’t have enough barriers in our system or they have someone else buy them.@PaulJS2017 @coryell_jack @TonzerWee @warriors There’s a “black market” for everything that’s illegal.

there's a chance @Warriors can clinch WCF tomorrow &amp; @celtics can clinch ECF Fri 5/27 which means #NBA fans would go 5 LONG days w/out #NBAPlayoffs basketball😢

Here's to hoping @dallasmavs &amp; @MiamiHEAT push their series to 7 games🤞🤞@eddie_skezzz @warriors How did the armed guards fare against the Uvalde shooter?@ManifoldMaster @rpetty @warriors You do realize that 90% of murders committed in this country are carried out with handguns . Do you realize that in Chicago alone almost every weekend 10-20 people are shot - 5 or 6 killed yet they do nothing to stop it. It’s not the Gun,it’s the person pulling the triggerDoes @warriors coach Steve Kerr know that FBI background checks are already required to purchase a firearm in the United States?Check out this listing I just added to my #Poshmark closet: Golden State Warriors (Stephen Curry) - BKBL [10_SC5]. https://t.co/92ijI9Lp7Y #shopmycloset @poshmarkapp@PCDawg02 @RocketNerd1 @blg1435 @bucspadresfan @espn @AdamSchefter @warriors Why do you keep saying this over and over?

There's no world in which the Warriors would be a huge underdog to anyone at this point.@freddy531 @TonzerWee @warriors So what? It can shoot 20 people in a matter of seconds.

This series is over. #Celtics #BleedGreen@warriors I really feel sad and hope that Americans can bravely say no to guns@MiamiHEAT I don't know who needs to know this but the Celtics are not winning, the Heat is losing miserably. They can't suck more, they look like a completely different team, very anemic. A team made from Boston and Miami starts, still can't beat the warriors and I don't like Golden StateI’d rather cheer for @The_MJF than cheer for the @warriors. And the former is the same as the latter. #AEW #DubNation #AEWDynamite #NBA75Either one of these teams #celtics #heat will be getting run out of the building by @warriors #NBAPlayoffs@warriors Need more great hero’s like Steve. Not afraid to stand up.@warriors Coach is right.

And it is utterly ridiculous that the league made you play that game last night.@warriors I really feel sad and hope that Americans can be brave and say no like a gun@Nbailey63942641 @mrdailylocks @warriors Mass shootings dont happen in other countries, please digest this.
66% of mass shootings happens in 1 country. This is dated but things haven't changed in last 8 years https://t.co/InQSEBTi4x@Petewrestling @k4grenac @ThaGreenGiant @RTomasi7 @rpetty @warriors How do dictators gain power?@lanebaseball03 @ToddFellbaum @NickWhitley_ @warriors Neither, having a gun or being a back yard militant makes you a crack shot, or physically capable of dealing with a high stress life or death situation. Adding 1 more gun to a gunfight just makes it a bigger gunfight and makes it that much likelier than MORE peopl will die.@warriors Amen!  If Europe can fix this why can't  we?  I will tell you why - because America cares more about guns than Children's lives!  How sad!@TonzerWee @warriors SEMI means it shoots one bullet at a time. 90% of these people outraged over the weapon have no idea how it works. It’s not an automatic.When you pull the trigger it fires ONE bullet. It’s mechanics are the same as most firearms.@kyngromaine @RakuShokuJ Because the warriors offense out guns their defense. This is golden state with a top5 offensive player ever@lvstckcmplcncy @k4grenac @ThaGreenGiant @RTomasi7 @rpetty @warriors So if you believe that will happen the second you aren’t allowed to have guns that says a lot about the people YOU voted into power

Simple as that.@andysmi45016210 @sdcrypto76 @rpetty @warriors I agree. That’s an idea along with others that could help. Mental health is a huge issue and the reason these things happen in the first place. But nothings full proof.End the series tomorrow @warriors@nprpolitics Steve Kerr is a Warrior’s warrior. 

Once he brings another NBA title to the Golden State, he should consider switching to a full-time role in the political arena. 

We need a leader who knows how to win. And this is a battle for the soul of our nation.@lilhjelly @isjanosnba @warriors Celtics fan here, I'm not a pit viper dumbass and you're a purple dork NUFD@MSNBC @thereidout That was a good message from a really good basketball coach in Steve Kerr of the Golden State Warriors.

So it will be Celtics and GSW on the finals.
Go @warriors! 😁 https://t.co/nqMMVVZZvbI will say this, IF @dallasmavs win ALL the remaining games in #WCF and eliminate the @warriors, I WILL OFFICIALLY boycott the @NBA and calling foul on the NBA for DESTROYING the lovely game of basketball by RIGGING IT! #Rigged@warriors @Bucks @MiamiHEAT don’t do it 😂😂😂 https://t.co/eRomzKE9l1Thank you @MiamiHEAT!

Let’s go further back 6 years ago. Warriors only lost 8 games and not even a home game all year until they faced the Celtics on April Fools. I remember that game specifically since that was a death of a family member@piyushmittal An Steve Kerr  of Golden State Warriors , spoke out at a Press Conf. today ; saying 50 Senators Are Holding the majority of American People HOSTAGE , by NOT ALLOWING CONGRESS TO VOTE ON GUN MEASURES IN AMERICA 💙🔥💂👸🇺🇸🍀🔥Celtics/Warriors is the Finals matchup everyone wants anyway.

The three teams I was worried about: Bucks, Heat and Warriors.@WendellJohnst10 @tribbs626 @TonzerWee @warriors Oh, so you’re signing up with the Military or National Guard? They’ll provide you with weapons.

The amount of iso mid range shots Miami take and the lack of shooting they have are the opposite of Golden State!@DerTroll13 @GBond187 @warriors Nope. There’s nothing you can really do. It has went on for centuries, through time guns have evolved making the death toll larger but taking away guns is not the answer. If you do they will find another way to harm people. Such as bombs@veyg @erick_will_argu @EmbiidJuulel @just_a_rand0 @sdcrypto76 @rpetty @warriors “Granted it works”

Seeing as more guns hasn’t worked in the last 30 years maybe tryimg something different is at the very least worth a goBest NBA Finals

However with a 50-50 Senate, it's not going to get done.  I believe they need at least 60 votes.@BigCiscoShow @warriors What makes him qualified is that he’s an American just like us who is tired of the senseless killings that happen at places where people should feel safe at.

I’m just not into mass punishment while the actual criminals go wildCoach Kerr of th Golden State Warriors has it right:90% of Americans support bkgd checks &amp; a major % want restricts on sales of assault rifles, etc. etc. but we’re being “held hostage” by 50 senators - 50 NRA-owned  cowards w the blood of children &amp; other innocents on their hands@warriors These poor families. Once again the USA finds itself in the same position because of a basic refusal to ‘AMEND’ some archaic amendment that has ZERO relevance in 2022.

We still remember last time you were at the mic calling to defund the police presence in schools, hypocrite.@warriors Absolutely 100%!!!!@lvstckcmplcncy @k4grenac @ThaGreenGiant @RTomasi7 @rpetty @warriors I feel safe going about my business and I don’t have a gun

Yet you need everyone to have guns to “feel safe”@Prince15081967 @warriors Yeah, it’s called the world wide webs, but I’ll let you keep believing your half cocked opinion based on a Facebook meme 🙄Send Dallas to Hell so you can send Boston to the Shadow Realm. @warriors@warriors @violadavis This had me in tears because I feel his frustration and everything he said was on point.

There was 30 deaths by guns in the uk in 19/20 
In the USA in 2020 there was 20000 deaths by guns 

So who’s actually safer

Fuck even our knife deaths are less then the USA per capita

Most 3rd world countries are safer to visit.@lvstckcmplcncy @k4grenac @ThaGreenGiant @RTomasi7 @rpetty @warriors Yet in this “unnatural hierarchy” in other countries they don’t have theses mass gun shootings on such a regular occurrence

We don’t have police shooting citizens on a whim at a average of 70 death a MONTH

Yet where guns are free available with citizens and police it does@itsworldclass @warriors These teams can’t compete with them I’ve seen enough@Free_6rightZ @warriors Man, anyone. &amp; we use to shrug our shoulders whenever an adult told us how important voting was. He deserves a standing ovation@warriors Cmon America. Wake up. Please 🙏🙏“Never mind whether you agree with him on gun reform.

And only ONE country has lax gun laws for its citizens

Do you think that’s all some weird coincidence for the last 30 years or something@latimes @warriors Don't forget to post what he said 2 years ago about having a police presence at schools.Game 5 2morrow for the warriors &amp; mbv avs

Congratulations to the Golden State Warriors on winning their 5th NBA championship 🎉@kevmarsden2 @eddie_skezzz @warriors Banning guns does not work lol.@eddie_skezzz @warriors The mentality here! arm the teachers, the kids, OMG what a sick nation.

No reason for others.who would the @warriors rather play ? @MiamiHEAT or @celtics ?@eddie_skezzz @warriors That worked well at Columbine didn't it.  Hand guns vs an AR15?  An armed camp is not conducive to education.  Only in America is an assault rifle worth more than the lives of children.@kmitchell49 @cromwellian @JamesZaky @Prince15081967 @warriors Boohoo save others, US doesn't do rats ass unless it sees profit for itself.My new hero!

You don’t need police at school, when you have the correct laws in place.

Make it harder for people to get them or you’ll just keep having kids murdered in school each and every year@transient_sc @teamisurus @k23_esports Man we need normal sports like NBA .. that would be lit! How cool would @warriors v @dallasmavs be right now@AnufakCraig @TonzerWee @warriors that school district has is own police force and the three officers at the school ran away from the shooter because they had minor injuries and thought he had body armor when he did not.@warriors Stick to coaching!  Background checks would have revealed zero regarding yesterday’s event. If you want, make a real stand, but maybe just stick to what you know.@espn @warriors We are watching End Time happen right before our very eyes.

They are ONLY allowed to have them while doing their job and only fire them in extreme circumstances and each time it’s fired they are asked why they fired it

They DO NOT take them home@CanadianChaos4 @FestusEzeli @warriors Your current team is so far from that 2019 team anyway??

You shouldn’t need police in your schools in the first place. Yank@warriors This you steve https://t.co/9TD9Yhj3HE@Kris_Ruppel @Tiger4life78 @natealert @Dz1005 @warriors It is moronic think that at least taking the guns away from people with mental health issues or who are literally threatening violence will not save lives.
Deflection doesn’t work when there are more mass shootings in the US than days ins the year.@JoelBrock25 @TonzerWee @Serkazong @taighsolais @warriors you sorta can, the shoot from robb elementary bought his gun online. extremely convenient@warriors Usa kill world https://t.co/A1uEd6SxpE@Ya_Boy_Virg @warriors Yet it works extremely well in the rest of the world 

Why do you think this problem is solely a US one??

Why do school shooting happen so regular in the US and NO WHERE ELSE??

Gee I wonder what could be the problem@JustAKidwHoop @AJNIntel @warriors You bitch about mass shootings but how much have you complained about all the violence and senseless killings in inner cities across America?

@warriors coach Steve Kerr gave his best pregame speech ever Tuesday night.

He’s pleading for better gun control, and he’s talking to you.

Time to 'Vote Them Out!' of office. If they can't resolve issues, we need legislators who can. All of you on both sides of the aisle who lack backbone and the ability to work out solutions to complex issues!

If anyone hasn't seen this video of the press conference before last night's game please watch it. 💯 https://t.co/rmJduPeuq2I get the feeling that either Boston or Miami will be too beat up to hold up against a healthy (and likely very well rested) Golden State team in the Finals.

When a person lives over 30mins away from the closest town and is being attacked, they do not have time to wait for help. It's fight back or die.@warriors Thank you. Mr. Kerr is heroic.@AJNIntel @warriors I said the same thing, what’s a 9M gonna do against an automatic assault weapon. Even if you got it on you you ain’t reaching for it when your mind is on getting your kid’s birthday cake. Or if you leave that shit in the car and the shooter starts in the parking lot or entrance@Raghboo @warriors I hope so. But when mavs find their rhythm from deep, they seem unstoppable. That's dangerous if they keep that in the following games. And the increasing risk of injury really concerned me.

It’s uplifting, and perfectly on point. https://t.co/kZGA3XFWgz@wyoung0125 @warriors What?! Steve’s comments today are not inconsistent with the idea of removing police from schools. He is saying schools would be safer with fewer guns in society, which would reduce the need for police. Nuance is not your strong suite, huh?@NickWhitley_ @warriors The kid had no record of arrests or mental health issues so a background check would still have put guns in his hands. Kerr is clueless.

But when will you learn that's guns do not protect you? Again we've not had a mass shooting over here since we changed our laws in the 90's.

Guns don’t belong in schools. Only in America is this even up for debate. The whole world is watching us and wondering what the fuck is going on. This is only a problem here, where the gun lobby reigns supreme.@RyanKbunyan @jimmy68camaro @TruthBearer22 @scottydub3715 @McLean_Deluxe @donato501 @unbiasedgswfan @espn @warriors Prove to me that it's not a myth. Every white person that does anything is called a "white supremacist", including the Buffalo shooter who literally said that he thinks of himself as more of a progressive Leftist than anything, but was still tagged a WS.@warriors Powerful and very very very relevant. I hope more people with influence speak up fir the innocent victims just like Steve did.@brucefenton @warriors How does it “prevent violence” exactly

The uk doesn’t have guns yet your crime rate is worse then ours hell your knife deaths are worse then ours 

Your guns literally are making things worse

Why do you think these school shoots are a regular occurrence in the US ONLY??Now that I've been a rabid @Warriors fan for about 7 years, it's become apparent to me that the @NBA is mainly about money 🤑🤑🤑 💰💰💰 #CorporateGreed https://t.co/2ASasNFez8@theladymononoke @Vidian6 @warriors Yeah, that killed me. The little 10 year old girl holding her honor certificate that she got that very day. 😭@warriors Thank you Steve Kerr.@JonFlan Beto stood up and told Abbot he was part of the problem. That is courage. NBA Golden State Warriors Coach Kerr called Moscow Mitch and his Republican Senators “PATHETIC” H.R.8 Universal Background Check Bill in McConnel’s desk 2 years. We have to do something!@leanbellyy @warriors He’s getting older, you can’t shoot like he does forever@KoBaLo6 @TonzerWee @warriors I was asking Tom moreso than you. But as I said, you’re definitely welcome to answer.@smiles2322 @Katquatch @GBond187 @warriors Wow, stricter rules wouldn’t work, we have tried nothing and nothing seems to work how about give it a try because not taking action and making excuses like you are is getting kids killed.@AntGodbey @Alice_Wonders_3 @remuli @JustinCreech86 @warriors You mean like when Dunblane happened over here in the 90's, and since then there's not been a mass shooting?
Are you actually trying to say taking guns of the German public caused WW2, and not Hitler?@ThatguyDan18 @itchycalf_ @LuIsUrIbE169 @phyllis_fu @warriors A reply of someone who is unable to grasp that their way of thinking is outdated. Honestly, you seem to have the mentality of an infanthttps://t.co/Qga3FCzBK3 Sports world reacts to Texas school shooting. "No more moments of silence!" Golden State Warriors head coach calls for Congress to mandate background checks, stop gun violence, "do something!" for families, kids. 🌹🙏 #Uvalde #sportsreaction #NBA@warriors Shall not be infringed. We already have background checks for gun purchases. Laws already exist and they didn't stop this tragedy. More laws won't fix this situation. It's not the guns fault.@KoBaLo6 @juliettbarnard @TonzerWee @warriors Again, I’m not comparing them. We have British people here, obviously aware of the general topic of maiming and mayhem, and I’m curious of their thoughts. Again, if you’re British, you’re welcome to answer my question too.@blk_capitalist @KatieSaysStuff1 @warriors Ummmm…you don’t think that shooting will stop with the police? Because spoiler alert it hasn’t. Keep the guns out of these kids hands. THAT is where it start.It’s safe to say the 2022 NBA champion Golden State Warriors earned it@eddie_skezzz @warriors Unless it happens to their children or someone in their lives they won't make a change. They will just hold our rights hostage like Kerr is saying.@Benjami64597721 @warriors My daughter's school in "East Berlin", Colorado locks the school down every day, only opening doors before and after school. If you're a visitor, you push an intercom button and talk to a camera/speaker.

You saying “it’s a myth doesn’t make it true.

“An American right” that was created in the 1700s when the only guns were single shot and take 5 minutes to reload. It’s about time that right was updated to match the technology of 21st century@eddie_skezzz @warriors Wow yeah cuz that will stop the shooter. At sandy hook there was a cop there and he refused to go in. At the store in NY, there was a security guard with a gun who shot at the offender and was killed himself. Guns don't stop guns, laws will and these Republicans dnr give a shyt.@Quicktake @warriors I wonder if all notable sports figures, musicians, artists of all stripes, got this loud and consistently passionate, would change occur? What does it take to move their cemented hold on power?@warriors It won’t solve all of the problems, but it’s a start.@OSiochainM @StellYori @Quicktake @warriors Unfortunately i think this is just 1 of many that need to happen. 
I thought he didn’t get a background check but later saw he bought from a licensed dealer which would have required it.

Maybe you should worry more about that than us. https://t.co/h49ISJrsNO@cabronestrange @espn @warriors Civics lesson. It takes 60 votes to pass laws in the Senate. Most Americans see that there are 50 Republicans Senators who refuse to act. Most Americans see that this obstructionist malfeasance allows this murder of children to persist. Most Americans are disgusted by this.@JustinCreech86 @AntGodbey @Iordebae @JohnsonDutch @warriors You reckon he would have killed 15 people with a knife?@warriors Thank you @warriors. My heart hurts! He is so right!!! Let’s vote them out. Your vote matters!!!Warriors close out attempt Take 2. Golden State is -7 at @DKSportsbook and @JimBarnesLV says the early money is on the Dubs.

The world is watching, and judging. #SteveKerr@espn @warriors You condone games on TV where kids supposedly kill people. In their mind they go to a school and play a game. Get all shooting off TV no matter what it is. We had guns when I was a kid but never had shootings in schools. What we never had was TV.

There are changes that need to happen, but taking away arms from people who are law abiding citizens isn't one.@warriors where is steve kerr after 28 people were shot in chicago were shot last week?  Why does he never mention the POC killed there every weekend@warriors #SALUTE for using your platform to speak Truth to power!@Stephen79682328 @ThaGreenGiant @SEPHIR0B @RTomasi7 @rpetty @warriors “Birthright”
