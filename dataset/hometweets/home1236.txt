This prediction is assuming Luka Doncic is back by game 3. I do think Dallas can stay afloat until then and I’m a huge believer in Luka’s greatness. I think this series goes the distance, and I trust Luka in a game 7 at Utah.

#NBAPlayoffs2022 #NBAPlayoffs 

https://t.co/E4z1jxBgXhLFG MAVS #MFFL @dallasmavsDallas Mavericks vs. Utah Jazz Preview

While Luka's injury looms large, the Jazz have struggled to close out games and are on a downward slide. Momentum &amp; health may dictate this series, as will the cohesion of Donovan Mitchell and Rudy Gobert

Prediction: Jazz in 7 https://t.co/ZFKdaX0G9yThe #NBA75  Playoffs begin when the Utah Jazz (-5.5) take on the Dallas Mavericks (+175)

🏀Dallas is 6-1-1 ATS in their last 8 games
🏀Utah is 2-8-1 ATS in their last 11 games
🏀The Jazz have failed to cover their last 5 games against the Mavericks https://t.co/bd6qu1RGd9@MavsTracker @ESPNNBA @AACenter @dallasmavs @utahjazz @JazzUniTracker Jazz definitely win the branding battle, here.(4)Mavericks vs. Jazz(5)
Luka could potentially miss 2 games, but if he's at least healthy for game 3 then the Mavs should be ok. These two teams have looked levels apart since the all-star break. I fully expect this will be Mitchell's last season in Utah.
Dallas in 7Luka Doncic won’t play for the Dallas Mavericks in Game 1 of their playoff series against Utah because of the calf injury the All-Star guard suffered in the regular-season finale  https://t.co/bg8Y8cR2ltFrom Donovan Mitchell to Jared Butler, this is what the best version of the Jazz could look like versus the Dallas Mavericks and beyond. #utahjazz #NBAPlayoffs

We're #dALLasIN for this playoff run. https://t.co/BUKJ2q6172The @dallasmavs disrespect by @espn &amp; @SportsCenter is BAD. REAL BAD. Only 15 teams on a graphic talking about 16 teams and LAC (included) is already eliminated, while the team left out (Dallas) is…the 4th Seed in the better conference. 🤨 https://t.co/D8diMAHzUbthe Dallas Mavericks are playing in the local professional basketball league’s tournament starting today. it’s a good day.And this is just Arsenal, Dallas Mavericks are yet to send my head flying thru the roof. FML.Dallas went 5-1 SU in its last 6 games without Doncic who is doubtful for today’s Game 1 vs Utah.

The Jazz defeated a Doncic-less Mavericks squad in Utah on Christmas Day 120-116.

Let's start with the Utah #Jazz vs Dallas #Mavericks. Biggest factor in game one is clearly Luka's injured calf...The Dallas Mavericks and Utah Jazz will begin the 2022 NBA playoffs with their Game 1 matchup. 

For @MavericksSI, I analyzed a few keys for the Mavs: https://t.co/K9oMP3jJu6Series winner (best of 7):

1.367 - @utahjazz 
3.250 - @dallasmavs 

#NBA | https://t.co/PGWjFnrYMs https://t.co/1YCq3r4hY1What's your prediction for Game 1 of the NBA playoffs between the Utah Jazz and Dallas Mavericks?Your time has come @jalenbrunson1 let’s gooooooooooo!!! @dallasmavs #MFFLListening to @ZachLowe_NBA talk about the @dallasmavs without @luka7doncic shows just how little he actually watched them. He literally said “idk why the @utahjazz use @rudygobert27 on Maxi or Powell, when they could hide him on @doefinney_10.” #stfu@dallasmavs @MichelobULTRA @jalenbrunson1 its all on you, brunson!TAKE NOTE: The first round of the NBA Playoffs gets underway for the @UtahJazz and @dallasmavs at 11am.

Slowing him down will be a priority in Game 1.

(Funny) New Segment: Come on Bro!!
https://t.co/0wnZL7eTrtThe media (and Twitter) omits how well The Dallas Mavericks have played since the new year. If the season started Jan. 1st, the Mavs would be on pace for 62+ wins. 

This is a TEAM that has found something &amp; will not go away, Luka or no Luka.

I know Luka is out for Game 1 but there is a chance the Mavs "steal" this game.

Take control of your recovery with @therabody. #MFFL https://t.co/tVx4QRg9h9@ScammerSultan @dallasmavs I literally made a $20 bet they’d get out the first round 😭Dallas Mavericks are in trouble, as Luka Doncic is officially ruled OUT for Game1 of RD1 vs the Utah Jazz and via @wojespn he could ALSO be OUT for Game2 vs Utah. I’m sure Dallas is scrambling in their playbook to draw some new things up to make up for Luka’s absence #NBA(Please don't embarrass me @dallasmavs)Damn shame. It was not worth it @dallasmavs https://t.co/AHnJ19AlFV@dallasmavs our star player is out for game 1 of the playoffs because I stupid fucking decision was made to let him play as many minutes as he did. Can someone in this organization use some common fucking sense please?!Dallas Mavericks are 8-9 without Luka Doncic this season.

Wondering if Spencer Dinwiddie or Jalen Brunson will be the one to soak up most of those minutes. Coach Jason Kidd tried to space apart the two guards so they didn’t share the floor this season@elonmusk Love u more.. Now Buy the Dallas MavericksThought Dallas really had a run in them. Hope Luka Doncic can return in time to give the Mavericks a fair shot.@dallasmavs @Chime Soooo, is Luka playing or not?3 years in a row going into the playoffs and you hurt.
