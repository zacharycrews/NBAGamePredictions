I mean holy shit enough is enough with this rotation bullshit. Just because you beat the *checks notes* Sacramento Kings (without Fox) doesn’t mean all these problems went away I mean cmon@SPTSJUNKIE At some point we've got to realize that Sacramento ruins players. Luka would be just as washed if Sac drafted him
(Ref. Every kings pick ever that went on to be a good player elsewhere)@jjdubu @SacramentoKings Here’s an idea - let’s have Tony LaRussa take over as Kings coachDue to incompetence in evaluation and due to injuries and Covid, The Sacramento Kings have only played three games this season with what should be their everyday starting five of Haliburton, Fox, Barnes, Bagley and Holmes. They are 2-1 in those games. #Kings #NBA@SacramentoKings @MichelobULTRA @TyHaliburton22 Tyrese is 🐐@SacramentoKings @MichelobULTRA @TyHaliburton22 At least social media wise, you're building around Tyrese.

We need to keep packing on the losses. We've made some serious progress up the draft ladder.if the Sacramento Kings traded Harrison Barnes, Hield, De'aaron Fox, and Richaun Holmes for as many first round picks and expiring filler contracts as possible we'd really fast track a good rebuild.hopefully the sacramento kings are some chicken noodle soup for these ailing nets tomorrow night. if not, they down bad frI wish @DevinBook played for the @SacramentoKingsI only keep kings around me sacramento style@CrashStL 2003 I was a huge NBA fan, favorite team was the Sacramento Kings.
