@MLSEPR @ScotiabankArena @MapleLeafs @Raptors @chef_zielinski @AfrimPristine @Cheese_Boutique @colibritoronto @CherryStBBQ @globalnewsto @CBCToronto Hey, got a question regarding the box tickets from last year game but got cancelled due to the lockdown. Please need a guidance with these. Thanks.Kyle Lowry is easily the most beloved Toronto Raptor in franchise history.

DeMar DeRozan, in my opinion, is easily the second.@watanabesmile @Raptors Enjoyy!!You best believe the Bulls winning the game but @Raptors are good with me too.

Here’s what people are saying: https://t.co/8gMa8Cj3WbFrom the 🎧 Podcast Player

https://t.co/Gq78qPyubhIn a Star selective, sources uncovered that Edward Rogers effectively battled against plans to keep Toronto Raptors president Masai Ujiri as top of the group, saying he did not merit the value tag.

#njdigitaltv #njdigitaltvcanada #Raptors #fans #EdwardRogers #MasaiUjiri https://t.co/aBxOSHrIuSScottie Barnes has been everything the Raptors could've asked for, and then some.

See why I'm super high on his potential and why I think the Toronto Raptors have a future star on their hands.

You treated Masai Ujiri like that? Clearly all you care about is $$. The way your company already gouges customers is a prime example of that. Largest cell phone bills of any developed nation? Thanks 🤮Raptors fans!! Listen, I love DeMar, but we best kick his butt today.  We NEED this win, we can't be losing our first three games on our home court.  Not Infront of the best fan base in the world. Look for Raps to come out on a mission.

I picked this one up today as well 🤙@timandfriends DeRozan IMO is the 2nd greatest Raptor in franchise history just behind Lowry who takes the 1st spot. DeMar was always a class act while in Toronto. The fact that he wanted to stay a Raptor and resigned when he had offers to go elsewhere speaks volumes. #TimandFriends https://t.co/ra1CtZ70CV@TorontoStar @christinedobby Given how respected he is and how much access he has, I’d guess that @smithraps received most of the off-the-record detail from Masai himself, with other @Raptors and @NBA sources confirming details.Story: Ed Rogers is making a power play against his family board for complete control of the company.

Toronto: Yawn.

Story: Ed Rogers tried to oust Masai Ujiri and told him he wasn't worth the money.

Toronto: This lunatic must be run out of town.

via @GoogleNewsEdward Rogers fought plans to keep Masai Ujiri in place as head of the Toronto Raptors, according to this scoop by my former colleague @christinedobby and @SmithRaps 
https://t.co/8o9QxyKU95@SmithRaps @christinedobby The question is why?? Do the @Raptors enjoy making money. The franchise would have been in the toilet if they lost another big name.  #WeTheNorth@Raptors @champagnepapi Does he pay your bills? Does he have a percentage of ownership? Why kiss his ass? Where was he during the dark times for this franchise? Came around when they started winning. Im@a fan of the Raps but Drake is annoying.Just realized I'm gonna be in a work meeting with my friend who's a bulls fan during the game 😈

Can't wait to leave and see the @raptors up by 30@ctsbulls @chicagobulls @Raptors @670TheScore Still miss you Chuck. It’s pretty cool that you’re calling games for @DeMar_DeRozan now. I think Demar was drafted right after you left? #WeTheNorthBell and Telus may want to bump up the number of customer service agents this week.   @Raptors fans are looking for non-rogers cell carriers... https://t.co/W9xahEtIALIt’s game day for the @Raptors. Can they beat the undefeated Chicago Bulls ?? #letsgoraptors #WeTheNorth #toronto #bulls #NBA75 https://t.co/lBqWmc9pWmChicago Raptors vs Toronto Raptors, who you got?
