He just overpays average players to give us average numbers,he throws away our picks too@trentsznn @trailblazers You forget,Billups stood there and said he wanted Billups?? You think the franchise gon ignore Dame??? 
You should be against Dame bruh@trentsznn @trailblazers Bruh Dane put up 11 pts..2 pts in second half and you are talking about coach and stuff,the dude that wanted a change so that we improve,wanted Billups,the same dude hasn’t pushed for CJ to be traded,the same dude comes here and put up 11 pts and you are talking against BillupsNBA

#TheGamePlan@ATinhofer @PrimeSurtain @trailblazers Bruh dude made them fire stotts for you,traded Gary Trent for you,Lost our picks and DJJ for you,and previous moves just to improve the team,yet you yourself is the team’s problem,he chews minutes yet..brings nothing ,you come here and give us 11 pts..really @Dame_Lillard ??@PriestLakeDan @trailblazers Take CJ out of the equation. And put Nassir in instead. Really norm should have CJ’s spots.@Pure2k_ @trailblazers Nas,Ant,Greg and Lance ..then Norm to guide the young players ,trade the rest and fire Neil,Team owner is a joke@gil96022742 @trailblazers Yeah but the people nurk and Simons were guarding went off. Rudy had 21 and Clarkson had 22. They can’t defend. Simons might score but he still gets lost defensively against good teams which hurts us. And don’t get me started on CJ’s defense..@trailblazers My love for this team is beyond winning and losing. #RipCity@SnellSeason @trailblazers This is why ur the goat.@PriestLakeDan @trailblazers I keep Saying,the problem with @trailblazers isn’t about the players or coach,it’s about the owner..who employed Neil??? What Resume did Neil have before Portland??? 8 years,hasn’t done anything..yet he’s still working there and goes dinner with team owner sometimes@trailblazers perfect time to announce you have fired Olshey…@SoleSavy @trailblazers @steve_604 @T1m0ne @DaveyGill @rondell_phillip @JukeJamAsh @eatnotmeat @ArturoEMercado Thank you so much!! Best Christmas present!!Interesting parallels between the @trailblazers and the @Seahawks. My 2 favorite teams and my 2 favorite players @Dame_Lillard and @DangeRussWilson. Consistent winners with superstar players. Possible major changes coming for both teams. I miss Paul Allen.@iHoosier4 @trailblazers Bruh Dame has been poor since,you know his +|- ???@chaseowens96 @trailblazers Oh I’m done with the franchise,people talk about Neil not being good,bruh someone employed Neil,you think if the team owner was serious ..he would still be there,since 2012,can’t put together a good line up,since 2015,can’t bring in an all star..@ripcityproject @trailblazers@thevowel @trailblazers @steelers @Seahawks @SeattleKraken @Mariners Thankfully, I gave up on all college sports years ago or it’d be even tougher.
Pay to win doesn’t interest me 😄
College football is like a fantasy keeper league. The best programs stay the best, there’s little to no parity. 
Meh.This @trailblazers touring company just doesn't live up to the off N Broadway show. #RipCity #Nolshey@trailblazers Will we ever win a road game, ever again?@trailblazers Losing by 20 or more points again on the road.

So sorry@ProtestaBloc @ChrisTo52753524 @trailblazers Bruh the defeat on road at some point in time will affect home games and we’ll be losing at home,that’s how it works,this franchise needs to push the rebuild button already,Dame,CJ,Roco,Nurkic…all out,leave Lance,Ant,Little,Greg,Elleby and Norm to guide the kids @trailblazers@MitchMossRadio @paulyhoward has there ever been easier money than fading the @trailblazers on the road?@LandonHeller5 @trailblazers Pistons you say??

It’s an obvious dead end with the roster. DO SOMETHING!!@trailblazers Blow up the rosterSports-wise, it’s been a rough year!
My @trailblazers are Jekyll &amp; Hyde.
My @steelers are brutal.
My “other” team, the @Seahawks need to blow it up.
The @SeattleKraken look like the expansion team that they are.

Lots of talent on this roster but it’s talent that doesn’t work together the way we want it to. Seems like changes need to be made.@FalcoNat38 @trailblazers crying and throwing up for horsey@trailblazers So, about that defense (and also, So...about that starting of 2 bad defensive guards...). 

oh and So, about that investigation into Neil...

Oh and So...maybe, i don't know, don't start 3 guards?The @trailblazers offensive approach ain’t it 🤷🏽‍♂️…dame game in a strait Jacket.

About to hang it up for seasonIf not anything,I’m done with @trailblazers and the Dame train,dude is not serious,Franchise is a joke,Coach is a joke,Owner is not interested,Neil is the biggest joke there is,a team that wants to win,bringing in a rookie coach and giving him a poor roster..wow@trailblazers Tough loss! Happy that our team is coming home. It's been a long road trip.♥️🖤11pts 6rb 5ast is not a good looking stat line for a superstar. He's telling you to make big moves @trailblazers. Do it! He's tired and so are we. #RipCity ❤️ 🖤@UtahRabbi had more juice than the @trailblazers tonight. https://t.co/MlajHQBeA1Jodi Allen's .@Seahawks and .@Trailblazers are almost unwatchable they are so bad thanks to Pete Carroll and Neal Olshey.
#NFL #NBA@moelaarag0 @trailblazers Ight man@trailblazers you suck😡@DakToLuka @trailblazers Bruh Luka is only 22 and you guys made the playoffs twice with a decent seed you’ll be just fine. While we have dame whose 31 slowly leaving his prime and has never had a reliable second option since LA. We are not the same sorry 😂😂@Nibble_2x2 @trailblazers We fired our gm, who was the longest tenured in the league, we hired a new one but doesn’t matter because Mark Cuban is our owner, and he doesn’t give at about the team, wasting Lukas career@BrendanHeath45 @trailblazers And that win was against the damn Rockets 🤦🤦🤦@trailblazers Anyone remember when Dame was good? How about the last time this empty calorie stat hunting clown team actually played any defense?@DakToLuka @trailblazers does your team have a shitty gm too?@trailblazers The .@trailblazers are almost unwatchable they are so bad.
#NBA@trailblazers You're breaking my wife's heart! 😖@moelaarag0 @trailblazers Nah man we’ve had the same below average core since 2019, and we can’t beat a good team unless Luka drops 40 each game. Cause our roster is horrible, we have the worst center rotation in the league. I’d love to have zeller on my team, that’s how Down bad I am@trailblazers Start the rebuild please and keep nas and ant😁@trailblazers defend anything https://t.co/mTv18YvDsP22-point victory for the Utah Jazz over the Portland Trail Blazers! #NBA75

Visit https://t.co/K9jJDOXjil for other updates. https://t.co/gMNXgrZ31x@trailblazers It is time to break this team up and start over. You can't have a team be below average with the two best players over the age of 30 years old.@trailblazers Tank for Chet@ChrisTo52753524 @trailblazers 45 games is a stretch we’re on pace for 42@trailblazers Do these guys even care anymore???@LandonHeller5 @trailblazers The pistons 😂😂@AnotherDame @trailblazers Hard to get a rhythm when he shoots the ball 3 times per quarter… and CJ does the same thing so why don’t we have dame be the one iso’ing and jacking shots uo instead of CJ@trailblazers The Malignant Tumor of Basketball Operations needs to be removed.@DakToLuka @trailblazers Mavs are literally 10-9 while Luka missed multiple games u guys are just fine@DamesMVPszn @trailblazers We’re cooked, we lost to cavs by 30, and our roster is actually so bad, they should be in the g-league. I’d literally do anything to get norm or cj on my team@trailblazers it should be clear. Trade CJ, start Ant pickup a strong SF. If you can get a starting caliber 3 then it’s Dame, Norm, trade, RoCo, Nurk. If you can’t get a starter then Dame, Ant, Norm, RoCo, Nurk. And tbh, you may be able to start Nas instead of Ant if you want a bigger lineup.@trailblazers Just seeing Lillard upset on the bench just let's you know he's gonna pop off against the pistons and show the NBA who he really is. #GoBlazers@trailblazers Hello lost and found have you seen the Blazer defense???Trail Blazers are 10-11 overall and 1-10 on the road. Only the 4-16 Houston Rockets have a worse road record. 

How we feeling, Portland? #RipCity https://t.co/laiABsqaW6End of the game: Blazers lost 

2nd half defensive woes left the @trailblazers playing from behind from the jump. Other than Ant playing well, not much else to be excited about. Still a lot of games left on the season.

POR : 107 - UTA : 129 https://t.co/OSg3AgydiK@trailblazers painThey're suffering.
