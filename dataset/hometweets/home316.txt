But they will be doing it on their own with no help from the front office. In the mean time, cherish every minute of Nas and Ant, hope that they keep improving, and count every dunk twice.The Portland Trail Blazers gave up two 1st Round picks and Trevor Ariza to get Robert Covington, just to start the PF position, and you thought it was a fair deal. You have no right to complain about his game right now lol. Noah Vonleh is in China but a much much better PF.@tamarackmusic @DannyMarang @diandraann @trailblazers What it seems like to me is that no one at the top of the organization cares and it shows.

If you can get a starting caliber 3 then it‚Äôs Dame, Norm, trade, RoCo, Nurk. If you can‚Äôt get a starter then Dame, Ant, Norm, RoCo, Nurk. And tbh, you may be able to start Nas instead of Ant if you want a bigger lineup.@trailblazers Just seeing Lillard upset on the bench just let's you know he's gonna pop off against the pistons and show the NBA who he really is. #GoBlazers@trailblazers Hello lost and found have you seen the Blazer defense???Trail Blazers are 10-11 overall and 1-10 on the road.

How we feeling, Portland? #RipCity https://t.co/laiABsqaW6End of the game: Blazers lost 

2nd half defensive woes left the @trailblazers playing from behind from the jump. Other than Ant playing well, not much else to be excited about. Still a lot of games left on the season.
