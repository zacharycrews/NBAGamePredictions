Both are critical to what the Utah Jazz do and they complement each other really well. https://t.co/2rpxwd28cv@utahjazz We are Glad you're here. Mostly important is It's not only great when you're Winning but Winning and having fun is contagious.@utahjazz Udoka Azubuike looks so promising. He's caring to much upper body mass and weight for his lower body. Knees and Ankles are career ending injuries. I would think twice about drafting rookies. I would be more inclined to trade my draft picks for seasoned veterans.22:30 – 🏀NBA

But regardless of how you feel about individual net ratings, you have to love that out of 256 qualified players, 4 and 5 look like this.
