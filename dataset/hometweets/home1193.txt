I‚Äôm not going to dismiss the idea but hear me out. Wouldn‚Äôt it be more beneficial to have him come off the bench so he can mask the non-defense of the second lineup? #takenote #utahjazzWelp‚Ä¶ gotta love getting tickets to a game to watch the reserves‚Ä¶ thanks @utahjazz https://t.co/sQAOiCHqio@gerjox @utahjazz It‚Äôs smart@kevinlc20 @andyblarsen @spidadmitchell @utahjazz Bummer‚Ä¶hope she still has fun!@sodevine679 @andyblarsen @spidadmitchell @utahjazz I remember when the @utahjazz had guys that were in great shape like Stockton and Malone.

Resting otherwise healthy players is weak.@BensHoops @utahjazz I don't blame them for resting key players.

However, as a starting unit, how many games have they played together after the beginning of the year?

Either way Jordan Clarkson is cooking, he leads the @utahjazz with 18 points on NBA League Pass.

Watch Here: https://t.co/oz9UCQxdQa https://t.co/d9RBCjeVh5At the end of the third quarter, we are tied 83-83. It‚Äôs crazy to think that right now we have 6 players in double figures. Playing a 9 man rotation tonight I find that to be a representation of sharing the ball along with 17 assists.

He told Bryson he would get him to a game once he was healthy. 2 years later post heart tx Donovan reconnected with Bryson. #TakeNote¬†  @jazzdoinggood @utahjazz https://t.co/C2CUOhYHkDTriple de Mike! #utahjazz #TakeNoteQuick timeout by the Grizzlies as the Jazz lead 9-3 with 9:33 left in the first quarter.

#TakeNote #UtahJazz #NBA75@mcconkatroid @utahjazz @ATTSportsNetRM @ZoneSportsNet @vivintarena You must be a Lakers fan.no thoughts, just 3-pointers@utahjazz @jazzteamstore @JordanClarksons Do they have passes to Rudy Gobert at the team store?@utahjazz @ATTSportsNetRM @ZoneSportsNet @vivintarena People are complaining about lost leads but they shouldn't. With the Jazz having a severely exhausting stretch, with injuries, and building huge leads anyway, I really like their playoff chances. 
This is a great team and I'm betting on them to do very well.Steven Adams is one of a few who typically dominate Gobert. #UtahJazz #GobertLET'S GO!!! #utahjazz #TakeNoteThe Utah Jazz are falling apart‚Ä¶I need Donovan Mitchell to run away. https://t.co/UEzGqb7oB7@BensHoops @utahjazz @memgrizz Losing the the fourth quarters is an issue .
