The Lakers lack movement offensively. It’s like Frank tries to hide guys because they can’t do this or that instead of running something that every player can do which is pass, cut, and screen. 90s Utah Jazz@utahjazz Trade him he's average anyways.

https://t.co/gblNlj7hvKDonovan Mitchell (rest) and Mike Conley (injury maintenance) are both OUT for the Utah Jazz tonight vs. OKC. Trent Forrest (concussion protocol) is QUESTIONABLE.@BensHoops @utahjazz Are we sure gobert is not joining them? Seems odd honestly to not rest him of all people. The thunder are about to play a bunch of G-League players 48 minutes anyway@utahjazz @spidadmitchell Haha. I doubt any kid in Utah has a Rudy poster on their wall. It’s all about Spida for my kids.@utahjazz Guys in their 20’s needing rest…@andyblarsen Lovely. My 10 year old granddaughter, who’s waited all season to go see her favorite player, @spidadmitchell , now won’t get to see him. I remember when fans mattered to the @utahjazz. Resting otherwise healthy players is weak.@BensHoops @utahjazz I don't blame them for resting key players.

However, as a starting unit, how many games have they played together after the beginning of the year?

Perhaps it's a bit naïve to believe it'll all come together in the playoffs against stiffer competition?Fresh off another 5% NBA GOM WINNER, Joe D has an #NBA #FREEWINNER #OklahomaCityThunder #UtahJazz matchup.

The tickets have been given away.  Thanks to all. #TakeNote@gerjox @utahjazz 2020 vibes lol@utahjazz WE ARE TANKING TO 6 SEED AVOIDING SUNS LMAOThe @utahjazz are eyeing health as they prepare for the playoffs.

I have often used the California Zephyr between Salt Lake City and #Sacramento following a @SacramentoKings game at the Utah Jazz.

Lord of the rings? Sign this man. https://t.co/8T9IApVb5W@utahjazz @GetCoinZoom I watched just to see Jordan's switch, scoop, and score. At 1:27.@legendary_luka_ @utahjazz I agreeWhen Quin finally called time out after going down 10, Donovan came out inspired. He made plays that changed everything. As Memphis hit the shot to force overtime Donovan was already signaling for everyone to come with him. #UtahJazz winning@utahjazz As a Jazz fan https://t.co/ToVeck90yROperation win @utahjazz #NBAPlayoffs tickets has officially begun......✅🙏🎟 #TakeNote

Help us out!! @JordanClarksonsThey didn’t show a replay in the arena of when Donovan went down hard on the drive. Was it clean?

It’s a very long shot, but it’s possible a 3 way tie with dallas and utah, jazz would be 3rd cuz they would be division winners, then mavs would be 4th cuz they won the series against the warriors. Again, very small chance, but still mathematically possible…@Mov3sTy @utahjazz idk what team you talking about@bonjour90 @utahjazz @ashtonreinhold We’re def on the same page with this one 😂@NBAonTNT @utahjazz All just to lose in the 1st round@utahjazz showed some real grit tonight.

It’s truly incredible.Had the talk with my 3 month old…the talk where I explain that the most toxic relationship he’ll find himself in is the one where he grows up a #UtahJazz fan…gotta prep them while they’re young.The fucking @utahjazz are absolutely killing me. This game should not be close.@utahjazz somebody better be on Jackson. But is anybody really surprised this game is like this?@DeadPresPicks @utahjazz Never betting on them againI’ve never seen a team that so profoundly doesn’t want to win in crunch time like the Utah Jazz.Last timeout for Memphis as the Jazz lead 110-108 with 5.6 seconds left.

#TakeNote #UtahJazz #NBA75Rudy Gobert hits two free-throws to give the @utahjazz a 109-105 lead with 35 seconds left to play.

I should point out that the two players on the Utah Jazz that have the best court differential when they're on the court together is Rudy and Rudy and that's who was on the floor just nowDanuel House is a blessing for the Utah Jazz this season.Okay Utah Jazz fans.

Either way Jordan Clarkson is cooking, he leads the @utahjazz with 18 points on NBA League Pass.

Watch Here: https://t.co/oz9UCQxdQa https://t.co/d9RBCjeVh5At the end of the third quarter, we are tied 83-83. It’s crazy to think that right now we have 6 players in double figures. Playing a 9 man rotation tonight I find that to be a representation of sharing the ball along with 17 assists.
#TakeNote #UtahJazz #NBA75@utahjazz Showing who is boss 💪End of 3rd quarter update:
