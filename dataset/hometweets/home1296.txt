The first 2 games of this series in Phoenix absolutely flew over the total. The Suns were slowed down in Dallas, but I expect them to put up some points tonight getting back on their home court

I thought Phoenix was better than us though right? Shouldn’t they be up 3-1 or sweep already?Time for an over on the Suns team total?

Phoenix returns home for a pivotal game 5 tonight against the Mavericks, and the numbers show that there's no place like home for the Suns.

I like Schroeder@iztok_franko The problem facing the #Suns is if they pull their Centers there is zero rim protection when @luka7doncic drives for the #Mavs.  It looks like Phoenix has to shoot lights out to win tonight. #NBAPlayoffs.@brandonspikes55 Phoenix sunsLooking for 1 tic for tonight's game.

3/4 in the series vs Suns hitting 3 or more assists, and it being in Phoenix I think Luka will be doing a majority of the scoring leaving more opportunities for Brunson assists.
