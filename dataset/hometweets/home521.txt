If the Cavs don't have to give him the moon, he's worth keeping to see if he can fit in better with adequate time. If not, then yeah they could trade him.@CanavarBurak31 @cavs Lauri has brilliant season. Just poor last 2 games. Like Okoro@216kobraEli @FaartsM @cavs I think this game is more about mental strength. Rickys injury hit the boys heads. Every single player wasnt good enough. Team defence very slow and poor. I hope Allen will be back soon. Then Cedi and Darius and we will be ok. Maybe some transfers #Playoffs2022@cavs @kevinlove Pretty sure valentine is being traded since he was out of the rotation today and the lakers need floor spacers shooters. valentine for rondo sounds like a fair trade@BallySportsCLE @SerenaWinters @cavs Awesome!!!

Looks like we might get Rondo, so it should be ok defensively, but he can't really shoot.  Hopefully he and DG can play together like DG and Ricky did. We shall see.

Pangos &gt; Rondo. And to make the deal work they must waive a guy (likely locker room guy Ed Davis). Cleveland should just chill with this season's group. They aren't winning the chip this year anyhow@Lonsksk @cavs That too, but I would love to see how good these players can get individually. Lebron would limit their growth as individual stars in my opinion. I always wonder what if D Wade aged physically like Lebron. Those two could have really done more damage.

The @cavs are in SERIOUS talks with the @Lakers for a point guard, most likely Rondo. Trade value likely to be a 2RP.

More to come...@KendrickPerkins Sadly (For everybody else), the Cleveland @cavs have drafted a player in @evanmobley (for one) that is said to be one of the brightest young stars in the (Covid free) #NBA. #LetEmKnowThe Lakers are trading Rajon Rondo to the Cleveland Cavaliers.

The Lakers don't have to take back matching salary in the deal since Rondo is on a minimum contract, and could take back a non-guaranteed deal to waive
