But, they had a horrific shooting night-and have a tendency not to turn it on until late-and still won that game by 7.

The eternal bird that cyclically regenerates or is otherwise born again. Associated with the sun, a phoenix obtains new life by arising from the ashes of its predecessor.

You can't just keep tweeting unanswered 🤣🤣🤣@piusmwilson @Ema_Ayo23 @Suns @Bucks Hahaha. You won't make 20 Kagutas even@piusmwilson @fobita @Suns @Bucks Lakers payin him 40 mil a year to shoot bricks and donate turnovers@fobita @piusmwilson @Suns @Bucks Let me tweet Bron in peace then@fobita @piusmwilson @Suns @Bucks whats the currency here?@piusmwilson @Ema_Ayo23 @Suns @Bucks No worries. You are not of the ShowTime era. MJ started winning when Magic and Bird were exiting. I hope that allows you swallow saliva well 🏃‍♂️🏃‍♂️🏃‍♂️🏃‍♂️@piusmwilson @Ema_Ayo23 @Suns @Bucks Tell Bron when he is injured to learn to sit down rather than become a distraction every game with his courtside antics.
And bro, I will pay you 1k for every ball tweet you don't mention Bron. 😊@kingmos63322010 @Tishberry5 @LakeShowYo Anthony Davis was not the 1st Unit Center in the NBA Playoffs against the Phoenix Suns. 😄😄😄  Game 1 Center Drummond scored 12 points with 9 rebounds. Game 2 = 15 points with 12 rebounds for Drummond.  Game 3= 6 points with 11 rebounds.@fobita @piusmwilson @Suns @Bucks I never watched magic play@Ema_Ayo23 @piusmwilson @Suns @Bucks Nope. A pure Angelino.  Magic is my GOAT@Ema_Ayo23 @piusmwilson @Suns @Bucks I'm against black on black violence. Kyrie needs help n love@piusmwilson @Ema_Ayo23 @Suns @Bucks Mine has always been brotherly advice that you shouldn't bring your King to every ball convo....that's scary 🏃‍♂️🏃‍♂️🏃‍♂️🏃‍♂️I’m gonna write a song called Up Before The Sun in Phoenix. I need a Devin Booker feature.@KobeAnnobil Aswear

I mean...just a few months ago you kept telling us the Phoenix Suns were going to win the NBA title and become the next dynasty.11/18/20 – W/the 11th pick in the Covid-delayed #NBA Draft, the Phoenix #Suns selected 20-year-old PF Jalen "Stix" Smith out of Maryland 10th overall. Smith avg'd 15.5p/10.5r/2.2b, while shooting 53.8% from the field and 36.8% from 3. USA Today rated the pick worst. #ValleyProud https://t.co/UYk5WHr4dOPhoenix Suns’ success in clutch continues for 10th victory in a row - Arizona Sports

He says U believes the owner will be forced to sell the team 

Because they have emails on the guy saying N 

Also the black player told me 
He doesn't believe the owner is racist either 

Interesting how that worksShould I go to Senayan Park to get a vintage Phoenix Suns/Seattle Supersonics hat?It’s crazy watching Bol Bol… I’m old enough to remember when Manute Bol hit 6 3s against the Phoenix Suns and Charles Barkley laughing at him 😂 Good timesCivil Rights Icon Honored by Community Groups, Phoenix Suns During Game https://t.co/4j011qg1kW via @69News @BNCNews @BlackPressUSAFrom “#Witch cards of the Sun &amp; the Moon with phoenix &amp; dragon”

Andre Drummond was the 1st Unit Center, not Anthony Davis. Patience is a virtue.Everyone at Phoenix Lights once the sun sets. https://t.co/2iUbWZKTVwTo hell with traditional power rankings.
