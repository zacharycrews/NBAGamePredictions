The Cavaliers are [...] offering their 2022 first-round pick [...] for the best combo guard they can get. That might be Eric Gordon of the Houston Rockets or Caris LeVert of the Indiana Pacers. Ricky Rubio is expected to represent the outgoing salary. #Rockets https://t.co/8p8nuUrAQo@ramon_rican Warriors never humbled the Rockets, btw.

https://t.co/Cg09wXuZjZ@TravLyleCzech hilarious quote extract, because in Iko's last column he wrote "Barring an offer that simply can’t be ignored, it’s becoming more likely that Gordon remains in Houston past the deadline." don't think Danny has any intel, just doing the "what rockets should do" side of things@Nate_Dogg05 Not a Houston sports fan. Was old enough to follow the mariners before moving from Seattle so when I got to TX I was bitter towards them all. Eventually T-Mac &amp; Yao got me into the Rockets a bit but nothing die hard.I just remembered what this @Lakers team looks like. Remember Houston Rockets with super team of Drexler, Pippen, Hakeem and Barkley. Bunch of superstars beyond their prime looking for a chip. LeBron, AD, Russ, Melo, Dwight. Didn't work then, won't work now. #NBA @stephenasmithGoing to the @warriors vs. @HoustonRockets game tonight.
