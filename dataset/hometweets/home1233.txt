Nine seasons yet @kevinarnovitz, a basketball reporter, is still calling them the Hornets in The Lowe Post podcast. 🤷🏻‍♂️.@MattCHouston and I are in New Orleans getting ready for the Spurs/Pelicans game tomorrow. If any Spurs fans are making the trip, let us know.

This is the first Pelicans/Hornets team that feels like a NEW ORLEANS team.

And that’s no disrespect to some of those prior teams i.e. 02-03, 07-08, 17-18. But this group seems to finally represent what we’ve been begging for since they got here. https://t.co/nivjTEIr8qZion Williamson - New Orleans Pelicans IN STOCK at https://t.co/ZvpgacCx5q
