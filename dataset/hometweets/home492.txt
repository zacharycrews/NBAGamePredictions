Crazy.@MikeBellATL @ATLHawks 'After Xmas' Trae can play? I wonder if Luka not playing and everyone knowing @TheTraeYoung IS THE @nyknicks Daddy and he would absolutely shine in that game.

In only two other seasons have they lost 8+ straight home games: in 2004–05 they lost 11 straight, and in 1980–81 they lost eight straight. #TrueToAtlantaLast Atlanta Hawks home game of 2021.

This year has been a hell of a ride covering the NBA. I’m glad Hawks fans get a special gift a few days after Christmas.
