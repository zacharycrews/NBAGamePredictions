Yeah Magic did it but there’s a huge wave of them in the past 10 or so years, plus he’s a big factor in small ball becoming prevalent since he had such success at PF in Miami, teams had to adopt the small ball to guard the Heat@JohnnyOpkis @MiamiHEAT @FTX_Official what happened with him and spo? i only saw the clip of him and haslem tbhFrom earlier --  Miami Heat sign Mychal Mulder, waive Kyle Guy.

Happy Birthday @Klow7 https://t.co/ppFWpDekKA@fred66746579 @NBA @Klow7 @MiamiHEAT casual1u: Heat-5.5 vs. Knicks

This has now gone up to 7.5 which I still believe they can cover. Miami is 16-8-1 ATS after a loss this season, 3rd best in the NBA. The Knicks have lost 6 straight games in Miami by an average margin of 13.1 points.

💭 Answering YOUR questions!

sponsored by @NBA2K_UKI@Notori6us I purposefully didn’t use major US sports teams such as Cowboys (anyone would take that. You kinda have to) or Lakers etc, to make it less skewed. I’ll admit tho, I had no idea Miami Heat were so cheap compared to the avg major market professional sports team@MiamiHEAT What doesn’t make sense to me is Goran signed a min contract with the Nets. He was at games before AS break. Why didn’t you sign him🤷‍♀️ Luka came to Miami meet him after the AS game and the next week he was on the Nets. Kinda weird for the Heat and the Mavs to pass him up.@Larryk520 Manchester United &amp; Real Madrid each worth around 4.1-4.3 billion USD.
Miami Heat 2.5 billion, LAC 3.2 billion.Tbh I’m taking Manchester United and then just hiring GM’s &amp; stuff to run the team.
If I took Miami Heat, I’d pull some MJ mistake and think I can be my own GM bc I think I’m a hoops expert.
ManU, they’d prob have me assassinated if they saw me googling “what position is Cavani?”You kids these days and your 2013–14 Miami Heat season, and your List of companies of MyanmarFriday night locks:

How did he get a coaching job for the Miami Heat?So what kind of person is like Butler?

LeBron had four Hall of Famer‘s on his team (including him) with the Miami Heat and they still lost two of four to inferior talent in the Spurs and Mavs on the other side.
