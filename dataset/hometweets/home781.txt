Chris Finch decided to sub back in some of the starters.

Detroit then went on a 11-0 run over a 3:30 span.

Finch has truly proven to be a wizard, but his trust level with all-bench lineups is still a work in progress.The Wolves on Thursday had more trouble with the Pistons than they probably expected coming into the night, but they left Detroit with a 128-117 victory.

Saddiq Bey scored a tip-in layup to give the Pistons the lead at the buzzer. Detroit was down 10 with 4:56 left in the quarter but Frank Jackson and the bench really gave a jolt of energy there.

Bey 11 pts, 7 rebs
Jackson 9 pts (3-3 FG)We‚Äôre going to lose to the Detroit PistonsWolves waste that strong start as Detroit's reserves came into the game. The Pistons take a 32-31 lead into the second quarter. Not much defense from the Wolves once Vanderbilt and Beverley went to the bench.Pistons dominate the final few minutes of the first quarter, led by Saddiq Bey and Frank Jackson. Detroit takes a 32-31 lead into the second.

Triple-double watch for Bey already: 11p, 7r and 4a

Frank: 9 points@FS1 the @DetroitPistons are so Got Dang Garbage they got Fs1 showing Georgetown Basketball Losing by 20 !!!!!! 

Yet the consumers that pay for this service cannot watch their own States Professional Basketball team of the @NBA

Starting his favorite vets over the young guys. They aren't part of the future and will just hinder other player's development. I don't see the need to start the vets. It's just the Wolves.

It's mutually beneficial. Pistons climb standings and Miles heaves 20 shots per game being constantly fed by Cade.
