#NBA #parlay #statistics #invest@HistoryLivesDet @DetroitPistons @Bucks Terrible trade, obviously. But if they hadn’t made it, there’d likely be no @IsiahThomas , and Pistons history would look incredibly different.On this day, 1985: Rising an 11-game win streak, the Bucks hosted the Pistons. John Long and Bill Laimbeer led Detroit into OT with clutch shooting. Referee Blane Reichelt made a superb defensive play to give the Bucks one last chance, but the Pistons snuffed that out as well: https://t.co/95aMTiltmeOn this day in 1980:

https://t.co/D1qZZ74FXL@MotorCityHoops Put solid players around Cade, Grant and Bey and the Pistons are solid. 

Grant doesn’t deserve all the hate. He’s operated most of his Detroit career without Cade. Grant is a willing passer; if he stays he’s a good fit with his athleticism, outside shooting, and defense.In celebration of #BHM, the @DetroitPistons are partnering with the Rosa Parks Estate to provide free bus rides to Detroiters on  2/4 and 2/7  https://t.co/zHMGAAOb1H@jonmcreynolds @DetroitPistons That's pretty good!@celtics @DetroitPistons @NBCSBoston @985TheSportsHub Don’t worry about the All-Star game just go out there and put in that same hussle you guys been playing with and win this game. #Respectfully 🏁💚@tonydombrowski @DetroitPistons Please play tonight cade I’m gojng to the gameGOOD MORNING. ⭐️⭐️⭐️

#Pistons have entered the James Harden Sweepstakes. 

"Detroit wants to win- NOW. Troy Weaver is making calls- MANY calls. They were close to getting Harden last year and don't want to miss out again. Cunningham wants help; and might get some by February 10th." https://t.co/0BgvpuSu5V@eagle123kp @DetroitPistons @DetroitRedWings @LCArena_Detroit Wtf are you even talking about 😂@DetroitPistons @FWJackson15 @SaddiqBey @JeramiGrant Well, the 2nd half fell apart like it has been. Franklin tho🤭👏🏻 Bey w/ a double-double, Stew was getting some boards in the 1st half like flashback to last year-also a dub-dub, Frank or Hami should start over RmC-come on Case, stat that Hami has most steals since Dec or so😱🤯🤯Minnesota Timberwolves beat the Detroit Pistons, 128-117: Game thread replay https://t.co/SG8ze4kms4The Pistons called a TO at the 7:38 mark trailing 117-101.

Chris Finch decided to sub back in some of the starters.

Detroit then went on a 11-0 run over a 3:30 span.

Finch has truly proven to be a wizard, but his trust level with all-bench lineups is still a work in progress.The Wolves on Thursday had more trouble with the Pistons than they probably expected coming into the night, but they left Detroit with a 128-117 victory.

Saddiq Bey scored a tip-in layup to give the Pistons the lead at the buzzer. Detroit was down 10 with 4:56 left in the quarter but Frank Jackson and the bench really gave a jolt of energy there.

Bey 11 pts, 7 rebs
Jackson 9 pts (3-3 FG)We’re going to lose to the Detroit PistonsWolves waste that strong start as Detroit's reserves came into the game. The Pistons take a 32-31 lead into the second quarter. Not much defense from the Wolves once Vanderbilt and Beverley went to the bench.Pistons dominate the final few minutes of the first quarter, led by Saddiq Bey and Frank Jackson. Detroit takes a 32-31 lead into the second.

Triple-double watch for Bey already: 11p, 7r and 4a

Frank: 9 points@FS1 the @DetroitPistons are so Got Dang Garbage they got Fs1 showing Georgetown Basketball Losing by 20 !!!!!!

Ten of Detroit's 13 shots have come from behind the arc.

The queen Aaliyah@DetroitPistons @Kia Why isn't Hami Starting bro that doesn't make Sense. Casey has to go man. His lineups or adjustments don't make sense. Why would you Not Start Hami when we are RESTORING. Rodney is done here.Timeout Detroit with 8:50 left in the first quarter. They trail the #Wolves 9-2. 

#Pistons scored first but it’s been all Minnesota since.@DetroitPistons Frank and JGCasey with an early timeout. Pistons down 9-2 early. Detroit starts 1-6 from field.@DetroitPistons @Kia No Ham or Frank?Check out this listing I just added to my #Poshmark closet: Detroit Pistons Ben Wallace Jersey NBA Majestic  Red Back Dunk Print Youth 10/12. https://t.co/uYjtxVn6HA #shopmycloset @poshmarkapp@DetroitPistons Frank and JeramiWho are these #Pistons best friends wearing the same shoes tonight? ⤵️ https://t.co/hySQcYNN2E@woodwardsports @CadeCunningham_ @DetroitPistons @NBA @AshtonDaTrainer Just wait til the shots start falling more regularly. 🤯@DetroitPistons @Kia Here is one of the obvious reason why I don't wanna see Casey moving forward. Starting his favorite vets over the young guys. They aren't part of the future and will just hinder other player's development. I don't see the need to start the vets. It's just the Wolves.

It's mutually beneficial. Pistons climb standings and Miles heaves 20 shots per game being constantly fed by Cade. Would Charlotte match a max? 👀Getting ready for tonight's YUGE @ArizonaMBB game with some @DetroitPistons action and a @northcenterbrew's Bobby English ESB. https://t.co/e0AL7bBfk8@DetroitPistons @Kia sometimes I rlly think we’re tankingMinnesota Timberwolves vs Detroit Pistons | NBA Live Stream
