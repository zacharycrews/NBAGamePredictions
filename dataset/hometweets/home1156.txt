#Pistons #ThunderUp https://t.co/Ritnvg4SuqTonight's @HenryFordHealth injury/status report against the Oklahoma City Thunder: https://t.co/PWC2ZqZwASIf former Oklahoma City Thunder star Kevin Durant had his way, the team would have one more jersey hanging from the rafters of the Paycom Center.
https://t.co/R5QnVhkvFRAs reported, Jaylen Hoard has been signed to a 10-day hardship exception by the Oklahoma City Thunder.

Hoard was inactive in yesterday’s Blue-Wolves game while Jahmi’us Ramsey has been out the last two games for OKC. No status on a potential injury.

Curious if Ramsey follows.Washington Wizards - Dallas Mavericks
