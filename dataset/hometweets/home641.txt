He lead the Bad Boyz to 2 Championships. One of the Most Competitive Players to ever play the Game. Played hard &amp; Smart. Exceptional in his Skills and Court IQ. Great shooter, scorer, passer &amp; defender.

What a hilarious team.Arguably, the Phoenix Suns biggest need come trade deadline is a backup primary ball handling Point Guard. With Elfrid Payton &amp; Abdel Nader on the trade block/in the trade rumor mill, rumors now surface on the Phoenix Suns trading for Cory Joseph of the Detroit Pistons. @Gambo987@LiteralLebron Thats a Very Detroit Pistons thing to say!!!!!!Congratulations to Michigankevin who moved up 1 spot to take #2 on the Detroit Pistons team leaderboard.

A Punk, he never picked on anybody his own Size@DetroitPistons @JeramiGrant The Sheer Number of Teams trying to Steal Jemari Grant should show the Detroit Pistons how valuable J.G. Is? It should be a Clear Red Flag the this potentially one of the Cornerstone Building blocks for Detroit’s next Championships Teams. PLEASE BE SMART. Don’t trade Jemari Grant@DetroitPistons @JeramiGrant Trade somebody else. Why in the Hell would you Trade your Best Player? The only Piston who’s Averaging 20 PPG a Game. Jemari Checked LeBron in a Playoff Game that his Team Won. Because Jemari Grant is a Very Good Defensive Player!
