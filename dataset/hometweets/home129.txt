#GamblingTwitter #NHL #SportsGambling #NBA75 #goldenstatewarriors #LAClippers@MegaZane5 I remember this exact shot, Golden State was down 4 and he hit a 3 pointer to bring them within 1, Warriors foul Pelicans and they hit both freethrows so they’re down 3. Curry misses a three and gets it kicked right back out and splashes it for the tie 🤩I don't think anyone who has followed the NBA is particularly surprised. There have been murmurs of a toxic culture and while we never got too many specifics, people were aware that something was going on. #nba #phoenixsuns #suns #goldenstatewarriors #draymondgreen https://t.co/TrZ8Vx3HjqGolden State Warriors: Stephen Curry Highlights Games vs Thunder, Kings,... https://t.co/mnqGzTy0GW via @YouTubeWestern Conference team -- the Golden State Warriors -- is also surging with a 5-1 record entering Week 3.
