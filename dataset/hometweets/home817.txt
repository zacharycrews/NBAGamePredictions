@Monique68633105 https://t.co/xVBfOcgPH7The Sacramento Kings and the Indiana Pacers shock the #NBA world with this blockbuster deal involving Domantas Sabonis and Tyrese Haliburton. Our Donald Stewart @DStewart267 looks at the effects this will have on both teams. 

https://t.co/hviM0MkWmb@SacramentoKings @MattressFirm How could you@coachsolis12 @buddyhield @SacramentoKings @Pacers Yeah, telling the boys @I_CU_boy and @VonMiller were no longer Broncos was terrible. We feel ya Maddux and Jaden.One thing was made damn sure today: the Sacramento Kings have way more fans than the Brooklyn Nets. 
#SacramentoProud #BrooklynTogether 🤣@SacramentoKings @Vivek as a life long kings fan, this is beyond ridiculous. It’s year after year of disappointment. We had a play this whole city absolutely loved and a city the player loved and then you trade him. This is why we are the laughing stock of the nba. Shit like this@Pat_Benson_Jr Thanks @SacramentoKings@cDUBB_03 @SacramentoKings I remember. I was watching that Dallas game.Grading the Kings-Pacers trade for Domantas Sabonis and Tyrese Haliburton 

Let’s grade the massive deal between the Kings and Pacers.

The Indiana Pacers and Sacramento Kings were two teams in desperate need of a shake-up. About 48 hours before the 2022… https://t.co/e4kJc2dOtjNBA Trade deadlines fast approaching, Sacramento Kings making deals, ASU W/M Basketball updates following crazy home stretch, and much much more! 

COMING UP ON https://t.co/Nagui7fMsF 

@nicole_pinter6 &amp; @gabbyducharme break it ALL down! 💪 @BlazeRadioASU @Blaze_Sports https://t.co/YJazjzcajTNot too many NBA players say they want to be in Sacramento, acknowledge the past mistakes the organization has made, and on top of that, say they want to lead the charge transitioning the franchise into a winning culture. 

Tyrese Haliburton did all of that and Kings traded him.@JaqenJordan @Champ_Lion @balldontstop The Sacramento Kings 😭@miiman13_ @SacramentoKings @MattressFirm Kings probably traded it@DegenSwings Not the answer you’re looking for but the Sacramento Kings subreddit@shootwithscoot @SacramentoKings That’s how he got here!I don't understand why the @SacramentoKings are getting so much heat for that trade...they weren't doing anything with D Fox and Haliburton. They got back an established star with Sabonis. Good trade KingsWow the @SacramentoKings continue to show that they are a joke of a franchise. #NBATradeDeadlinethe Sacramento Kings after trading Tyrese Haliburton for no good reason: https://t.co/E7oKbEp33PI wanna work for the @SacramentoKings front office.

 #FranchisePlayer #MuchLove #MadRespect Hard pill to swallow, but go kill it for the Pacers!@statmuse @SacramentoKings Is that Kevin Martin?@espn @wojespn There cannot be a tougher team to be a fan of than the Sacramento Kings, right?The Sacramento Kings have a special place in my heart, but I’m going to need the Timberwolves to win by a combined 50 in this series https://t.co/0FqbWHeasrCompletely understand what the @trailblazers did to their roster....

I'm still trying to figure out if the @SacramentoKings had a child running the front office today or not..@hooperm1ke3 @ishhh03 @SacramentoKings It was a terrible trade@RubyTuesday916 @CarmichaelDave Dave on every Sacramento kings move https://t.co/ca9K0Vq5Nx@IanRGillespie Im still trying to make sense of that one and especially the Haliburton one. The Sacramento Kings strike again.I'm done with the Sacramento Kings. https://t.co/t9yW2qy0nKI'm happy Fox gets this opportunity in Sacramento. 

People value or put more stock into a person's feelings or emotions when they are more prominently/outwardly displayed. 

Those who believe Tyrese cares(d) more than Fox about the Kings...are truly suckers for personality@SacramentoKings horrible trade today guys.Hey @SacramentoKings who left the intern in charge of who to trade? The @Pacers got a steal with @TyHaliburton22.A live look at Sacramento King reddit https://t.co/7sqDxWOkdsPoor little guy!! I thought Jaden was going to take it hard about @buddyhield leaving.

Haliburton actually wanted to be there!!

- https://t.co/8r1oIToEEL@The_Biz_13 @bennnyboom @Timberwolves @SacramentoKings Oh I know. I would’ve kept Hali. Very good, young, two way point guard.@joshuamcsee @daveandrade32 @SacramentoKings I don't watch the CHA play regularly. But all I ever hear is that you need a starting center so I thought trading a starting center for an underperforming big and rookie who hasn't gotten consistent minutes might be close to something that gets the job done.Exactly what I was saying @SacramentoKings y’all dumb asf https://t.co/zT01N09fWsSacramento Kings fans after another horrible trade deadline https://t.co/LI6D623apNWelp Kings fans… we all wanted a trade. Hard to trade a guy in Tyrese who openly expressed his love for the city of Sacramento. Guys like that don’t come around often. I hope it works out for the Kings.Kings fans have every right to feel anxious about any move. Fans place a lot of hope, faith, &amp; trust in this team. New arena but the same lousy culture. Sacramento never lacked loyalty, so let's continue to rock #SacramentoProudMay pinoy fan ba yung Sacramento Kings? 🤔If anyone actually understand what the Sacramento Kings are doing (or have been doing since the infamous "Stauskas? Stauskas? Stauskas?" moment) please unleash the knowledge here@JXDFNS Sacramento KingsLook at these fuckin nerds 😂😂 bruh give me a job @SacramentoKings https://t.co/kO1JUrvxZ7Somebody wake me up From this horrible dream and bullshit the @SacramentoKings just did with this trade...@TyHaliburton22 I have been a @SacramentoKings fan since I was born. You have been one of the few bright spots of the last decade. I will always be a fan of yours, but right now I don’t think I have the heart to keep watching the @NBA . Good luck in Indiana.After taking some time to think about the Kings trade, I have come to the conclusion that by them trading Tyrese Haliburton it's time to move the team to Seattle under new ownership. Sacramento has had enough@SacramentoKings @MattressFirm Kings pls don’t take this trade wait till next season and make a better deal. #halliburton #buddy keeperday 1 of asking the @SacramentoKings for a free @Dsabonis11 jerseyThe Sacramento Kings really chose Fox over Haliburton… 😬 https://t.co/G90BuKKGgc@TakeThatCDC @imalillygirl33 @Unwise_Trousers @DarkEntree @TinFoilAwards @Progressive_RN @kgopinion @72MichiganPapa @JustaCoinToss @_AbolishPolice_ @Balancement @laflemm12 @ahf77118198 @SandraHelena39 @dovesandletters @TZidanista @Zenfucius @SacramentoKings @goonerdave66 @ChristineEliaz @montecoman @gabriel67891734 @larkin_robertl @HopeInTheUSA @Roan_onHorton @a9ymous @The_Acumen @blackintheempir @donotwriteback1 @SJonesWasTaken @glowingcanary @katalin_pota @debpresente @KCdirector @MariaSvetlakov @MikhailUC @hairygit @LucyTreadwell01 @VivetVeritate @HedwigOwlett @EmmaDubya @undrcvrbrothr @anthonyzenkus @DenyThemEssence @TimOnTheTractor @mrs_socialista @DoctorFishbones @Jaybefaunt @ChristosArgyrop @RoKaras1 Cthulhu in context, emerging from the Green Wood.Oh the @SacramentoKings picked up Jeremy Lamb???

#NBASacramento Kings traded Tristan Thompson to the Indiana Pacers today.

Seems even more likely now that the Pacers who are retooling are going to buyout Tristan Thompson. 

No arguments really needed.

Sacramento kings once again proving they are the worst run franchise in the NBA.

The Indiana Pacers just got a new franchise player. #NBATradeDeadline #NBA https://t.co/g6FyrMIQiNThe worst 1st quarter beatdown to my recollection was the showtime Lakers running up a 40-4 lead on the Sacramento Kings.

That could be in danger right now.What the f*** are the Sacramento Kings doing!!!! It doesnt make sense....Why do we continue to let the Sacramento Kings be a thing…My husband is loving this #Nets .

⌚21:10 Hrs https://t.co/cPw4l8YOQ4Exactly, the Sacramento Kings are 15 games under .500. This isn't working

It does hurt, but Mitchell looks good and Haliburton was also McNair's pick. Another way to look at it is he successfully turned the 12th pick in to an All Star and dumped Buddy Hields salary with it https://t.co/3LaZr8Tu6l@rachelnmarcus Yep, and it's 28-2 now. It's like the reverse of that SNL skit, if you saw it, where they had the Nets decimating the replacement-player-filled Sacramento Kings.@statmuse @SacramentoKings Yall couldnt even get a 1st rder for him

Just fringe all star sabonisTherapy time ☺️ I hate the #sacramentokings https://t.co/v1ihCky72OAlso the @SacramentoKings are really really really dumb for moving Tyrese@SacramentoKings Team player, eye for the floor, desire to win… and you dump him for a rental forward who’s prone to injury and a defensive liability. It’s like you actually want to lose.@maxeyszn @SacramentoKings @XiNevett Couldn’t even shut down joseph for the one on one game winning shot@DeanScorpion_ Please reference where Sacramento announced a mandate similar to the Bay Area.

Hal is a stud and will have a great career but we have an all-star in his prime now. How can you not be excited about that as a fan?I'd like to officially point out that the "Bringing Buddy off the Bench" Experiment was a huge failure and in turn cost you a potential franchise player in Tyrese.  @mmcnair @SacramentoKings@Rankycurt0 He went to Sacramento Kings@NifMuhammad @SacramentoKings fans I feel ya. I felt exactly as disappointed as you do while @warriors were owned by a bad ownership group.The Sacramento Kings and Indiana Pacers agree to a six player trade today.

the GOAT - Oscar Robertson - The Big OThe newest member of the Sacramento Kings: Domantas Sabonis  https://t.co/UPXXSNmp8q https://t.co/2L0GNlmJwfJesus 🤦‍♂️ Kings gonna kings @SacramentoKings https://t.co/RKcUO34vW0 https://t.co/XwXQpWtanXThoughts on Kings acquiring Sabonis 👇
 
Pairing De’Aaron Fox with Sabonis makes the Kings better. However, Sabonis and Fox aren’t suited to be a #1 guy on a playoff team. Now, 2 of your top assets (Haliburton + Hield) are Pacers…So how does Sacramento acquire this… (1/2) https://t.co/WXAUJt3vnxWhen the @SacramentoKings make a trade https://t.co/6koqRFEF6TNOOOOOOOO! Come on @hornets we need a star center for rebounds and defense… and less turnovers wouldn’t hurt 😭
And that’s all the @SacramentoKings gave up!? 😤😭 https://t.co/aNg78TBceHSmh but Sacramento doesn’t understand  that’s not enough to win games. Didn’t Dfox do the same “embrace Sacramento” how’s that worked out ? Tyrese is a great player with great potential but that’s all the kings have had. Have to give up something to get something. Sabonis is it. https://t.co/irNK3V8y9HReports: @Pacers trade @Dsabonis11 to @SacramentoKings in 6-player deal
https://t.co/MSYlt9a5hNNBA insider Jordan Schultz confirmed that is the case, noting it is now “highly unlikely” that the Kings will trade Fox before the Thursday deadline. Sacramento sees their speedy guard as a future All-Star who can be the face of the franchise for a long time@Kris__Jensen @trvsknsly @SacramentoKings @BringBackSonics What if the kings come to Seattle tho..@SacramentoKings @CacheCreekCR Good trade for Kings. They acquire an all star center while unloading Buddy Hields bad contract and bad attitudeI LEGIT STARTED WATCHING SACRAMENTO KINGS BASKETBALL GAMES JUST TO WATCH HALIBURTON PLAY THIS KID WAS THE BEST PLAYER ON THAT TEAM THEY DONT EVEN KNOW HIS CEILING YET AND THEY TRADE HIM FOR SABONIS.

I still like the Kings. They are my 2nd favorite team in the league. The ultimate underdogs.

 like Sabonis. I just don’t see how, or why this was the trade.

I truly hope it works out for them.

(We do talk about other things - music, books, food, etc - but the thread, known as The Thread From Hell - is mostly about vaccines.)Life could be worse. I could be a Sacramento kings fanLOVE Sabonis, but @SacramentoKings failed in this trade by shipping Haliburton and keeping Fox

yes, Buddy needed to go, Lamb and Holiday are backups
but ...
Holmes and Sabonis are terrible together
another trade is needed to make this be anything but a F-grade for KingsBetter, more stable franchise right now? Sacramento Kings or Jacksonville Jaguars?

#TyreseHaliburton trade.Couldn’t imagine being a Sacramento Kings fan. They suffer so much.

They don't need to be in Sacramento anymore. I'm at a point where I'd much rather see Seattle have fun and be a part of the NBA.

#nba #nbanews #nbatrade https://t.co/u4G0mQfcfzThe Sacramento Kings are a better basketball team now than they were yesterday.I see it less as giving up on Haliburton and more of a longterm investment in Davion Mitchell.

I would have traded Fox and Mitchell before Haliburton. Haliburton is rising to becoming an efficient star player soon. Watch out for him.@SacramentoKings trading away another gel guy huh..? Gonna be the same situation when we traded Shump but 100000% worse.

Was sure Fox would be the guy they movedAbsolutely DISGUSTED with the @SacramentoKings for what they just did. Top 3 ROTY last year and absolute stud this year. So you trade away half of the duo that could have turned into a Lillard/McCollum, Curry/Thompson, Nash/Stoudamire, Billups/Hamilton type PG/SG team w/Hield?..L@cal_host Sacramento Kings*Sacramento Kings Front Office does Running Man*@AnotherSFwriter @MarcJSpears Yeah, he was just a guy who was the first overall pick, the rookie of the year, and an all star the previous. Also, if you could read I’ve only spoken about his MVP talent prior to going to Sacramento.

For One - they did this for a "win now" move, but it doesn't make them much better

Secondly - what GM would think, "this is the best move for our franchise" ?

Not sure what Sac Town is doing here man

Good trade, @SacramentoKings #SacramentoProud@CarmichaelDave Sabonis, dead straight now a top 15 Sacramento Era kings ever. There's no arguing that. People love the player here and not exactly the game they play.Everyday going in on the @SacramentoKings , but I think things will work out this time.
They have a star in the frontcourt and backcourt now.
Plus they got the draft and free agency.
Haliburton and the Kings will be fine.

You may end up being right, but this trade does not excite me one bit ... and I believe we will miss Haliburton greatly.  

I would have rather lost Fox in that thing.Pretty crazy that the #Cavs are back to this point.

The fanbase artwork is brilliant. 😂 https://t.co/LOCNxbRAEKIn my 18 years as a @SacramentoKings fan, I don't think I've ever had such a bittersweet moment as this. 

Haliburton has been such a big part of Kings culture and it is going to be HEARTBREAKING to see him in a Pacers jersey. 

But on the flip side... Domantas fuckin' Sabonis.Since you guys are giving away players let's get it done @SacramentoKings https://t.co/ISCwJDkMGUThe @SacramentoKings didn’t deserve Halliburton anywaysWhat was that @SacramentoKings ?Sacramento Kings very stupid Tyrese Haliburton is already very good player and is just going to continue to better Sabonis also very good but yh that feels like a bad mistakeIt seems to me that the Sacramento Kings might be the most forgotten NBA team, and is only thought about when they make the most peculiar moves possible.@Austin_king52 @tuckclarry @jordanbilal2 @TheZagaholic Yeah no, history would tell us that literally everything the Kings do is bad. I get defending the Zags, but I draw the line where that means defending Sacramento's front office 😂😂😂😂I don't think a single team in all of sports is in a sadder position than the Sacramento Kings.@SacramentoKings please just explain to me how this makes your team better ??. Beyond confusedTyrese Haliburton: I wanna be part of the solution for the Sacramento Kings and will do whatever it takes to win. That is a promise.

#Kings #Sacramento@SacramentoKings @CacheCreekCR Down horrendous@FCartoscelli3 Just as with today's trade Kings Gans have difficulty understanding why the move was made and what they are getting. I loved Mitch. I love Hali. However, Webber turned Sacramento into a power house.

∙ 15.9 PTS, 9.7 AST, 1.7 STL

∙ Career-high 38 points at Philly
∙ Career-high 17 assists in Kings finaleThe @SacramentoKings are down bad😂😂😂5. So, the Kings get: 
Fox, Sabonis, better depth, and keep their potentially top 5 pick in a draft with plenty of stud guards. 

Maybe I'm crazy but this trade may turn out really good for Sacramento. 

Of course, that all depends on how you view Fox as your best player.@SacramentoKings got the better end of the trade.

Later traded him for a young PF (C-Webb) which led to the best stretch of the Sacramento era - 8 consec playoff apps and WCF (and poss Finals if not for Dick Bavetta)@imalillygirl33 @TakeThatCDC @Progressive_RN @kgopinion @72MichiganPapa @JustaCoinToss @_AbolishPolice_ @Balancement @laflemm12 @ahf77118198 @SandraHelena39 @dovesandletters @TZidanista @Zenfucius @SacramentoKings @goonerdave66 @ChristineEliaz @montecoman @gabriel67891734 @larkin_robertl @HopeInTheUSA @Roan_onHorton @DarkEntree @a9ymous @The_Acumen @blackintheempir @donotwriteback1 @SJonesWasTaken @glowingcanary @katalin_pota @debpresente @KCdirector @MariaSvetlakov @MikhailUC @hairygit @LucyTreadwell01 @VivetVeritate @HedwigOwlett @EmmaDubya @undrcvrbrothr @anthonyzenkus @DenyThemEssence @TimOnTheTractor @mrs_socialista @DoctorFishbones @Jaybefaunt @ChristosArgyrop @WendyOrent @TinFoilAwards @RoKaras1 Descartes make me so angry.

Something had to changeThe Sacramento Kings deserve to lose all the games after that trade.Sacramento's roster is still VERY unbalanced.

Fox/Mitchell
Holiday/Lamb/Ramsey
Barnes/TD/King/Woodard
Sabonis/Bagley/Harkless/Metu
Holmes/Jones/Len/Queta

Bagley has still yet to be moved, and Holmes feels like the other odd man out.Bro, why? @SacramentoKings@ethan_suleski @SacramentoKings @CacheCreekCR I don’t think giving away heild and hali for lamb and holiday just to get a big had them boys thinking we’re playoff bound (I hope not)I’ve been to Sacramento and Nashville is a better city, let us get the kingsThank you, @TyHaliburton22, for the hard work, dedication, and effort you put forth as a Sacramento King.

No Sacramento mandate.The @SacramentoKings are the dumbest organization in professional basketball.  #tradedeadlineAny @SacramentoKings fans that are sick about this trade can blame Richaun Holmes, Harkless, Bagley, etc for it. 

If you weren’t dead last in the league in points in the paint given up and rebounds to centers, you wouldn’t have needed to trade for Sabonis. Sad franchise!@JeffTelgenhoff @SacramentoKings It’s tough. But Hali did fall into our laps. I think Fox’s ceiling is ultimately higher which is why I can stomach it. And hey, we finally got an all star!!@Cj68625476 @SacramentoKings @CacheCreekCR We basically had baby shaq and ol boy didn’t gaf we can get god himself at this point and STILL trade him awayThe Sacramento kings had one job!

Yes, it's tough losing Tyrese. Love him.  But to get an All Star, we had to give up something. I don't hate this trade as much as Kings universe appears to.@shiken_joy @SacramentoKings @CacheCreekCR Nah I’m officially done keeping up with the kings I’ll only be a fan on 2k where I’m gm the only star we haven’t traded after finding talent is fox 😐@SacramentoKings you traded Tyrese Haliburton???
Fire EVERYBODY 🔥!!!
I'm SOOO SICK of our front office. 
We OFFICIALLY suck again!!@@JVGsCivic @alanhahn Idk if haliburton would’ve been as good if he was on the Knicks in his first 2 years instead of the kings,in Sacramento he actually has the opportunity to play knowing thibs he’d be behind kemba rnAdam Silver is trading Sacramento Kings for Seattle Supersonics, sources tell. https://t.co/YuDa9eZDruWhy do the Sacramento Kings hate loyalty?Typical Sacramento Kings head scratcher. They keep Fox with a limited upside instead of Haliburton who’s younger with a huge upside.  Pairing Sabonis with Haliburton instead of Fox would’ve been much smarter long term in my opinion.@whatthefrickdan @SacramentoKings Exactly. Sabonis under contract for 2 and a half years. I love the trade. I also hate it because Halliburton has a huge ceiling I think.the Sacramento kings Reddit is in absolute shambles good lord@MarcosBreton @SacramentoKings Not a stand-out leadership move, now was it? 

🤔🤦🏻‍♀️😥@SacramentoKings @CacheCreekCR Kings fans, if there are even any left. I’m here for you, but there’s absolutely no hope left for y’all.@ItzConz But the Kings are the Kings. They had a young core of Boogie and Isaiah Thomas and won 20 games! Any other franchise can prepare for the future, Sacramento just need to get out of the lottery for the first time in almost 2 decades@TheHoopCentral How many times can one be disappointed before they decide to stop being a @SacramentoKings fan?  I was so excited to see a team built around an incredible, young talent like @TyHaliburton22I was today years old when I found out that even a sports team like the Sacramento Kings have a reddit page. https://t.co/fxpc5bSJXzThe @SacramentoKings are finally make some moves.  We all love Hali but we are in desperate need of a big man. We still have some good guards so I’m ok with this trade.  We still need a couple of more key players so I’m hoping for a couple of more big trades.@SacramentoKings And Now you trade Tyrese Haliburton for this??? KINGS SUCK AGAIN!!! https://t.co/PTU4TXQDwF@grayson_heiser4 @SacramentoKings Sabonis is better than hali but the Pacers got 2 borderline starters for 2 guys who are outta the league by 2024 😂😂🤦🏻‍♂️ u rightBad move getting rid of Haliburton @SacramentoKingsEveryone to the Sacramento Kings right now because of the trade : https://t.co/uifddclwtqWhat are the Sacramento Basketball Kings doing?Alexander-Walker being moved along seemed like a strange move after the Pels showed us he was part of future plans.

Apologies to the loyal Kings fans, but it's time to have that franchise cease to exist, so they can no longer put their supporters in perpetual agony.

Trade Haliburton???@espn @wojespn @SacramentoKings are a joke. Their management is clueless@grayson_heiser4 @SacramentoKings But sabonis and hali are a much better fit I agree there. Fox fastest PG in the league and sabonis slow asf 😂😂@mr_jasonjones We are upset because we lost talent that wanted to stay with the @SacramentoKings and fix the culture...not even a handful of talented basketball players in the world who care like @TyHaliburton22 does about this townAlright, who is going to be the bad guy to tell @jaden_solis9 that his favorite basketball player has moved to Indiana 😭😭.. Thanks for being amazing @buddyhield and thanks for making @SacramentoKings basketball fun! You'll be missed!!@_marinadrab Why Haliburton? He was basically the only productive King.

Your enthusiasm both on the court and in our community will be missed. #thankyou@feyderade @SacramentoKings He was springy at practice! I think fox had so much pressure as the only guy on the kings who could score. Hali would take 4 shots when they played together and buddy couldn’t hit anything. Defenses only needed to focus on Fox which is why I think he regressed.Did @SacramentoKings won that trade?@KTCarguy @MarcosBreton @SacramentoKings Nobody wants to give up an a AllStar for our trash. They wanted Fox AND Hali, for Simmons. Gotta give something valuable to get something unfortunately...@DBGyt_ But for how long is sabonis gonna want to stay in Sacramento? Like if the Kings don't build a good team in the summer there's a problem@ImClique_ Bout to be a 10 second video as there is no hope for the Sacramento KingsIf #SacramentoKings would’ve approached me w/that trade I’d be like the #NickiMinaj verse…”Hol’up Shorty, Hol’up Bitch…”🤣 Wild ass Trade! #NBA #DoWeHaveAProblem https://t.co/c5TGkPNzoC@_AdamJohnson_ @SacramentoKings Haha, amazing, ain’t it?Sacramento Kings management is terrible.

In the past, I'd be super pissed.

But as a Kings fan, I've somewhat grown numb to these terrible decisions they always make.@NBA_NewYork @SacramentoKings WTF if Knicks brain trust didn't try to move heaven and Randle to get him.@switztweets @statmuse @SacramentoKings Yea but not sayin Tyrese is bad or anything like that, but Sabonis is the better player and Fox is a more steady choice at guard rn

The trade isn’t that bad imo?? Am I wrong?@ikanator Sabonis is extremely underrated but the Kings should’ve never given up Hali. Would’ve rather seen Fox back to Indy and pair Hali and Sabonis in Sacramento@HannahMuldavin @SacramentoKings Devastating@StephBoyarthree @TomerAzarly If I'm rebuilding, which Indy clearly is, I'd rather rebuild around Halliburton than Sabonis. And the fact that Sacramento paid Hield $22 per year says all you need to know about the King's and their front office. Not to mention that they drafted Bagley ahead of Doncic and TreyFuck you @SacramentoKings ! Honestly so fucking stupid. Give up our best guy for Sabonis. Absolute bone head move. Fuck this franchise.They gotta rename them to The Sacramento TanKings at this point.  

At this point you gotta have someone check the paperwork and make sure The Sacramento Kings dont get extra money to lose games.Whenever anyone makes fun of you for not respecting the professional basketball expertise of NBA front offices, just remember that the Sacramento Kings haven't made the playoffs since 2006. There's about a 50% chance of making the playoffs straight up.@FCartoscelli3 Only works if they sign him long term...@TyHaliburton22 wasn't going anywhere...he wanted to stay a get this organized fixed...not even a handful of basketball players on this earth who care that much about the @SacramentoKings

Only upside is that @TyHaliburton22 doesn't have to waste his talent with such a dysfunctional franchise...that guy is a star in the making. Always gonna wonder what he and @swipathefox might have accomplished as a duo. Now #FreeSwipa!@SchoeferTyler @SacramentoKings this entire thing hinges on Fox getting back to his 2020-2021 ways… whether he can do that remains to be seen. 😓

I’m curious how his ankle is feeling now 😂@tabrizzle @SacramentoKings Kings have a proven system brother. Just like the Spurs, the players may change from year to year but this well-oiled machine still generates consistent results. https://t.co/PZBpvOgpgL@rheidrick24 @SacramentoKings Yeah Rick SO FUNNY 😒The Sacramento kings gone forever be a  poverty franchise😭😭@NicolasHorning @SacramentoKings Sabonis gonna turn this thing aroundOne more thing the @SacramentoKings did… they made it that much harder on the @Lakers to get the 8th seed. Can you imagine this lakers team missing the playoffs with all of their hype 😂 #ValleyProudI still can’t believe the @pacers figured out a way to get Haliburton and Buddy Hield! Did the Pacers just finesse the @SacramentoKings? https://t.co/KaiOwErlWpDrug test everyone in the Sacramento Kings facility immediately@bretthuff22 I'm curious, what excites you about Sabonis' fit in Sacramento? The Kings have no offensive system whatsoever &amp; their defense is atrocious. You can't just throw talent on the floor &amp; expect it to result in wins. Sabonis makes no difference if the Kings don't have an identity@TyHaliburton22 ...gut punch...hate losing a quality individual like ur self who wanted to be a leader here &amp; change the culture for the @SacramentoKings ...it's moves like this that set us back for yrs...appreciate ur want...good luck!How have the #sacramentokings messed up yet again. All I want at this point is for them to be enjoyable to follow and every time things start to look up they mess it up again 😔Too bad for the @SacramentoKings to leave Tyrese Haliburton and keep Fox
@BleacherReport @BR_NBA @ESPNNBA @TheNBACentral @NBAonTNTThe Indiana Pacers made fools of the Sacramento Kings in the Domantas Sabonis trade sweepstakes. They've also set themselves up for years of contention with a brilliant stroke of genius.

Gotta moral dilemma... plan to cheer for the Kings but wear a new @TyHaliburton22 Pacers jersey while wearing an OU hat for @buddyhield...gulpThere’s not a single possible way I can spin this to make the Kings look smart here. Not a single way. Enjoy the play-in tournament Sacramento!
Beautiful trade for the Pacers, now let’s see what they can get back for Turner #nba #Pacers https://t.co/tEtrPQLxDgWhat are the @SacramentoKings doing exactly? So confused 🤣@statmuse @SacramentoKings So the Kings just moved a future multi-year all-star to lose in the play-in tournament?Can @JohnLynch49ers head over to Sacramento and help the @SacramentoKings figure out how to build a team… PLEASE!! Kings fans everywhere are begging you 🙏🏻 #ThisIsGettingOld@jesterthaclown @JJetsSZNN @yrnevan_ @SacramentoKings @CacheCreekCR Thats tough'I really like this for Sacramento, Sabonis can go there and be a stabilizing factor' 👑

You will be sorely missed but at least you are free from this train wreck.The Sabonis Pacers / Kings trade strikes me as Sacramento asked for Sabonis, and Indy was like "only if you like throw in Buddy Hield AND Tyrese Haliburton!" 

And Sacramento was like "Bet."

Always remember that no matter how bad it ever gets, your franchise could be the Sacramento Kings, who just traded the sole member of their team that one would NOT want to trade: Tyrese Haliburton. 🤡 🏀🤔😂I’m weak asf they have an emergency Sacramento kings space on here rn 🤣🤣🤣Why did y’all trade Hali? Fools @SacramentoKingssacramento kings management is my great enemySabonis is definitely leaving. What the fuck was this trade Sacramento Kings???@NBAAllStar @SacramentoKings @TyHaliburton22 Aged poorlyI've heard @SacramentoKings just traded @TyHaliburton22 well, sorry Kings GM, this decision will definitely come back to hunt you! https://t.co/Wp4CKTujcE@NicoleTP The Sacramento Kings is the most terribly managed franchise in history@SacramentoKings since y’all making bad choices, take Russ off our hands will yaOnly @SacramentoKings management could do a deal like this. Sabonis will be gone in 2 years and the Kings will still be in the same position. It’s really hard to be a kings fan. Worse winning percentage for any North American professional team in the past 20 years. Good luck HaliI feel bad for @SacramentoKings fans right now.15 terrible years apparently wasn’t enough for @SacramentoKings as they continue to set the stage for 15 more.

Today’s trade brought to us by the worst franchise and controlling owner in professional sports.

Well done guys!The Sacramento Kings are the most  I'll relevant term in all of North America sports.  Not the Texas Rangers not the Ottawa Senators not even the Jacksonville Jaguars! https://t.co/OqhGKIFgKCSacramento kings need consistency and Sabonis looks to bring that.

I like @Dsabonis11 … a lot… but what a weird move.@mmcnair @sacramentokings You gotta be kidding. The one guy you couldn’t trade. This is terrible.@MarcosBreton “We” Kings fans get a 25 year old 2 time All Star, a virtual 20 and 10 player who is clearly the best player in the trade, for a player with unlimited potential who loves Sacramento. And we are still not happy.

I will miss Tyrese, I want to get better.

Secondly, Haliburton is a great young talent but sitting there and hoping everything turns around over night isn’t going to work. They went out and got a proven 2 time all-star.@SacramentoKings doing #sacramentokings things.

#NBATradeDeadline@KicksontheBrain @SacramentoKings sabonis is potentially our best player right now and i think the team isn’t done making trades. also, if they trade fox now they’d be selling lowI like Sabonis… but @SacramentoKings y’all can’t convince the fan base this was the right move. https://t.co/qVFB9T0eZH@Clayton58763081 @kkdreamss @nbatrend @SacramentoKings @CacheCreekCR This doesnt even make senseSacramento Kings fans going to love next season even more when they get on board The Russell Westbrook ExperienceIf you’re having a bad day, just remember that @Dsabonis11 just got traded to the Sacramento KingsCurrent mood of @SacramentoKings fans https://t.co/kcTLxtu165@ambaavk @SacramentoKings Which is why I’m baffled we traded him so fast. He’s barely been with us for 2 seasons ughh@BlockedByBamba Eternally grateful for the Sacramento Kings who will forever make the Orlando Magic FO look like good@statmuse @SacramentoKings Sabonis is better what r the pacers doing fr@feyderade @SacramentoKings I think it’s “win now”, but getting a 25 year old  2 time all star with two years left is building for the future as well. Remember, while the Kings can’t attract free agents, they tend to keep their own. Also only 2 games out of the 10 seed… which is kinda the playoffs.When Sabonis found out he’s going from the 19-36 Pacers to the 20-35 Sacramento Kings https://t.co/fbn0QeK25tI’m honor of the Kings’ trade disaster:

End of storyMy takeaway is that Minnesota plays the kings in their next two games, &amp; Sacramento will basically be a G-League team for both games@FreeWxll I feel you but if I was a kings fan Id be pretty tired of watching bad basketball hoping one day we land a good player in the draft as opposed to trying to put out the best product. Either way its the kings they will always be Sacramento lol@Sportsnet @Pacers @SacramentoKings @wojespn Why?  Bottom dwellers trading assets. Does not make sense.I like the Indiana and #sacramentokings  trade@robinlundberg Twitter also seems to forget Sabonis is…

1) 25 years old
2) on one of the most team friendly deals in the NBA ($18.7M AAV thru 2024)
3) A great short &amp; long term roster fit for the kings

Idk what I’m missing, but the widespread outrage towards Sacramento seems very misinformed. @SacramentoKings updating their logo to coincide with this #Haliburton trade. https://t.co/svWbEoz8x6It's not the NBA tradeline if the Sacramento Kings aren't making some dumbass decision.

Make no mistake about it, with Sabonis in the lineup they’ll probably squeak into the play-in tournament.

I like it for both honestly.@AM24_TheGreat I agree Sabonis is a bucket but I think the kings def could’ve formed Halliburton and worked on his development more I mean he’s young as hell. Him and Buddy had allot of potential with Sacramento in my opinion@SacramentoKings @CacheCreekCR Ya keep building around a pg that can’t shoot or play defense.The #Pacers and #Kings have worked out a blockbuster trade that will send Tyrese Haliburton to Indiana and Domantas Sabonis to Sacramento, per @wojespn https://t.co/8VXlCa1RXMBoff. Sacramento’s owners needs to be Donald Sterling’ed. Kings could’ve got Sabonis and kept Halliburton. https://t.co/rKzt8a4n3q@sacicequeen @SacramentoKings Let's see how it plays out! I'm excited for something new. Will the kid!🏀👑💜It's time to spare the citizens of Sacramento of the Kings.

Yeah brad you're really doing everything you can to get banner 18. I don't see the Celtics doing anything news worthy at the deadline and I hate it.@TonyBiasotti It’s absurd to compare Sabonis with Chris Webber. Poor Kings fans are grasping at straws.

Btw, I’ve been in the Sacramento area for a few weeks and I haven’t heard anyone mention the Kings or seen any kids wearing Kings jerseys.

Thanks.Sacramento Kings trade Tyrese Haliburton, Buddy Hield, &amp; Tristan Thompson to the IND Pacers for Domantas Sabonis, Jeremy Lamb, Justin Holiday, &amp; a ‘27 RD2.

But with Sabonis bein' an All Star, I feel like that's a win now move, when we ain't ready for that. Gave up a big piece for the future on a move that doesn't make sense for our position.

Great trade for the pacers, kings more like Sacramento fuKINGStupidpray for Sacramento kings fansIdk how I feel about the kings moving hali for sabonis..

LMAOWhen @kirkgoldsberry devotes his afternoon to show just how special the player you just traded was... you probably made a mistake @SacramentoKings #Pacers https://t.co/L9xDSkk266@NotRyanMcD There’s no doubt he’s a top 15 Sacramento King all time I don’t think so but sheeeesh@NovaNoha @SacramentoKings Nfu! I got your point, but with the new play-in tournament, they might got a chance to be solidWhitesides for Barnes, Bagley, and Queta @SacramentoKingsThe real reason #sacramentokings traded Ty.
He wants to fix it, Gentry and McNair want to destroy it.
This is why Shaq sold his share.
#NBA #SadDay #patheticOwners https://t.co/1s7CaDAVmIThe @SacramentoKings have shown today that some cities just deserve a sports franchise. #SacramentoProud  #nbaThe Sacramento Kings might sneakily be the worst run franchise in sports.@SacramentoKings No anymoreWhat a pathetic ass franchise @SacramentoKings@SacramentoKings is a Talent Toilet. The place where dreams get flushed… why Sabonis? I’m having a great fantasy year and here comes the kings to waste Sabonis’s talentThe only thing that’d make moving Hali more devastating this deadline is if it’s the only move Monte and the @SacramentoKings decide to make. 

Still 2 days away from the deadline.

Can’t help but to think the Kings are nowhere near done with making moves.Y’all stink @SacramentoKings@_dreiparas @SacramentoKings @TyHaliburton22 Twenty more years of pain lol@trailblazers are drunk…. @SacramentoKings are WASTED. #NBATradeDeadline@statmuse @SacramentoKings Sacramento doing Sacramento things@mmcnair not Tyrese! He’s the heart and soul! Give a 1st rounder instead! #sacramentokings @Vivek 😩The entire NBA community is perplexed by the Sacramento Kings doing Sacramento Kings things.

That’s how you know you’re a really really really bad franchise@SacramentoKings @CacheCreekCR This whole  organization is a joke, you build around #Haliburton.

No wonder why Sacramento has been bad for so long 😂 https://t.co/94koA5tCD8So we know if you want to get traded away from the  @SacramentoKings all you have to do is say you want to change they culture there. They literally live for mediocrity.@Packers_Caleb @SacramentoKings @CacheCreekCR successful ratio!@ColeyMick @SacramentoKings I’ve been a kings fan my whole life and I like the Sabonis trade@Mr_CWBullock Bro, this trade is so gross. Once I saved up some more money I was going to buy this sick “Sactown” Tyrese Haliburton jersey. Thank god that didn’t happen lol I’m going to a Kings game in March and now I have no reason to root for Sacramento. https://t.co/LiVBpOswz0@SacramentoKings y’all the most pathetic franchise https://t.co/OzGYSBAGnn@MarcosBreton @SacramentoKings Love your passion, but we got an all-star on a good contract for a player we picked 12th just two years ago. Don’t be irrationally attached to talent. That’s what got us here.One of the things I don't understand about this move on the Kings end is that Tyrese is making clear strides and still has two more years left on his rookie contract after 21-22 before becoming an RFA. Think that would be the type of player Sacramento would cherish.I am sad to see @TyHaliburton22 leave @SacramentoKings I only wish him the best. Hoping Kings can make this new roster work.....been too long manI’ve never seen a fanbase get so mad at acquiring a 25 year old two-time All Star like @SacramentoKings fans@nbirtcil @SacramentoKings @TyHaliburton22 @CarmichaelDave The trade has grown on me. We got an allstar without giving up picks.@MarcosBreton @SacramentoKings Damn@SacramentoKings are the @HoustonTexans of the NBA 😂😂😂Being in that Sacramento Kings space is nasty behavior.@SacramentoKings, Y’all are fucking stupid! Tyrese was one of the best assets to this team and so much untapped potential. 🤦🏽‍♂️

I truly don’t understand why I stay loyal to this stupid franchise. I thought when the Maloofs were gone everything would change. 😭The last time the Kings traded away a well-liked guard in Sacramento for a young forward that has game was in 1998:

The trade: Mitch Richmond for Chris Webber.

Can Sabonis be that Chris Webber for Sacramento to get them winning again? Who knows.In terms of fan favorite value, losing @TyHaliburton22 is a uppercut knockout to the jaw of all @SacramentoKings fans. Wish nothing but the best for him in Indiana. But I believe in an eye for an eye, and the Kings landing a proven All-Star in Sabonis in return COULD be very big.HYPOTHETICALLY ... 

For the SAME Sabonis/Lamb/Holiday/2nd rd pick ...

Would you rather have had the #sacramentokings trade involve Tyrese Haliburton or De'Aaron Fox?

#sacramentoproud #NBATwitterSacramento Kings should be moved to Seattle. Put them out of their misery already.What's Sacramento Kings doing?! 🤦🏾‍♂️ https://t.co/6ZTegmr79f@SacramentoKings might be the worst organization in the universe@ColeyMick @SacramentoKings Coley this isn’t funny to joke about. Some people would give up much more for their freedom.give him to Boston then @SacramentoKings https://t.co/eUpBuCrZw9@IAmMattBetz Lmao one dude just said Sabonis is already a top 15 player in Sacramento kings history and hes actually right lmaoLet me be straight 💯. The @SacramentoKings on the court Win/Lost record has no effect on my life…. None! But the estimated $11.5 billion in economic activity for the Sacramento region does. Remember, this is Business, Not Personal. #chessnotcheckersI refuse to let the culture of what the Kings have been in the past take over who I am as a person...  I'm a member of the Sacramento Kings so I'm gonna help fix this. It ain't gonna be in a day but ima be here and we're gonna make it work I promise that."

I doubt the success Sabonis had in Indiana will translate to Sacramento https://t.co/ZQsowPsJASIn order for this man to purchase the Sacramento Kings and lay waste to the franchise he had to sell his GSW shares. We owe him the world 💀😂 https://t.co/yvMQ8SarRe@TheStockGuru5 @mommas_baby123 @statmuse @SacramentoKings Fox can't shoot. End of discussion.The @SacramentoKings make me sickWho hates Damontas Sabonis ? Why is he going to basketball Siberia (Sacramento Kings)  ?@SacramentoKings announce the Harrison Barnes tradeThe @SacramentoKings front office said “no, embrace the suck or get traded I guess”😂 https://t.co/LtJ6zO5a0tevery day i wake up and thank the universe for not making me a sacramento kings fan https://t.co/WgnOFJisGFalright imma go to sleep fellas! Shame on you @SacramentoKings. https://t.co/Uujcdp1yho@BransonOtis99 @SacramentoKings leave me alone I’m sobbing at my work desk@Alex13zo @SacramentoKings Not sure. Just likes the guy. Likes his style of game. I know he’s had him a couple times on his fantasy team, so maybe that?I’m 2 seconds away from revoking my fandom from the Sacramento kingsBREAKING: The Indiana #Pacers have traded Domantas Sabonis to the Sacramento Kings. What the Pacers got in return and how it impacts their future. 

Myles Turner "gets to play center now and appears thrilled with the idea of playing with Haliburton":
https://t.co/wO1GudH5tWi am so glad my family moved away from sacramento before i was old enough to become a kings fan@AlexCobbCYYoung @SacramentoKings @CacheCreekCR Bro I am from sac and moved to NC in 2018, I left the Kings last year for Charlotte and Minnesota and a mf is very happy🤣Go home you’re drunk @SacramentoKings https://t.co/5T2VvzwZto@TheStockGuru5 @mommas_baby123 @statmuse @SacramentoKings You should stop talking about basketball@sethtosta @urinalcaca @statmuse @SacramentoKings So if you’re not a playoff team despite any moves you can make… then keep your best young player around to become a playoff team. Not trade him for an older guy who expires in 2 yearsthe Sacramento Kings Franchise doesn’t even care how disappointing they are to their city. it’s like they’re trying to 1up themselves on being the lousiest franchise in the NBA. embarrassing for Kings fans.Glad someone can see it.. @SacramentoKings @NotMikeFromCorn https://t.co/QvTIIyjIftI don’t tweet much but holy shit @SacramentoKings y’all dumb as hell 😂@MarcosBreton @SacramentoKings I agree it’s very hard losing Tyrese however if you consider that there are only two players with tradable value it makes sense. I bet Tyrese’s value is higher than Fox. The return is actually good getting Sabonis if Kings use the other two to bundle in trade opportunities.You can’t buy loyalty and trust in this league, but you can draft it imo. That’s why I always tell ppl that drafting smart, competitive and talented players is the only way the Kings will ever be good again. Bc lets face it, no free agent wants to come and play for Sacramento.@TaylorTravess @SacramentoKings Damn right@TheMikeSalk @CarmichaelDave After the 15 years of Sacramento Kings suckfest, this is what upsets you?They should relocate the Sacramento Kings to Columbus, OH and sell the team.@SacramentoKings y’all really losing some fans 🤦🏿‍♂️ the kings fam aint happy, giving @TyHaliburton22 away is just too soonExistence as @SacramentoKings fan is pure pain. I can’t believe this shit@espn @wojespn @SacramentoKings y’all should go after Russell Westbrook he has a ton of upside I’m hearing.@wakeuplui3 @SacramentoKings kings should trade davion for jerami grant theres no need for davion imo@ColeyMick @SacramentoKings Well even throw in Bruno@Lukinator111 @SacramentoKings Why is Sabonis his favorite player?porzingis for fox who says no @SacramentoKings@SacramentoKings @CacheCreekCR FucKINGStupid@sethtosta @statmuse @SacramentoKings Oke of the players they got can’t even play home games 😭😭 they still have a cluster fuck of players in the front court. They need to move Holmes/Bagley for sure to make this trade deadline a W. Otherwise it’s an L Tyrese is worth more than Sabonis@TyHaliburton22 @SacramentoKings Welcome to Indy … u will love our fans … we are excited@elijah_wilson_ @SacramentoKings They gave up everybody including Fox who is still on the team lolSacramento kings will always be the kings of making stupid decisions. They let go of a stud to build around and now just lost for words. #Haliburton #Pacers #sacramentokings  are the worst when it comes to fucking their fans over just when it is starting to come together.Second (but maybe not last!) episode of @FrontOfficeShow is up! @Trevor_Lane and I break down the Pacers-Kings, Sabonis-Haliburton trade.

let that sink in. https://t.co/xNat0WFpRtDon't understand why you would trade Haliburton?? Wonder why you never can get to the playoffs. Feel bad for the Kings fanbase @SacramentoKingsSometimes I think being an Angels fan is painful, but the Sacramento Kings might just be the most painful team to be a fan of in all of sports@Nate_SoSwavey24 @GeauxLsuShaq I don’t do spaces. That shit weird and City of Sacramento Kings fans are fraudulent fans and can’t hoop.My poor son. He’s a Lakers fan through and through. But Sabonis is his favorite player. And now he’s all upset his guy is going to rot in perpetuity on the @SacramentoKings …..@NoDunksInc there's no vaccine mandate to play in Sacramento, thats just a SF city requirement, fairly certain at least one or two current Kings players also unvaxedKings-Pacers trade: Domantas Sabonis heads to Sacramento; Tyrese Haliburton, Buddy Hield to Indiana - ZellaNews

Give us FoxPretty polite of Sacramento to not waste years of Haliburton's career being a King@champipplepapi I will always maintain that the Kings are one pro franchise that shouldn't exist. Makes no sense for Sacramento to have a pro basketball team.The Sacramento Kings have to be the Top 5 dumbest organizations in professional sports …..years of stupidityYou know that feeling where, like, you get fired from your job but then you find out someone you knew from high school just got arrested for wire fraud? That’s what the Sacramento Kings provide for the rest of the league.Buddy Hield was shooting 43% from deep on 8 attempts per game a few years ago. While playing for the Kings. The Sacramento Kings. They broke his spirit and soul, like so many fallen talents before him, but he might end up a Hall of Famer now that he has rid himself of that evil.I sometimes forget how long it’s been since Boogie was a Sacramento King https://t.co/vu82IQwyFb@TyHaliburton22 @SacramentoKings A bitter trade, and a waste of love on our part. Never seen a draft pick that excited to play for us before. Were the coaches watching the same player I was??

Best of luck in Indiana 💔✌️Thoughts and Prayers to De’aaron Fox. Ain’t nothing wrong with him, he’s just stuck on the Sacramento Kings for the rest of his career. Terrible circumstances https://t.co/JgKjqU2FEZThis almost feels like when the @SacramentoKings traded DemarcusI hate being a @SacramentoKings fan https://t.co/jpLKGg0907NEW: The Indiana #Pacers make a blockbuster trade with the Sacramento Kings, moving 2x All-Star, Domantas Sabonis.

Was looking forward to u thriving here. Thank u for everythingI have some thoughts on this IND/SAC trade…

Why not trade Fox or Mitchell instead of Hali? 

As I tweeted earlier, SAC doing SAC things‼️

Poor Sabonis. Guy was linked to so many other teams not named the Sacramento Kings.

Indy season win total under 💰@SacramentoKings please tell me this was just a nightmare and that you guys aren’t really that stupid?? @Vivek Tyrese Halliburton? Are you fuckin serious??@MarcosBreton @SacramentoKings It’s true@TyHaliburton22 don't feel bad @SacramentoKings have a history or making terrible decisions thats why their social media accounts are full of memes because its the meme franchise of the NBA.

A massive and potentially franchise-altering error by Sacramento Kings front office.@sethtosta @statmuse @SacramentoKings A player who is a ufa in 2 years and doesn’t elevate your team to a playoff teamKings fans really have the most incompetent team in the league and they have to live in Sacramento I’d be on life support right now@TyHaliburton22 @SacramentoKings I want to cry 😢.You are  the best player on the team with an amazing all-star potential.

is it gonna be sacramento’s brand to tell players they’re safe only to suddenly trade them right before the trade deadline@NESTVOFFICIVL @SacramentoKings Let’s hear itWTF are the Sacramento Kings doing?Guys like Sabonis don’t sign free agent contracts to come to Sacramento. Getting a guy of his caliber has to be done this way. And I think the Kings did a marvelous job of selling high on a Halliburton to bring in Sabonis. That said - will miss him as a King.@brawadis @SacramentoKings He should have never told PHX he didn't want them to draft him.@SacramentoKings what is y’all doing lol and kings ownership to the fans rn after trading away @TyHaliburton22 https://t.co/ByBTa8xqvh@DaveLack Sabonis is objectively better.

Only good part is taxes for them.@SacramentoKings Nice one guysDumb ass @SacramentoKings !! @Vivek can’t possibly be this stupid. Right?Jeremy Lamb in years past has actually been on the Sacramento Kings radar. Nice player and i think a nice filler for TD til he gets better.This is going to take some time to get used to 👀

It’s more than what @TyHaliburton22 can and will do on the court. It’s more than his aura and potential leadership skills.

It’s that the fans loved him.

#NBA75 #trade #ESPN #Kings #Pacers https://t.co/HZ1q86xoDKLMAO @SacramentoKingsSacramento Kings are a gift that just keep on giving https://t.co/wKXdq2CSiMI think the @SacramentoKings love to tank every yearThank you @IOGEAR @KingsGuardGG and to the @SacramentoKings for hooking me up with all of this awesome streaming and gaming gear! I'm excited! 😁 #winner #kingsguard #sacramentokings @iogear #streaming #gamer #gaming https://t.co/TKCu0Cpgtm@JtheBizDev @SacramentoKings I mean... considering personality, I'd take Sabonis before Simmons too. Simmons did this to himself. Ruined a winning situation. He'd show his ass losing in the West.We're the Detroit Lions of the NBA

#SacramentoKings@justtucckker @SacramentoKings Cuz you’re not getting a player close to Sabonis’s level with Bagley.@SacramentoKings trade Neemy pleaseI’m a Mariners and Timberwolves fan.

#SacramentoKingsfucKINGStupid… @SacramentoKings@Dsabonis11 welcome to the @SacramentoKings https://t.co/tcuo1snmlO@tennessee987 @SacramentoKings No thanks. It’s not just about judging the trade. Sabonis is a talent, I get that. Tyrese is a once in a great while kind of player. He’s the kind that is heart and soul for a franchise. More than just his basketball talents who he were immense as well.Sacramento kings are the worst franchise in basketball… goin dark😪😪So where are the @SacramentoKings getting their offense from?  Sabonis is not exactly a reliable scorer. #NBATradeDeadlineThe Sacramento Kings rn… https://t.co/3g0mhagdpIMy team lets me down year after year but I’m strong though 😭🥲 @SacramentoKings but welcome SabonisThe Sacramento Kings need to be investigated @NBACan’t even explain how sick I am about losing @TyHaliburton22. @SacramentoKings are out of their minds.Three @SacramentoKings things...
1. I assume this is a precursor to other deals so hard to judge this right away.
2. People were upset when J-Will was traded away, let's hope this ends up similarly.
3. Haliburton let you shed two net negatives and get a recent All Star. Wow.Sacramento Kings lost Zeke Cross, Tyrese Halliburton, and Buddy In one week. Pain@iamghaire I think the Kings are regretting staying in Sacramento. They should have allowed Chris Hanson to buy the team and move it to Seattle. #JustSayin#NBA Twitter: Blazers lost to those trades..
Sacramento Kings: HOLD..MY.. 🍺This is why I think Brian Flores is a b****.

Alvin Gentry and Monte McNair are both okay throwing games and seasons.
@SacramentoKings @NFL
#TankForThatBank 
$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$ https://t.co/uaaOBF3LD8@RobKSports Sacramento didn’t get fleece in this deal they actually got the better player. Sabonis is the real deal. He average 18.9 12.1 and 5 assists. Tyrese Halliburton average 14.3 7.4 and 3.9 rebounds. Plus the kings got D Fox and D Mitchell That small guard lineup was getting killed!!@SacramentoKings you guys alright ??????!!!!!@statmuse @SacramentoKings i miss him.@SacramentoKings should've been sold to Seattle a whole back lol@SacramentoKings @CacheCreekCR That was a hell of a move...

If for good or bad, I honestly can't tell right now.
Same for Indiana.

I guess won't be last move... we'll see how eventually things settle up.What the hell are the Sacramento Kings doing lmaoI only buy vintage @SacramentoKings jerseys… kings have been horrible since The Maloof brothers left… period@PackripEwing Sacramento is lighting the kings up right now@isaacpwilson @SacramentoKings Crazy they gave up Halliburton@TyHaliburton22 @SacramentoKings I’m crying rn bruh@SacramentoKings tryna rebuild the franchise https://t.co/N9TPo2UY5G@JillAdge @TyHaliburton22 Love Tyrese as much as any former King. And I know for a fact he is going to be a star.

I'm just so sad it isn't going to be in Sacramento.sacramento kings creating broken homes https://t.co/qneOpW74c4@FantasyLabsNBA @SacramentoKings , your GM Sucks.Meanwhile, in the Sacramento Kings subreddit... https://t.co/BloyfG8hVEImma need @SacramentoKings fans to be patient and really look at who Sabonis is and understand that he is going to be worth it. We WILL make the playoffs next season and might even avoid the play in. I believe in the kings. That hasn’t gotten me anywhere in my 39 years but… waitThe @SacramentoKings remain one of the worst run franchises in the NBA if not the worst. I mean what in the world are you doing?#Kings traded Haliburton to #Pacers in pkg for Sabonis??!! I guess that means #Sacramento is keeping De'Aron, DAMN!!! 🤬 #Knicksthe 2001-02 @SacramentoKings were the greatest team to never win a championship. #NBA75Haliburton &gt; Fox .. come on @SacramentoKings , how you let him go?It is so rare that a team trades a highly-gifted player with enormous potential in only his second year of a rookie contract.  And we wonder why the Sacramento Kings keep failing to make the playoffs.  Dysfunction.As sure as the sun rises in the east and sets in the west the Sacramento Kings front office will unfailingly make the dumbest move possible@SacramentoKings fucking dumbest shit ever. Tyrese Halliburton??? Are you fucking kidding me???? I’m fucking done. Y’all just lost me. Halliburton was our guy. I fucking hate this team so much. Dumbest franchise ever. When will you guys stop being so stupid????? #sacramentokingsThe @SacramentoKings are stupid I’m actually getting angry for their fans. The incompetence is on a other level https://t.co/uZxqY1017QSacramento Kings …….why 😒🤦‍♂️just whyThe Los Angeles Lakers stole a title from the Sacramento Kings and they’ve been in hell ever since. https://t.co/47s096pIno@eja003 @SacramentoKings Ok, just read about that trade. Um, that actually appears to be a good piece of business by the Kings. You get yourself a tough, hard-nosed All-Star Center for a very good but not All-Star guard, Lamb's not a bad shooter &amp; you got rid of Hield's big contract.Dear @SacramentoKings how are we supposed to complain about 2K trade logic when y’all out here turning down Ben Simmons to get Sabonis?!?@SacramentoKings @CacheCreekCR Should've moved to SeattleMy girl is like the Sacramento kings. She’s never getting a ring. #Kings #SacKings@coachfatten @SacramentoKings @cameronsalerno1 @SacBee_JoeD I agree. I think Sobonis is a great pick up, but did we actually think that we wouldn’t have to give up a key young asset in a mid season trade?When De'aaron Fox found of Tyrese Haliburton got out of Sacramento before he did. #Kings #NBA https://t.co/kUMpVe8gZt@kkdreamss @nbatrend @SacramentoKings @CacheCreekCR I don’t blame him tbhSo the @SacramentoKings just trading to trade 🧐😭🤔@supremekangzz @MarcosBreton @SacramentoKings You're right. This move could be a good one, but boy it feels like a spear through the gut.Kings tryna get booted out of Sacramento might as well shut them down and open a new joint in Seattle 👁 https://t.co/YCGIceQaUwWhat does fox do better than Tyrese???  @SacramentoKingsIf the @SacramentoKings keep losing before the #supersonics come back, f*ck it that my new team #sacramentokings  @Vivek #NBA #NBATradeDeadline@darth_mays @docileveer @SacramentoKings I second this vouch@MatheusNG26 O Sacramento Kings… https://t.co/cNPjwDZcRwThe Sacramento Kings have managed to suck for close to two decades. This is truly astounding!Then the Sacramento Kings are WASTED https://t.co/GGr11HYqyQ@THEmikemitchell @SacramentoKings 😂 freals!Remember this... Tyrese Haliburton will be ANOTHER star the @SacramentoKings got rid of while the Kings continue to not make the playoffs... So upset about this trade... Or more appropriate would be, this heist...@my_chappie @SacramentoKings @CacheCreekCR Sadly you fell off harder than Lil skiesTyrese is gone and the @SacramentoKings play today… https://t.co/wyUzQFdFyEthey got PushingPonk running the Sacramento Kings@SacramentoKings  and @PelicansNBA both got a lot better today but realistically there is only one play in spot available, and the @spurs have a good chance at it too. I think the Kings keeping their draft pick and dropping Hield's contract is a bigger deal than people realize@JustinTrangsrud @SacramentoKings @24Roger_S Such a clown show in Sacramento. Unfortunately, I think they would’ve relocated to Seattle for real but got that new arena so now it’ll never happen. I really do hope the Pelicans move there, though. They’re kind of a mess too + have zero fans, crap arena and no real history@SacramentoKings TIME TO MOVE TO SEATTLE OR LAS VEGAS!!!Being a Sacramento Kings fan is one of the dumbest things I've ever done.Sources: Haliburton to Indy, Sabonis to Kings #Sacramento #Kings #NBA https://t.co/3fB8v0gzlMSacramento Kings Roster https://t.co/1LHkACoI3E@statmuse @greenbean3742 @SacramentoKings Getting a 25 yr old that can average a triple doubleoh yall lil dumbass mfs😂😂 @SacramentoKings@SacramentoKings @CacheCreekCR Poverty@SeamusTate @MarcosBreton @SacramentoKings I hear you especially about the last part because that’s what I see the pelicans doing with Zion Ingram cj etc. they’re the pelicans so they’ll find a way to make it not work. But this trade for us is the potential franchise changing move we needed especially if we make play-in..@SacramentoKings y’all should be considered as a t3rrorist organizationIdk bout that trade @SacramentoKingsSo y’all runnin with Fox Mitchell Barnes Sabonis &amp; Holmes for now?

Okay… just make sure Bagley gets his 27+ minutes 👀

@SacramentoKings@kkdreamss @JJetsSZNN @yrnevan_ @SacramentoKings @CacheCreekCR Everyone wants the lions to succeed Nobody gaf about the kings 😭@wojespn @SacramentoKings need to disband as a team right now. That’s a poverty franchise.My reaction and spinzone to my beloved Sacramento Kings trading my most podcast-pilled son. https://t.co/APJVb5RCl4 https://t.co/TIqPXwUuqBI also don’t think this is a bad trade...I just HATE giving up guys who genuinely want to be in Sacramento.

Why the Kings love to stockpile PGs and Bigs when wings are generally the most valuable commodities in basketball is another topic, but Kangz until proven Kings 🤷🏻‍♂️@TyHaliburton22 thanks for everything you did for the @SacramentoKings! I hope you excel and become a great player 🥲@sportslarryknbr @KNBR The Sacramento Kings have turned into the Detroit Lions.Kings and Blazers are big losers today. Blazers are at least in full rebuild. I don't know what the Kings are doing. Honestly, it's a franchise hovering in purgatory. Beyond disappointed in Sacramento's moves the past 15 years.@SacramentoKings Looks like you guys need a point guard... https://t.co/foff7w9cyyEverything for sale @trailblazers @SacramentoKings ??The Sacramento Kings are by far the worst run franchise in American professional sports

I know this answer isn't enthusiastic, but how can you let a young, almost free piece that wants to be part of a successful future with you be traded with your other star for a center? Why?!? https://t.co/bteMBYW47XBooooooooo I hate u @SacramentoKings https://t.co/6nVOoDISc1Sabonis is fuckin nice I’m calling it a @SacramentoKings W. If they keep Fox of course.Wait.  Are these just RUMORS of did the @SacramentoKings just trade Haliburton to Indiana?The Sacramento Kings traded Tyrese Haliburton before Marvin Bagley III. No words.Posts made moments before disaster @SacramentoKings https://t.co/29tHNoZR0ZIf Sacramento offers a similar package to Philly for Ben, does Philly accept? And if you’re the kings, would you rather have Ben or Sabonis? https://t.co/IVTys70Pb3@statmuse @SacramentoKings Tyrese is the future, the Kings are lostTYRESE WAS LIKE THE REDEEMING FACTOR OF OUR DUMBASS TEAM HOW COULD YOU LET HIM GO @mmcnair @SacramentoKingsSacramento Kings might be the dumbest franchise in sportsRemember back in 2013 when #Sacramento rejoiced that we didn’t lose the @SacramentoKings? Feels like a dumb thing to be celebrating now considering the constant middle fingers fans get from ownership. 

Gunna miss ya @TyHaliburton22@SacramentoKings @CacheCreekCR Bro you can have the next Michael Jordan and still fuck it up🤣🤣🤣 how is it possible that the #Kings make the worst trades year after year, decade after decade?

Vivek you suckThe Kings had to pick between Fox and Haliburton. Clearly they felt Sabonis was better than anything Fox was bringing back. It's great that they didn't send any firsts to Indiana. Seems like Sacramento is willing to gamble that Fox/Sabonis works better than Fox/Hali long-termWTF are we doing?!?!?!?!?!? F this front office, F this ownership group, Can't fix S**T

The Kings should’ve moved to Seattle, like, yesterday.@SeamusTate @MarcosBreton @SacramentoKings I am devastated! He was such a bright light draft pick - FOR once! Smart- great NBA IQ &amp; his passing is unmatched! Wonderful teammate- passionate, cared, showed non stop effort! Willing to learn &amp; try &amp; play defense but could &amp; would!

#NBATradeDeadline@SacramentoKings haven’t made playoffs since 2006. We needed to rebuild. We’ve needed to actually rebuild the team for two decades. We went for the win now team with no shooters or defenders on this roster. Sabonis will be gone in two years because we will accomplish nothing.Sacramento Kings fans, would you have preferred Sabonis or Julius Randle in the Haliburton trade? Just curiousFans of the @SacramentoKings need to boycott this franchise. #KingsSuckThe Sacramento Kings' owner's son didn't hire me for his fund last month, and I was pissed.

If so, can they somehow fail Sabonis' physical to save face? hahaOnly explanation for the @SacramentoKings is we got a Major League situation in our clubhouse, an owner who WANTS us to lose... the moment Haliburton said he wanted to turn it around, and he would stay to see it through, they knew he had to go. ONLY explanation!SACRAMENTO KINGS WHAT ARE YOU DOING https://t.co/5SZSZIS3ES@guythanosddd @SacramentoKings Alex would be a godsend compared to the (insert disparaging remarks here)  that made this fukn deal!

#sacramentokingsThe streets of Sacramento after the Kings traded Haliburton https://t.co/sHOOevHQZythe sacramento kings are an absolute joke hahahahah@SamQuinnCBS Agreed. The @SacramentoKings are foolish.The Pacers are traded Domas Sabonis, Jeremy Lamb and Justin Holiday to Sacramento for Tyrese Hailburton, Buddy Hield and Tristan Thompson Sabonis is an excellent player I don’t believe he makes the Kings better Kings just gave up too much🤦‍♂️🤷‍♂️💯 #SacramentoProud #Pacers https://t.co/Ik6fe78dQzThe Sacramento Kings really fired Vlade Divac and then traded a 21 year-old shooting 41% on high volume from 3 for an overrated clone of Divac.Dumbest franchise in NBA history. Great job @SacramentoKings . My dead dog Chipper would be a better GM. I hate this team more everyday. https://t.co/MbgQTQlMIs@SacramentoKings why ya hate Marvin Bagley so much?The Kings, Pistons and Timberwolves have finalized a deal who sends Marvin Bagley III and G Killian Hayes to Minnesota, Josh Jackson to Sacramento and Malik Beasley to Detroit. Draft considerations are involved too.The job of a comedian is to run the Sacramento Kings basketball organization. https://t.co/nPcYN4jvVz@SpaceRunnersNFT @Timberwolves @SacramentoKings Wow amazing!!!!!!

That would be hilarious if you did though@ryenarussillo Did Fox not want to play with Halliburton and the Kings chose Fox? Makes no sense unless you realize it’s the Sacramento Kings management .Domantas Sabonis and other assets has been traded to the Sacramento Kings in exchange for Tyrese Haliburton and more!

Sucks right@matthieu_jay @SacramentoKings It’s gut wrenching. But I saw a comparison to the J-Will-Bibby trade. We traded a beloved player and ended up better.

A rebuild fresh and the draft is coming. Meanwhile Sacramento is still in the gutter. The Kings ainT it since Chris Webber got the boot kick out the door@ryanteston @young_quince @statmuse @SacramentoKings Yep, that strategy worked out great when they passed on Luka…are we sure the Kings ever needed to stay in Sacramento? https://t.co/gvEeL96OGS@TyHaliburton22 @SacramentoKings Miss you already King. You deserved better. Good luck in IndianaThe Sacramento Kings drove the green by drafting Tyrese Haliburton out of Iowa State with the 12th overall pick.

You don't have to do this by yourself.I formally submit my resignation for being a @SacramentoKings fan.

The Kings basically chose a Fox/Sabonis tandem over (reportedly) a Randle/Haliburton duo, which would’ve cost them less than half as much? 

Is that the duo Sacramento Kings fans would’ve picked?@Less_HumbleTeej If Kings fans ain't raise such a stink about the team leaving Sacramento, they wouldn't have this problem. RIP JihaDLol @SacramentoKings refusing to give up halliburton in a deal for simmons and then trading him for Sabonis 😂🤣 https://t.co/Oz9FxeyyzlThe Sacramento Kings really went full Sacramento Kings today. I respect the commitment to keeping it on brand.What an abomination the Sacramento Kings have become. All those efforts to keep them in Sactown, and they still suck. Just a terribly run franchise. https://t.co/Z5nQ7gdZUG@TyHaliburton22 is going to be the best player in the trade and Kings fans will be forced to watch him excel knowing we could still have him. Thanks @SacramentoKings@docileveer @SacramentoKings VouchAfter 25+ years of being a @SacramentoKings fan, I’m officially done with them after that trade. The organization can just die for all I care now. Hope Haliburton drops 50 on the Kangz the next time the Pacers play them at Golden 1.@SacramentoKings cant believe you traded tyrese https://t.co/nxlaUR2gLj@SacramentoKings What’s next??

You traded the one young piece that actually wanted to win and one of the best shooters in the league … 

@SacramentoKings Sell the fucking team and stop embarrassing our cityWTF!!! This is a joke right.... @SacramentoKings https://t.co/omMV80G1ES@PeeWeeDaPlug Sacramento needs the kings don’t take them from us 😭😭@NovaNoha @SacramentoKings Might be crazy, but the new roster is taking an interesting shape, D’avion, Fox, Barnes, Sabonis, Holmes… striking power outside and insideDon’t ask the @SacramentoKings this 😂 https://t.co/06P1zFZsL5Pack it up @SacramentoKings@sewajpa @_JasonLT @vkillem Now look at it from the Kings perspective. We all thought Haliburton was the highest valued asset in Sacramento and they traded him for less value than we all thought Haliburton had.@GrantLiffmann We’re talking about the @SacramentoKings and @Vivek here 😂I could fix the Sacramento Kings. I could be their gm and make better moves@JCMacriNBA These Knicks fans are way to high on Haliburton, Sacramento valued him so much they put him in a package to shed Hield's salary. Thought the Kings valued him more than Fox?! At least that's what I heard from NBA Twitter!Can someone please explain tome how a player who is a role player on the pathetic Sacramento Kings is magically becoming a superstar because he got dealt to a somewhat less irrelevant and bad team?Aye @SacramentoKings you feel like taking Enes for De’Aaron Fox? Brad can throw in Payton Pritchard for you too if you really want himi can fix the sacramento kings front office@AtaMohammed8 @wustdontmiss @TheNBACentral Lol they did have a good run. Reminds me of the Webber version of Sacramento Kings. Good run. Didn’t win anything.@PodcastNipple @SacramentoKings Sabonis is great… but Hali and Buddy?! I don’t like itThe Pacers won that trade with the Kings. Tyrese Haliburton should've been a building block for the Kings, but given how incompetent Sacramento's management is, this shouldn't surprise me.
Are the Kings trying to do what the Bulls did this past offseason?@TyHaliburton22 @SacramentoKings We love you dude go kill it and maybe resign here❤️🥲Yo, the Sacramento Kings made my day today.

Y’all are terrible, it’s a disgrace to the league@BSWest5 As a Warriors fan that lives in Sacramento and follows the Kings, this trade reminds me of when the Warriors traded fan favorite Monta Ellis for Andrew Bogut. It was very much hated but the pieces worked better after the trade.@scottcardoso @SacramentoKings He’s young and hasn’t been with our team long. To me he’s still a rookie.@LuisFlores515 @SacramentoKings Bro…that is wild AF!!! Hali is a beast!

I personally give the edge to Sacramento. Yeah Tyrese has a ceiling, but they got a perennial all star in Sabonis and broke up the weird situation with Fox/Tyrese both being ball dominant guards. Kings got better today imoIt’d also almost assuredly keep the Spurs in SA considering Kings fans would be done with that franchise in Sacramento. https://t.co/HWVNcoM5O6The Sacramento Kings won’t see your tweets but your unstable friends  who screw up everything they touch will :(@statmuse @SacramentoKings doing what they always doingmight actually be done as a sacramento kings fan after today. if vivek pushed for this trade he is actually the biggest fool in the world.@caliking49er17 @SacramentoKings We’ve been rebuilding for 20 years.. just pathetic man.I seriously dont understand how Kings Fans still exist like you have the Warriors who play less than 2 hours away from where Sacramento is and yet u still root for one of the most poverty teams in the league@indocho @SDhillon07 @SacramentoKings Ooof I feel bad for you. You guys haven’t had a winning record in over 15 years but haven’t really been bad enough to snag a top pick either. Small market team too so it’s hard for you guys to attract stars.Will as a fan base we're fed up &amp; I don't know how a running OC fixes the Phins poor OLine play?

Things are getting crazy real quick!!

#IndianaPacers #SacramentoKings https://t.co/KD7JCemaOy@statmuse @SacramentoKings BIGGEST L TEAM IN SPORTS HISTORY.@therealjulzzz_ @SacramentoKings If this is the only move we make then I’ve lost hops all over again. I really like sabonis but I still believe that full rebuild is the way to go and trading Hali who’s probably the fan fav wasn’t the right move but we can’t be worse than we already 🤷🏽‍♂️The Sacramento Kings really traded Tyrese Haliburton over De'Aaron Fox who is slowly morphing into Tyreke Evans

These are both players into their year 4 seasons. https://t.co/BlkIkLSQTFI see that @SacramentoKings fans are handling things well https://t.co/R4S7rpH0vq@SacramentoKings are the definition of self sabotage 😂The fact that there’s an Emergency Sacramento Kings space is killing me right now this is comedy goldAnyway as a certified Sabonis hater I approve of his banishment to the basketball hell that is the Sacramento Kings!@SacramentoKings @CacheCreekCR Wonder why u can’t make it to the playoffs then u do trades like this🤣🤣🤣 garbage franchise@SacramentoKings I heard Tyler Herro likes it there.Kings need to be moved from Sacramento and need a new front office and ownership lol they are TERRIBLESacramento Kings without Chris Webber is the Worst Franchise in Sports HistoryI understand the Portland - New Orleans trade for both sides.

I have no clue what the Kings are doing in the Sacramento - Indiana trade.Great job @SacramentoKings. You let this guy go. 🤦‍♂️ https://t.co/MrJCvVnFQmDrafting good players and building around them to make the playoffs

The NBA needs to step in and stop this trade from happening. 

@nba @sacramentokings @Pacers@quietcoastmeng @ChewieWoolf @bflewis3 @Boards2Buckets @SacramentoKings @gold35rush @bpierce5 @SassyMcNBA yea but sabonis is an all star, hali isn’t really on that level rn@SacramentoKings y’all boys playing knock off money ball.

We keep a guy who was “untradable” in Fox. We don’t give up ANY draft picks…I like the trade. Loves Haliburton, but the @SacramentoKings got better@statmuse @SacramentoKings RatioI don't understand what Sacramento is trying to do. Sabonis isn't going to take the Kings to the playoffs this season.

Us: https://t.co/5GvyAFFtu4@malikshareef @SacramentoKings And now Bagley further down the depth chart, cause he probably can’t get traded this quick. It’s not like Sabonis plays fast which would be good for Fox. And now all the shooting has been shipped out. That lane is going to be closed to Fox.@NMartinez423 @SacramentoKings That’s true but most of the players they got are old as dirt. I was hoping they would trade for Jeremi grant and some younger players that can scoreHonestly forgot that the Sacramento Kings existed… 😳@SDhillon07 It’s hard being a @SacramentoKings fan. We can’t have nice things.First All Star we have had since????? I’m fine with this trade #kings #Sacramento #sackings@SportsCenter @wojespn They want to rebuild, so they trade away the most promising young player they have?

WTF?? What a dumb move but what can you expect when you have a bunch of clowns running the show in Sacramento.Sacramento Kings will forever be povertyCould’ve had Simmons @SacramentoKings@SacramentoKings I wish this team had been bought by a different group and moved to Seattle. You continue to fail at everything you do. https://t.co/4cVvALOvkiWhen you can trade a productive 21-year-old combo guard who can defend, pass, and shoot for a big who can't defend, you just have to do it. Right, @SacramentoKings?for the last 15 years GM's have been stealing millions of dollars failing to make the Sacramento Kings resemble anything that looks like a competent basketball team.
Today that continues.if you watch the movie, lady bird actually leaves sacramento because she was a kings fan@Chriftopher @Three_Cone I haven't seen anybody acting like that. Just saying the Kings are really stupid for trading Haliburton. Because they are. Sabonis is awesome and will put up stats in Sacramento, but you don't trade your 21-year-old franchise cornerstone for him.@kavithadavidson This is all ridiculous. They need to sell the Sacramento Kings. 

And the Pacers are a dumpster fire trading Sabonis. What a disaster on all FRONTSThe Sacramento Kings are foolish@SacramentoKings That’s a trade you make when you have a chance to go to play offs. You just got rid of the only dude you could build an atmosphere of winning around? Damn. Right when I thought it couldn’t get worse.I just don't understand the mindset of the Sacramento Kings in making that trade
#NBATradeDeadline@JustinLeise @BarnesxROTY @wojespn I'm looking forward to the first game Hield plays against Sacramento and then hearing their "super-homer" announcers criticize him for all the things they ignored when he was a Kings player.The Sacramento Kings are ran by a bunch of fucken idiotsAt this point I’m certain the @SacramentoKings are hell bent on consistently letting their fans down lol https://t.co/QyxqT9CiWy@SacramentoKings why do yall even exist.

@SacramentoKings wtf you doing?Sacramento Kings being Sacramento KingsSacramento Kings need to be removed from existence immediately https://t.co/CF8A9iDmgVI need Leon to get on the phone with the #Kings right now and get @MB3FIVE @swipathefox for the low low out of #Sacramento cause they clearly don’t know what they doin out there 😂😮‍💨THE SACRAMENTO KINGS TRADE TYRESE HALIBURTON TO THE PACERS FOR DOMANTAS ... https://t.co/ZlUQXsZZnc via @YouTubeSince y'all doing dumb shit, give us DeAaron Fox and Marvin Bagley for Daniel Theis and a replica Eldridge Recasner throwback jersey @SacramentoKings@bran6o @mommas_baby123 @statmuse @SacramentoKings Yeah I get you but realistically fox or hali wouldn’t be a huge difference for the kings lol. Either one they trade they will need to make several other big chances anyway to be contenders.@SacramentoKings although i like sabonis we can’t keep being a poverty franchise like this… why would you trade TH?@xBBKx @statmuse @SacramentoKings Kings have literally been smoking the L Pack my entire life this is insane.@ElPrimeTime415 @SacramentoKings @mmcnair facts, i figure he was untouchable but it’s the kangz, they continue to surprise meI can’t lie to y’all, I didn’t even know the Sacramento Kings had a fan base to piss off like this 😭At what point is it okay to switch teams as a fan? Cause @SacramentoKings don't give af bout us or winning.The Sacramento Kings are not good at this.@wojespn @SacramentoKings man… sell this team already. Hot mess. There’s is a reason the Kings are the Kings https://t.co/mZLDTtmrI8@statmuse @SacramentoKings As someone that doesn’t watch the Kings, why is everyone considering Tyrese better than Fox???Bright side for the Sacramento Kings is, if they hang on to De’Aaron Fox, I foresee Fox &amp; Sabonis being a lethal duo... shame the rest of the team’s a dumpster fire though.@AntS2_89 @SacramentoKings Bagley went to duke he can stay lol@HeuristicLineup I think after buyers remorse wears off it'll be fine. I believe the fans because we are Sacramento fall in love with our players. Once a King, always a King.Sacramento Kings who? Never heard of em... y’all be easy though.@SacramentoKings Fans are so done w/ this franchise. It’s laughable but y’all messed up when you let your guy Petrie go. Ur team is the ugly dude at the punch bowl for over 15 yrs now. 

But hey there is another purple u can rock&amp; rep Cali 😉Haliburton has size, motor, enhanced ball skills and a seasoned pull up jumper...

 The eternally cursed (See 2002 vs LAL) @SacramentoKings just fumbled their discount star who they could have had for cheap. #NBALadies and gentlemen….The Sacramento Kings….🤦🏽‍♂️ https://t.co/cjkqndSARNSacramento Content KingsI feel this inside my entire soul body and mind.

Kings Receive: Domantas Sabonis, Jeremy Lamb, and Justin Holiday

Pacers Receive: Tyrese Haliburton, Buddy Hield, and Tristan Thompson

WOW!!!@LangeIique Are you a Kings fan?

This is a really difficult situation for me. I feel like I'm coming from an abusive basketball relationship already, because I'm from New York. 

Living here in Sacramento now is giving me PTSD. Front offices making stupid moves is triggering.I'm convinced the Sacramento Kings are actually a product of my imagination and not a real NBA franchiseIf you don't know what to do with your life. Or you don't feel like you are smart enough to be where you want in life. Remember you can still be @SacramentoKings GM
Don't give up!Anytime the Sacramento Kings make a trade https://t.co/XXxdKwSX2SThe Sacramento Kings did Tyrese Haliburton dirty man. He didn't deserve this. 😐@brawadis @SacramentoKings IM GONNA KMSGood for Tyrese, he doesn’t have to rot in this hellhole of a franchise @SacramentoKingsHey @SacramentoKings can I get a refund for the Tyrese gear I bought? Idiotssacramento kings is sucksMaybe it's because i'm not high on Sabonis playstyle, how he scales to a contender or his fit on this kings team with questionable spacing but I don't see what Sacramento is trying to do.@wojespn I’m not a Kings fan at all and this pisses me off, that sucks for the franchise.. a 21 yr old with huge upside, a great shooter, and you get back the most unexciting fundamental type star in the league who’s own team doesn’t want. What are you doing Sacramento?@SacramentoKings Everyday i wake up and am grateful i’m not a kings fan lmfaoooYou deserve the suffering @SacramentoKingsThe Sacramento Kings have been dealing with players who refuse to workout with them during the draft process, as well as players who try to get the fuck out of Sacramento. 

The kings get a guy who wants to play in Sac, wants to fix the franchise, and the Kings say “fuck off”. 😞It’s hard being  a Sacramento Kings fanhow am I supposed to finish malmkrog when I'm angry at the sacramento kings for trading tyrese haliburtonSacramento Kings. WTF!!!!!!! https://t.co/bfcf8rUiYh@ColeyMick Death, taxes, and the Sacramento Kings doing dumb shitTyrese Halliburton is an absolute stud. Why in the world would you trade that kid. The #SacramentoKings have to be up there as the worst franchise in professional sports.I’m sick to my stomach, why do you keep doing this to me @SacramentoKings https://t.co/X8fsmOXV1X“I’m a member of the Sacramento Kings so I’m gonna help fix this”

Tyrese Haliburton was ALL IN on the Kings 😔 (h/t @AhnFireDigital) https://t.co/LMu3FpZKWRSacramento Kings, a NBA team or a money laundering venture?The Sacramento Kings are the biggest poverty franchise in North American sports atpAt this point move the Sacramento Kings to Seattle. 😭😭😭@SacramentoKings @CacheCreekCR You don't deserve loveThat Sacramento Kings trade is so crazy, they need to change the Capitol of California back to Vallejo like it used to be…

☕️😎🤚@statmuse @SacramentoKings They’re going to regret giving him up Nbs@Bounc5ack9800 In comparison to Simmons no lol but for the Kings yeah I don’t mind it. I don’t think anyone was happier to draft Hali than me but he been this good. He can grow a bit and he’s a damn good piece for a winner. Sacramento wasn’t gonna be that tho lol@TyHaliburton22 @SacramentoKings You can always come home!

Shame they can’t trade with each other, love to see the Kangz give up half their roster for Jimmy Anderson and Jack Leach’s bird rights.Quick, tweet something about the Lakers to make your fans forget about trading away Haliburton!! @SacramentoKingsNot happy at all.

Tyrese Haliburton is one of the most likable players to land in Sacramento in years. Domantas Sabonis is a 25-year-old two-time All-Star. Kings need to make sure he stays beyond two years, which means they aren't done revamping roster.@Jerichoooo @SacramentoKings @mmcnair I’m sad for y’all, Halli is a bucket@Jo_GotGame @NBA @SacramentoKings Yep. Not feeling it but I guess they love Davion.@CharlesFromWork @DragonflyJonez As someone born in Sacramento, unfortunately, the kings are very real. I’ve watched them in Arco arena, sleep train arena and now Golden 1 center. My first sports memory was my dad taking me to a kings raptors game, kings lost, fans threw tons of shit onto the court lmaooo@justtucckker @SacramentoKings You can watch him in Indy with me 🤷🏼‍♂️Sabonis won’t be in Sacramento yet, so Kings will be extra shorthanded against the Timberwolves tonight.@nbatrend @SacramentoKings Welcome@Boards2Buckets @SacramentoKings @ChewieWoolf @bflewis3 @gold35rush @bpierce5 Also, are we sure our dumb franchise wasn’t convinced they were getting two of the same player? Can’t rule it out@nataliethehero @SacramentoKings I just hope De'Aaron and Davion back court (which is small AF) works for y'all. Y'all gonna need a better backup bigger guard/wing than Jeremy Lamb.COME OUTSIDE RN @SacramentoKings @mmcnair @Vivek https://t.co/UKfm74YBSWFUCK YOU @SacramentoKings the whole organization, VIVEK, MONTE. Like we are seriously the worst “SPORTS” franchise ever. I’m done . Never again am I turning the TV to watch this teamI am really disappointed in you @SacramentoKingsI am moving to Sacramento in a few months. 

The Kings are making it hard to be a new fan.@BucknerBurner They just let us put Duarte and Halliburton on the same back court lmaooo. L + ratio + poverty franchise @SacramentoKingsThe Sacramento Kings are the definition of Poverty Franchise.I think I have it rough as a Panthers fan but then I look at the Sacramento Kings franchise and it puts things in perspective for me.Unfortunate but the Kings are pinning their hope on Davion Mitchell. #Kings #Sacramento #NBATradeDeadline https://t.co/hVYezwZXHuConsensus Line Move:

Dude plays like monta Ellis@BalaPattySZN @str8zedge @SacramentoKings I’d take SGA over Bagley tbhThat the Sacramento Kings are a money laundering scheme https://t.co/EgWGCbDMJGGood things there is no such thing as Sacramento Kings fans. I’d be flipping out over the Halliburton trade.To be clear, Sabonis and Fox could be a long term fit for the Kings. Sacramento is making this move expecting that to be the case.

My point is, you expect results from that pair NOW! There's no excuse like the one you had with a Fox/Haliburton future.Random question: how many swear words am I allowed to put in a tweet before Twitter deletes it? Asking for a friend…..

#sacramentokings #NBA #tradedeadline https://t.co/4KP9BHISScIf you are a fan of Portland or Sacramento Kings. I am deeply sorry.

If you are a fan of the Lakers that didn't want Russell Westbrook and that wanted Caruso over THT.

You trade the team and city of Sacramento's brightest star in a win now move?

Too much money.I HATE YOU @SacramentoKings@Boards2Buckets @SacramentoKings @ChewieWoolf @bflewis3 @gold35rush @bpierce5 To be clear, hating this trade has everything to do with giving up Hali. I actually really like Sabonis, Lamb and Holiday. But giving up Hali is a killer and is another short sighted move in a long string of them by this franchise.Sacramento Kings certified crack smokers@TyHaliburton22 @SacramentoKings Going to miss you King. You really were my favorite Kings player since CWebb, glad you get a fresh start with a team that values how great of a player you are.Petition to move the Sacramento Kings to Seattle and rename them the Sonics, also fire everyone on the team.I’m taking a leave of absence from being a @SacramentoKings fan@Less_HumbleTeej There is no way the Sacramento Kings are a real NBA franchise.

Seems like they’re renting him for a season before they’re forced to trade him b/c why the fuck would he stay in Sacramento with no Haliburton there??Ay I'm not gon lie, the NBA might need to force Sacramento to sell the Kings. Move them niggas to Seattle.Rare W for the Kings…

Tyrese was the sliver of light at the end of a 20 year tunnel of pitch black and they trade him to make the play in 🤣no way the sacramento kings aren’t a front for money laundering at this pointMight have to throw my @SacramentoKings blanket away after this. Unbelievable.Everyone to the @SacramentoKings front office rn https://t.co/fT67AGZpyNThe Sacramento Kings traded away their entire future in Tyrese Haliburton for what? 6 extra wins😭Big L @SacramentoKings 

@TyHaliburton22 isn’t an player you just move. That dude is different. Cut his teeth with #CyclONEnation. On his way to being a superstar in this league. SMH. https://t.co/9caKIi8p2J@wojespn @SacramentoKings I have never been high on Haliburton. Coming out of the draft I thought his ceiling could be Malcolm Brogdon. Both high IQ players that can do a little bit of everything. Haliburton is a little more athletic than Brogdon but Brogdon is a better scorer. We will see though…You done f’d up today, @SacramentoKings 

This hurts.

@TyHaliburton22Can’t believe the Kings actually chose Fox over Haliburton 

Also feel bad for Sabonis being traded to SacramentoThe #Pacers' Domantas Sabonis, Justin Holiday, Jeremy Lamb and a 2027 second-round pick have reportedly been traded to the Sacramento Kings in exchange for Tyrese Haliburton, Buddy Hield and Tristan Thompson, according to ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski. https://t.co/GzkNWbdiTdThe #Pacers' Domantas Sabonis, Justin Holiday, Jeremy Lamb and a 2027 second-round pick have reportedly been traded to the Sacramento Kings in exchange for Tyrese Haliburton, Buddy Hield and Tristan Thompson, according to ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski. https://t.co/mZdbJFkAA4@arielhelwani From a Kings fan Ariel, it's stupid.

The Sacramento Kings are hella dumb@Rayrayman916 @SacramentoKings Shoulda traded fox 🤣fully convinced the sacramento kings gm is three kids in a trench coat@strobesglow @SacramentoKings not even god can help themThe newest member of the Sacramento Kings: Domantas Sabonis 

(via @wojespn) https://t.co/J2k529QzSxThe Sacramento Kings need to hire me as GMI think I could’ve gotten behind a Sacramento deal like this if it had been for Ben Simmons. Just not Sabonis. 

As much as I love him, I just don’t see Sabonis elevating that team very much this year, or the future. #KingsSacramento Kings 😂Fuck you @SacramentoKings WHY MY BOI BUDDY.Sacramento Kings got FINESSED!!!@SacramentoKings @CacheCreekCR I am so sorry for anyone here who is a fan of this team.Kings of Comedy, Kings of Leon sure, hell even King of Queens. But the Sacramento Kings? https://t.co/FKjqvDfyGB https://t.co/r06OjFpq5uWhat is @SacramentoKings doing ? 🤯@KrispyFlakes2k I just don't see the hype for Sabonis, he is a big who can't protect the rim and can't shoot. Trading away your best young player for a chance at the play in seems like well a Sacramento Kings move.@SacramentoKings And he’s gone… why would we do this to ourselves?Pacers gaining Tyrese Haliburton and a trade chip in Buddy Hield yeah they def won the trade idk wtf the Sacramento kings was smoking on@SacramentoKings traded one of the three players on this team that actually play like they care every night.

Will De’Aaron Fox be next now? Davion Mitchell is waiting in the wings to take over in Sacramento. #Kings #NBAI really feel for Sacramento Kings fans. Your team did it right. They nailed a draft pick in Tyrese Haliburton. And then traded him away within 2 years.@MikeShiftyy @statmuse @SacramentoKings First overall pick don’t come easy baby. He gon pick up Chet holmgren next year@SacramentoKings 

My name is Isaiah P. Williams... I have been a faithful Kings fan since kindergarten (Currently 26yo). Through an abusive relationship, I have sat by your side in hopes to see you grow n change.

My Sacramento Kings: hold my drinkWho the fuck woke up this morning and said I’m going to trade Sabonis for Halliburton and Hield 🤢 #sacramentokings@ASaltyLucio @RagingBull424 @Greenbelt23 @statmuse @SacramentoKings The kings were going to lose for the foreseeable future anyway they probably should have given Fox instead of Haliburton but They have needed a PF for a long time and they got one of the best in the league.@HenryTheBlasian Sacramento had an abundance of PGs with no bigs. Sucks to give up Tyrese, but they need a big man. Now, adding Buddy Hield and getting Jeremy Lamb in return is sickening if I’m a kings fanThe Sacramento Kings are the Texans of the NBA  😭😭😭 https://t.co/Nas8JAZBpU@SynergyFlynn @synjimmy @SacramentoKings honestly not surprised from the kings"I'm a member of the Sacramento Kings so I'm gonna help fix this.

Lord, what a dumpster fire https://t.co/mi5wUqjkVOHey @SacramentoKings, you are winning if you think the point of the game is to be terrible and piss off all of your fans.Pretty sure this won’t be the only move @SacramentoKings make, but we overall got more talent in return. Buddy has been playing like shit for two years and Tristan’s Thompson might not even be in the league next year. Only thing that hurts is Haliburton. https://t.co/FI0ZPbsXH9Abolish the Sacramento kingsI was today years old when I learned that the Sacramento Kings had that many vocal fans. #sarcasm #sorryabouttyrese #congratspacers@SacramentoKings y’all good?@TyHaliburton22 @SacramentoKings Bye, man.

You didn’t get immediately better, or a least not enough to make any impact this season, then you trade your trending upward pieces for descending pieces?

I can no longer be a fan.@MarcJSpears Tweet should say “promoted by Sacramento Kings Ownership”The Sacramento kings are such a poverty franchiseThat’s it. I am done being a fan of the Sacramento Kings. I have sat through decades of no playoff appearances, watching them draft Bagley over Luka only to see future star Haliburton traded to Indiana.

Winner in all this is @Pacers getting My guy @TyHaliburton22 and Buddy in this deal. #nbatrade@therealjulzzz_ @SacramentoKings No picks or anything. Tired of holding on to this hope of sneaking in as the last seed of the playoff only to get swept. Commit to an actual rebuild (not just being bad but gaining young talent) and fix the damn culture of the team. We deserve so much better than this shitty team@nbatrend @SacramentoKings W thenHey @Pacers @SacramentoKings since you guys are selling your teams the @celtics will take Harrison Barnes, Marvin bagley, Malcom brogdon, and Myles turner off your hands.Sacramento Kings really just did that@nbatrend @SacramentoKings I fell to my knees in Class bro…..Im trying to stay happy but I don’t know how much I can take it anymore I may just go back to The Celtics full time this is Disgusting@ARodCA1 @SacramentoKings Well…@johno_H @SacramentoKings @Athletics Basically.Move the Sacramento Kings to Seattle please ...

Look at the talent the Browns have had since they returned in 99. They’ve had some lately but other than that the whole organization has been garbage. But as far as the Kings you’re right. It’s just a cycle with them get good talent trade it, fire the coach.Sacramento Kings honestly need new ownership and a relocation.

This kills us man @TyHaliburton22 i know you’re gonna kill it everywhere you king.As much as people really hate the fact that Sacramento trade Halliburton away, the kings had a rotation of three PGs and it was getting crowded. Getting Sabonis while defining your PG spot isn’t a bad trade. Adding Buddy Hield is what makes the trade terrible@SacramentoKings Pacers legendWhy do Sacramento got a NBA team ? Send the kings to The louWe'll give you Enes and a second for Barnes @SacramentoKingsTraded away the only good thing going for them SMH @SacramentoKingsas a lifelong Sacramento Kings fan, i am salivating at the thought of Sabonis and Kristaps Porzingis together 

make it happen @SacramentoKings@SLAMonline @wojespn i didn't expect this AT ALL. if anything i thought Sacramento was going to trade Fox or Mitchell or both because of how good Haliburton has been doing. i think Buddy will lowkey look nice in a pacers jersey but i can't even imagine sabonis in a kings jersey. this is crazyThe Sacramento Kings are retardedYo the @SacramentoKings always make some of the DUMBEST trades. They make it so hard to be a fan. Trading @TyHaliburton22 though? One of the worse moves in an extensive history of horrible trades.

I don’t see how we dish Halliburton after he showcased his potential all season. If anything he was suppose to be a pillar…. https://t.co/voZMTIIPfASACRAMENTO KINGS

Fox was averaging 25&amp; 7 last season and you telling me you would trade Fox then Haliburton !? Last time we had a walking 20&amp;10 it was Cousins ? And who else was on the team !? We’ve never surrounded Fox with the right pieces it’s time to do it now !?Kings trading Halliburton makes no sense. Sacramento(technically Roseville) deserves betterSacramento Kings fans.....oofI'm just gonna say it, the Sacramento Kings stink.why do u hate ur fans. this is a toxic relationship @SacramentoKingsThe Sacramento Kings will never be in the Playoffs again, I think that's something we all agree on.@wojespn Awfully bad trade for the Sacramento why the fuck would you trade Halliburton wtf are the "kings" doing right now?!?Holy shit, what are Sacramento Kings doing!?@aFewTooMany_Pod @JacobJgilman2 Yeah but now it’ll be for America’s Team, the Sacramento Kings@SacramentoKings this why y’all ain’t been hot since Bibby &amp; Webber@ASaltyLucio @Greenbelt23 @statmuse @SacramentoKings Anyone can have 10 good games.

Can't believe they chose Fox over Hali another 10 years of darkness for Kings fans #sacramentokings #NBATradeDeadline https://t.co/CXKDgr2zgMYou are dumb @SacramentoKings https://t.co/JQqHnPVEGSBtw, Sabonis a great player. But the Kings gave up way too much for him.

To summarize: The Sacramento Kings are fucking stupidSacramento Kings’ GM https://t.co/faa5uLrkhHThey have to liquidate the Sacramento Kings franchise@SacramentoKings Yall had one jobIt wouldn’t be Sacramento if they didn’t trade their top young talent away… Haliburton literally had 17 assists the other night. He’s 21 years old in his second year. However, the Sabonis fit around Fox is likely what appealed to the Kings. https://t.co/UtlUEIroibChicago Bears: “We are the worst run franchise in pro-sports!”

Woj has the details of the six-player trade 📲 https://t.co/9nKmhL6wNU@SacramentoKings Lmao good job fellasI go eat lunch and the Sacramento Kings lose their fucking minds.@SacramentoKings it’s been a hell of a ride all the best with your and your awful dogshit franchise@WorldWideWob At this point , the @SacramentoKings don't know what they are doing or what they wantI can’t believe that the NBA installed a Colangelo into Philly for shamelessly tanking but haven’t done to same for Sacramento for being the Kings@KingsF4N @SacramentoKings nah i’m gone idgaf@SacramentoKings all time LThe Sacramento Kings have to be the worst run organization when it comes to talent evaluation in all of sports.@mspears96 @SacramentoKings 😂😂🤣🤣😂😂 “YOLO” .. lmao..Why would the Kings give up Haliburton and Hield for Sabonis? That’s the kind of trade a contender makes, not the Kings. I love Sabonis, but Sacramento should be building around Haliburton and developing, not going for it when you’re not even the 10-seed.As a lifelong Sacramento Kings fan, since 1030 am PST this morning, I am very excited.@willarchambault @SacramentoKings Or just… why?I’m so stunned that the @SacramentoKings moved on from Halliburton. Just a cursed franchise. #Kings fans I’m legitimately sorry that @Vivek owns your team. Just god awful.I see the @SacramentoKings are back to doing what the Kings do best and dealing Hali"I'm a member of the Sacramento Kings so I'm gonna help fix this. It ain't gonna be in a day but ima be here and we're gonna make it work I promise that."

- Tyrese Haliburton last month 😢

The Indiana Pacers are trading two-time All-Star big man Domantas Sabonis to the Sacramento Kings for a package that will include second-year guard Tyrese Hali...Remember this day when Tyrese Haliburton is a STAR, yet another one the @SacramentoKings get rid of. I hope they know what they're doing, but history says they dont.This was the most excited about the Sacramento Kings since... I dunno drafting Fox I guess? 
And now he's already gone. https://t.co/z5CUvNJvLL@SacramentoKings @CacheCreekCR poverty@SacramentoKings please hire me. clearly you need better basketball opinions.@MarcJSpears Did the Sacramento Kings write this?Man. Not @TyHaliburton22.

Fuck everything. Fuck it all to death.Do it you cowards @SacramentoKings https://t.co/WdHh5fuxYqThe Kings Front Office should be drug tested for making such a preposterous move. Also, why weren’t the Knicks in on Haliburton if Sacramento made it clear he wasn’t untouchable in talks? This also probably means that Randle isn’t getting dealt. Disappointed, but not surprised.@SacramentoKings stupid cuntThe Sacramento Kings are dumb as hell man"Let's head out to the phone line...

You’ve been my favorite @SacramentoKings player since they drafted you. We appreciate everything you’ve done for the team.Damn @SacramentoKings idk how I feel yet about this tradePlease get new owners @SacramentoKings@bennyhorowitz1 No one knows a Sacramento Kings fan. I'm not entirely convinced that the team isn't a Mandela effect thing.THE SACRAMENTO KINGS ARE DOING THEIR BEST SACRAMENTO KINGS THAT'S FOR SURE@JabariDavisNBA That's a lot of Lamb. Hopefully they included some mint jelly on the side. @wojespn @SacramentoKings @Pacers@SacramentoKings @mmcnair @Vivek blood is on your handsNot quite sure what to make of the Kings-Pacers blockbuster trade. Sabonis rocks but trading an elite 21-year-old up-and-comer like Haliburton is SO foolish. Just an odd trade tbh, which is very on-brand for Sacramento. IMO, the Sixers should've made a Simmons-Hali base deal work@SacramentoKings fans please just stay cool. This trade was the ONLY real move you could make. Fox doesn’t have any trade value. Neither does Bagley. Hali was all you had. Let that young man go somewhere and live. Now you can move forward. This is good. For everybody. 😊👍🏿You all are shocked that the SACRAMENTO KINGS would make bad basketball decisions?

Have you not seen what they are the last 15 years?The Sacramento Kings are the Alabama football of ruining careers. No one better.Yeah, to Seattle y’all must go @SacramentoKings https://t.co/XshlK2KpisHow are the Sacramento Kings a franchise in the NBA 😂the sacramento kings said hop in we're starting another two-decade long playoff drought@lilicefroze @SacramentoKings They gotta make another trade or something@nbatrend @SacramentoKings At least buddy is gone 👍🏽@SacramentoKings WHAT THE FUCK?!?!?The sacramento kings and the portland trailblazers making trades rn https://t.co/xU8hAG2mWT@Kurt_coVain @StepIntoMyZone I agree the Kings are wild and this doesn't make sense to me. I like the potential Fox and Sabonis combo but I dont think Sabonis is going to want to stay or re up in Sacramento so I don't get it at all.🚨TRADE ALERT🚨

Sacramento Kings Receive;
Domantas Sabonis
Jeremy Lamb
Justin Holiday 

Indiana Pacers Receive: 
Tyrese Hailburton
Buddy Hield

Oh well.Move the Kings to Seattle bro. The fuck is happening in Sacramento https://t.co/Dik18UsbkYI know Sacramento is going to be upset about losing out on Haliburton, he has major upside (obviously) but understand that the Kings traded for an All-Star in Sabonis and also received good role players in Lamb and Holiday. This is something Kings fans should be excited about.@EROCKhd @SacramentoKings As a pacers fan I agree fuck you kings for getting Domasi’m still shocked, there’s no way the sacramento kings just traded away …

Seeing the Sacramento Kings be the worse franchise in the NBA and not the Knicks! https://t.co/PryplWMuBGThe Sacramento kings owner should be forced to sell his team and fire the GM and move the team to Cincinnati, Baltimore , Seattle or San Diego.

UNREAL. 😳The Domas-Kings trade is a huge L for Sacramento, Sabonis won’t get the Kings far and is not a superstar. Trading Haliburton who hasn’t just showed flashes but has truly shown superstar potential will surely be a laughable move when we look back on it.Sacramento Kings:
"Ok guys let's do the highly successful Boogie Cousins era again but white" https://t.co/Wqq9fUSGMBAll of #ripcity thanks the #Sacramento #kings for taking the focus away from the #blazers right now! https://t.co/6At02MV31S@brawadis @SacramentoKings haliburton, but then also they gave up Buddy!!!How is the Sacramento Kings a better situation for Sabonis ? Do players have any say so ? I refuse to believe he felt this would be better ..@CrannkedLive @SacramentoKings Halliburton has star potential and Sabonis makes no sense unless they think him and Fox can contend together. Which is a yikes imoYou are not Kings you are Queens @SacramentoKings https://t.co/z3O2E6WTu8@brawadis @SacramentoKings You should come with @romelattaie to the suns vs kings game here in sacramentoIt must suck being a fan of the Sacramento Kings.@SacramentoKings I can offer you a slightly used Dwight Powell for HolmesStupid is as stupid (continuously) does - Sacramento Kings 🥴 https://t.co/lfiSVb7rI6The Sacramento Kings will forever be poverty.

Not sure Sabonis helps them run.

If you love Sabonis, you need shooting. Sacramento traded its two best shooters for Sabonis.

This trade is so Kings.The @SacramentoKings are soooo dumb. No way they traded one of their best players for Sabonis , just crazy@whiskeytacomatt @SacramentoKings What I miss@JordanZirm What is the Sacramento Kings doing they didn't make themselves better sabonis is a good player but come on you didn't get no draft picks for buddy hield@KingzGirl22 @SacramentoKings What happened?@ryanteston @young_quince @statmuse @SacramentoKings Seems badIf I was a Sacramento Kings fan … I’d stop being that immediately.wait huh?! the #Kings traded Haliburton?!! 🤔 .. wtf!! being a Sacramento fan gotta be rough https://t.co/ug5zjLJmgO@sdpimienta @SacramentoKings @mmcnair Welcome 🤝 #DubNationSacramento Kings will be moved to Seattle after that trade.Just reminding everyone the Sacramento kings drafted Marvin Bagley over Luka doncic and Trae young

I wouldn’t mind being the GM and making trades after wtf you guys just did..Wtf are you guys doing? @SacramentoKingsI had a strong feeling the Sacramento Kings would do something big. I thought they’d offer multiple firsts for Domantas Sabonis but looks like Tyrese Haliburton will be enough.

Clearly would rather pair Fox with an all star level big than young talent in Tyrese. Honestly big for Indy to get him.

We’ll see though maybe Sacramento just wants to dump him.@SandraHelena39 @montecoman @gabriel67891734 @ahf77118198 @Hagbard_Dane @dovesandletters @TZidanista @Zenfucius @SacramentoKings @goonerdave66 @ChristineEliaz @laflemm12 @larkin_robertl @HopeInTheUSA @MehniG @spacefly369 @Cuervo3 @rezvan_3 @RunestenConsult @4dorthe @mazzenilsson @kjellerupbiz @__P__M__C__ Oh yes sorry, I removed my comment@TimMaxwell22 If true and he helps the Kings win playoff games, he will be only the second player drafted by them that you can say that about in the entire Sacramento era.

Now us fans have to suffer for Lebron James's quest for BIG NAME PLAYERS regardless of team fit.@warriors Never seen players own franchises like Curry owns the Houston Rockets and Portland Trail Blazers as well as Klay Thompson owns Sacramento Kings and Oklahoma City Thunder.
