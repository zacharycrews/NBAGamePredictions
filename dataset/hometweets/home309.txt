For the push to tap more into the #MFFL and @kporzee is a quality dude not to mention a quality player @dallasmavs https://t.co/NcsPEXWHRt@1DJFirstClass @dallasmavs Period run him his shit 😂😂😂Jamie Foxx Said He Need A 10 Min Contract 😅 @dallasmavs https://t.co/LcwLNfo7YD@MrChrisArnold @All_Things_Mavs @kporzee @dallasmavs @krussellcbs11 My takeaway from this interview is that the reports about Luka/KP relationship being ‘shaky’ last season was true as KP said they were up and down in the past. Glad to hear they are on good terms now though@MrChrisArnold @kporzee @dallasmavs @krussellcbs11 Thanks Chris!   Fell asleep before I was able to catch this last night.@Melvin_Royal8 @kporzee @dallasmavs @krussellcbs11 What KP said matched up w everything i knew &amp; heard. I also appreciated his realizing "you gotta play great &amp; win" if you have a max contract. &amp; his goal is the championship.@MrChrisArnold @kporzee @dallasmavs @krussellcbs11 Great interview...lots of qualifying statements of how his relationship with Luka is a good "now," they communicate, "now," etc. Seems to subtly hint at past regime being part of the schism?

Holmes would really help them out and he fits the Mavs TPE. #MFFLThe cavaliers are in Dallas to play the mavericks tonight. 

They’re kinda funky; they are 10-8, lead their division, but have a negative point differential. (The Cavs are +.02 as their 10-10 record and litany of close games would suggest) 

They also have Luka.
