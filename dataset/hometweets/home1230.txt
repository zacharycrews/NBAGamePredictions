#LetEmKnow #NetsWorld https://t.co/hXxGVfWvMsThe Nets have the third-shortest NBA 🏆 odds (+700) despite needing to advance out of this week's Play-In Tournament to make the playoffs. 

11% of the 💰 (and 10% of all futures bets) are backing Brooklyn to take the title. https://t.co/f3G3DrW274.@OvieSoko believes the additional game to play will only help the Brooklyn Nets find their playoff momentum 📈

But they have to get there first.

Nets over Cavaliers. Brooklyn with the advantage even if both teams are healthy. Without Jarrett Allen, Cleveland almost doesn't give have a chance. 

Clippers over Timberwolves. I feel like LA's experience comes through here.@CoreyBCantor @aaronkpatel @BrooklynNets He nervously DMs me all game though@TriggaThirty @BrooklynNets @sdotcurry @AndreDrummond @KDTrey5 You are jobless@Goated72914765 @Rileyshoemaker0 @BrooklynNets Them bucks 🥲The play-in tournament tips off tonight when the Cleveland Cavaliers (+375) travel to Brooklyn to battle the Nets (-8.5)

🏀Cleveland is 3-9 ATS in their last 12 games
🏀Brooklyn is 4-1 SU in their last 5 games
🏀The total has gone over in 5 of the last 7 games in this matchup https://t.co/T3eM5anlxPBrooklyn Nets vs. Cleveland Cavaliers @ 7PM

Cavs All-Star Jarrett Allen is still out with an injury, which is a huge defensive blow to the Cavs. Mobley will need a huge game. 

The Nets will have KD and Kyrie well rested and should be the heavy favorites to win.

Williams being hurt would lessen that challengeI think the Heat &amp; Nets should both be favoured over Toronto if they meet in Round #2.

The Nets may well even be the better team. 

But with Kyrie out 4 games in T.O. &amp; Simmons's fate still uncertain, I think they are also *BY FAR* the more likely to implode.

Tatum could easily bring his 27 ppg down to 24-25 and get an extra assist and rebound &amp; have better stats in every area. But he doesn’t need to.PLAY-IN GAME!

#BrooklynTogetherI can’t imagine how people take the subway in NYC everyday. Used to take it all the time especially heading to Brooklyn from Jersey.

https://t.co/EeEiaFZ157Who do #brooklynnets play if we beat the #CavaliersI can't see the @BrooklynNets losing tonight, but it's curious why the opening line was only -8. It's since gone up to 10 in some spots, which is much closer to what I thought it would be. Still, a curious opening number

And I hardly bet them the last 30+ games, but FWIW- Cavs did not cover in 9 of last 12 overall &amp; in 6 of last 7 on road. Slumping.

@BrooklynNets is 20-21 at home, @cavs is 19-22 on the road. Nets won the last matchup with an 11 point lead. 

@atlanta defend home well, 27-14, and @hornets play good in away games, 21-20. CHA won the last match, 116-106. https://t.co/HYCNEQLL4z@prembry @BelieverBit @GillianMWong @Raptors @celtics @BrooklynNets @sixers It’s actually sad. Raptors fans are the worst in the NBA I swear. They win one ring and act like they’re the best things to walk the earth. One lucky ring at that. Would’ve been a gentleman’s sweep if KD was playing.🏀#NBA schedule preview(13/04)

Cleveland has cratered after a blistering start, losing 7 of their last 10. 
Brooklyn finished the season winning 4 in a row including an 11 point W over the Cavs.

Please play any playoff series without Vanvleet or Siakam and you get swept. 🤣🤦🏾‍♂️Per Sources: Darius Garland (Concussion Protocol) alongside Jarrett Allen (Rehabbing Fractured Finger) will both be OUT for Tuesdays game against the Brooklyn Nets. #MetaQuestPlayIn #Nets #Cavs@WoWTwoMelons @GillianMWong @Raptors @celtics @BrooklynNets @sixers So playing the nets then the bucks back to back series is less exhausting than the raptors &amp; Heat? Lol y’all say anything.@GillianMWong @Raptors @celtics @BrooklynNets @sixers 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 literally delusional. Leave it up to raptors fans to not have any logic.@brewcitypaul The C's game started later.
