Besides there’s reason Mavs gave up on him so quickly. He’s off to a good start now with the blazers but it’s nothing spectacularGAME THEORY PODCAST: @DannyLeroux is here, and we break down the messy Portland Trail Blazers, who just fired their GM and have the worst defense in the NBA. Then, we do Buy/Sell/Hold on the middle of the West.

SPOTIFY: https://t.co/i7hBOfgTBu https://t.co/oXqx0gublW@Hunt3rsaurus @BMBTPodcast @trailblazers Teams are most desperate around the deadline. Contenders want to integrate new pieces for the Playoffs. I think Lillard is gone and as soon as that happens, the entire roster is sold to the highest bidder OKC style.The @LAClippers and @trailblazers look to get back to winning ways as they clash in Portland tomorrow. ⚔️
