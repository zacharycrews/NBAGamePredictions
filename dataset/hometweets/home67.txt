Three points is 50% more than 2 points. So even if the player makes slightly fewer of his 3-point shot attempts than of his 2-point shot attempts, he can still end up scoring more overall points by shooting more 3-pointers.Chicago bulls first quarter -120

I'm really proud to be the guy who did that dirty work for the Chicago Bulls.” - Joakim Noah.@chicagobulls @Bluerock2041 @JoakimNoah For what?The @chicagobulls play today! That means another couple of Ws tonight!

Stay tuned for that, as well as a potential for a play on tonight’s #NFL game, as well as other #NBA games! #GamblingTwitter@Teddymaciswack @chicagobulls Man that looks like a PARTY last night, good crew came out@adamk55 @chicagobulls Nope. Rather see the franchise fold, than see that guy in the green and white.@chicagobulls @JoakimNoah @MisterCBooz Be still my heart 🥰🥰🥰🥰"When you look at the record books for the Chicago Bulls, I'm number 1 for offensive rebounds. That's dirty work shit. You have to have some demons to go get that one. I'm really proud to be the guy who did that dirty work for the Chicago Bulls."
 - Joakim Noah told @ZachLowe_NBA@Fate_35 @RodimusHot @Hooptalk365 @chicagobulls @ZachLaVine We agree that through evolution of "the shot", the success rate at making 3s has improved from then to now. In the 90s, the 3pt shot wasn't the focus so players didn't practice this shot as much as they did w/ inside shooting. Today's its completely different.not sure why they aren’t retiring it… kinda hoping they surprise him tonight saying they’re retiring it… do it @chicagobulls !!! https://t.co/gfIoySbn7Y@chicagobulls @JoakimNoah Are they just honoring him or is his jersey going into the rafters?@chicagobulls @JoakimNoah This is one of the most beautiful things I’ve ever seen in MY LIFE@ClutchPage @yemeksepeti Chicago Bulls@chicagobulls @TheRealHinrich @JoakimNoah Kirk is starting to look like Cutty@ZachLowe_NBA interviewing @JoakimNoah is making my whole week.

I'm saying, it's much easier to shoot &amp; make a basket w/ higher FG efficiency. The bonus of just 1pt diff for a deeper shot w/ a lower success rate of making the basket wasn't practices as much in the day.I’m so damn excited for Chicago Bulls basketball….. so this is fun?Free NBA Picks (10/28/21) - New York Knicks vs Chicago Bulls Prediction https://t.co/Wbw7BnPPJH via @YouTube
