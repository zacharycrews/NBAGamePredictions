No Gobert, no Gay. 

That makes it nine straight games for Gobert and three straight for Gay.

#TakeNote | @kslsportsMy hope is that the Utah Jazz sent Joe Ingles to recruit Dame.Utah Jazz General Manager Justin Zanik said the front office looked at many options, including dealing future first-round picks for established veterans, but settled on the deal they did because other returns weren‚Äôt worth the cost.

Thank you folks.

2 new Utah videos coming soon. One might as well be called "The Utah Jazz Comedy Special" https://t.co/LaKNJ5cnlfhey go follow Donavan and not only because he understands that Arby‚Äôs is good but also because he‚Äôs doing cool, important stuff for @utahjazz https://t.co/tnmcnUAYBhAfter the Warriors got the 9th win, I looked at the next five games before the #NBAAllStar break and felt we should at least get wins against Utah Jazz and the Knicks. Winless against both sides, #DubNation face the 2 teams from LA next.üò©

https://t.co/myPM3ZPpzf@HitTheGlass @HugYourLove @utahjazz Agreed, but that‚Äôs not what I said nor what I responded to@DaBay4LF @IceColdKiller95 @GoIdenState @warriors this is such a flawed mentality, the utah jazz had the best record for like 3 years yet they‚Äôve come short in the playoffs because of the from office inability to add perimeter defense. You can be a top seed and still have a huge exploitable flaw in the playoffs.@utahjazz @aaronhancock14 One of the best players to ever come out of the University of Evansville! Rest easy Jerry!SBP is not giving up hope that Utah Jazz guard Jordan Clarkson can play for Gilas Pilipinas as a local in the FIBA World Cup 2023 so as @iamMVP.

https://t.co/eFPZWO9oia https://t.co/UMjb8gTkgW@utahjazz are a joke, trading the heart of their team to Portland‚Ä¶. You won‚Äôt see a conference final for ten years. Confused and disappointed in what I thought was a quality organization.@ahunqhimself @NBA @utahjazz The officials and even the reaction of the defender seem to disagree. Sooo, there‚Äôs that.  However, I do agree the arm was extended, just not in a way that added a competitive advantage‚Ä¶ in other words, he cooled him without needing a push.@EnesFreedom Wishing you nothing but the best.  You see the big picture, your activism is to be commended it speaks volumes about your character and the kind of human that you are.  Would love to have you back in a @utahjazz uniform. #TakeNote#Utah #Jazz: Sunday Dinner: ...

#TakeNote https://t.co/M6ZmftxWss@utahjazz You love to see it.@hereforsportUoU @Ben_In_Utah @utahjazz I guess that makes sense. Do you know how far above the tax they are. Because I don‚Äôt get why they took him. I guess get as many big wings as you can@Joeingles7 We will miss you, Joe! @utahjazz@CactusRedsOgden @utahjazz I think possibly, but I have no intel.@UtahPuntTeam @Ben_In_Utah @utahjazz I think I heard his contract isn‚Äôt guaranteed next year though@RakannnnnnnW @utahjazz Makes sense.
