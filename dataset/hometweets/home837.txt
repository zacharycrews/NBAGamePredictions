So the jazz game will be tolerable to listen to 😅😅😅#utahjazz@utahjazz @NickeilAW PLEASE TAKE CARE OF HIM AND MAKE HIM COMFORTABLEThe Jazz seem very relaxed in their layup lines. Taking circus shots and alley-oops. Wonder if that’s because the trade deadline has passed or because we’re playing the Magic tonight 🤔

#TakeNote #UtahJazz #NBA75 #3555@utahjazz So what we were told last week was not true interestingI’m loving the energy from Royce O’Neale during warmups. Drains a 3 from the logo and dance off the court

No Gobert, no Gay. 

That makes it nine straight games for Gobert and three straight for Gay.

#TakeNote | @kslsportsMy hope is that the Utah Jazz sent Joe Ingles to recruit Dame.Utah Jazz General Manager Justin Zanik said the front office looked at many options, including dealing future first-round picks for established veterans, but settled on the deal they did because other returns weren’t worth the cost.

https://t.co/myPM3ZPpzf@HitTheGlass @HugYourLove @utahjazz Agreed, but that’s not what I said nor what I responded to@DaBay4LF @IceColdKiller95 @GoIdenState @warriors this is such a flawed mentality, the utah jazz had the best record for like 3 years yet they’ve come short in the playoffs because of the from office inability to add perimeter defense. You can be a top seed and still have a huge exploitable flaw in the playoffs.@utahjazz @aaronhancock14 One of the best players to ever come out of the University of Evansville!

The Utah Jazz initial city jerseys are way better than the dark mode version.@elijahhughes4_ @utahjazz Good luck going forward. You are greatCheck out this listing I just added to my #Poshmark closet: Utah Jazz Basketball Pin. https://t.co/yOMG8i5BXc #shopmycloset @poshmarkapp@aaotw @MiniGolfWizard @utahjazz What facts that they mentioned were irrelevant? Also how can there be tons of “dead air” while also not being brief enough? While you’re at it can you say exactly whose name was mispronounced?@RustyBUCKETS321 The 2020-21 Utah Jazz (excluding playoffs)@Brandon64409750 @utahjazz They were literally the best national broadcast crew I’ve heard all year. Miles ahead of any other crew.@utahjazz @Joeingles7 Thank you @Joeingles7!@AntiRacistJazz I love listening to @bethmowins in May/June every year for #WCWS @NCAASoftball ... it's good but admittedly a little weird to hear her calling other sports! I think it's great @utahjazz was part of this historical night! I did watch the first half on @espn ...Welcome to Utah, @juanchiviris41! 

@utahjazz #TakeNote https://t.co/CApJaye89dWelcome to Utah, @NickeilAW! 

@utahjazz #TakeNote https://t.co/UM3Rn6kE88@hereforsportUoU @Ben_In_Utah @utahjazz Yeah I’m surprised that they didn’t try to get under@AustinClayton4 @utahjazz @NickeilAW 13 likes@UtahPuntTeam @Ben_In_Utah @utahjazz I’m not sure how much tax they have to pay. But right not it sounds like they saved $11m in tax. That’s probably worth it@CactusRedsOgden @utahjazz Actually going Friday… I am (unfortunately) am Orlando Magic fan.

#TakeNote https://t.co/M6ZmftxWss@utahjazz You love to see it.@hereforsportUoU @Ben_In_Utah @utahjazz I guess that makes sense. Do you know how far above the tax they are. Because I don’t get why they took him. I guess get as many big wings as you can@Joeingles7 We will miss you, Joe! @utahjazz@CactusRedsOgden @utahjazz I think possibly, but I have no intel.@UtahPuntTeam @Ben_In_Utah @utahjazz I think I heard his contract isn’t guaranteed next year though@RakannnnnnnW @utahjazz Makes sense.
