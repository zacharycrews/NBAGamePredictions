@stevejones20 Sacramento or Pels will have it, I like both options but as a 1/16 Kings fan I hope it is themAll these @SacramentoKings trade rumors are funny. Most of these sports talk show guys just speculate and start crap but really have no clue. If you tried to keep up with all the speculation it would drive you crazy. Hopefully if they make a trade it makes the team better.Shout out to the Sacramento Kings tonight playing the Pistons!!!!!🖤💜🖤💜🖤💜🖤💜🖤💜🖤💜🖤💜🖤💜🖤
#saydatden💋💄Not only does this say “Celt-
ics” which looks bad, but Pervis wasn’t drafted by the Celtics. He was drafted by the Sacramento Kings. Oops. A lot of TV stations use stock footage from years ago. I wonder if ⁦@GoCards⁩ has fixed this and other things in the Hall of Honor. https://t.co/sCu4jxFU0Z🏀 NBA 🏀

Pistons playing the 3rd game in 4 nights, kings at home and should be well rested.

https://t.co/oAwZ2e0Fno https://t.co/eWjg0zMrcKSacramento KingsSacramento Kings’ CURRENT mindset is to build their team around De’Aaron Fox, and Haliburton and will NOT move either. I think this is smart, but I also feel they should listen to offers as well, just as long as it doesn’t upset either and to do what’s best for the future #NBAThe @SacramentoKings aren't "Building around FOX"

No team wanted to give them what @mmcnair wanted for him. Because Foxs' stock was not what it was a year ago. It's DOWWWWWN!

When monte is gone, Fox will still be here.. and L's will still outnumber W's exponentially .@kennythomasnba @NBCSKings @SacramentoKings lets gooooWoah chill bruh @SacramentoKings https://t.co/sYuUjBsasn@TheHoopCentral @PompeyOnSixers That's why @SacramentoKings can't win, that is waaaay too much to be giving up.

There's no way Ben Simmons is coming to Sacramento.Worth noting that the #Kings have no interest in taking on Tobias Harris in a Ben Simmons deal, per @sam_amick 

Sacramento still believes there’s a path to acquiring Simmons, just seems tough if De’Aaron Fox isn’t included in that package https://t.co/BCteQt0P2rNot 100% sure on the translation but here’s what I got.

“The Sacramento Kings organization tried to trade De’Aaron Fox to several teams but no one said yes.” https://t.co/KATH6TTQvaThe Kings have no interest in taking back Tobias Harris in a Ben Simmons deal, a source tells @sam_amick.

Sacramento still sees a pathway to Simmons. https://t.co/un5dZ2HcKuSacramento Kings unlikely to trade De’Aaron Fox, want to build around star guard https://t.co/vMXsfbTyDr #NBA #SacramentoKings #YBY’all dumb @SacramentoKings@BAKingsNation So the 18-28 Sacramento Kings intend to keep their 2 best players but also acquire another team’s second best player — who is better than both their best players — without including either of their 2 best players.@ShamsCharania That's y they are the Sacramento Kings. Haven't made the playoffs in 15+ years in a league where more than half the league makes the playoffs every year. And u pulling players that have helped u get nowhere out of trade talks??🤣🤣🤣🤣@DenScorpioFTW Same! But my goodness, those Kings picks are a value. Especially if unprotected. I honestly think I might do this trade if it's legitimate. Unload Ben, unload Tobi's contract, aquire two 1st round picks. I'd have to root for Tisse in Sacramento.@TheChosenMoose @PurpleBuckets @TheNBACentral @PompeyOnSixers Let’s think about the future mate.

Like, just that they existed. "I just found out about them... I didn't know they played in the NBA."
I had no clue how to reactSo just to recap, the 18-28 Sacramento Kings intend to keep their 2 best players but also acquire another team’s second best player — who is better than both their best players — without including either of their 2 best players.Hearing more and more that Al Horford is the young big guru, turned Rob Williams into a near all star @SacramentoKings@SacramentoKings @corona Joke of a franchise.

I think he was last drafted by the Sacramento Kings? The country of India prayed for his success.Really not sure what the Kings plan is…

Fox visibly doesn’t want to be in Sacramento and Haliburton thrived as the main guard while Fox was out. 

Seems like a no-brainer for both sides to trade Fox and build around Hali but then again it’s the Kings we’re talking about.The Sacramento #Kings have no plans to move G De’Aaron Fox and want to construct the team around Fox and Tyrese Haliburton per the Athletic. #NBA https://t.co/SXpaXZbr9q@ShamsCharania Good one @SacramentoKings!

You’re still only getting Sabonis.ben simmons has never missed the playoffs in his career and the last time sacramento made the playoffs ben simmons was in second grade. it shouldn’t be this hard you clowns @SacramentoKings@TheHoopCentral @ShamsCharania He’s a Sacramento KingStill think Sacramento trades for Ben…..The Athletic(literally who Shams writes for) said today that Simmons is “front and center” for the Kings@ShamsCharania As a Sacramento Kings fan💜💛 i would love nothing more than if we traded Fox for Russel TOP 75 EVER Westbrook!!!!Sacramento Kings are an absolute dumpster fire right now. What the hell they doing?In todays NBA the Sacramento Kings think it’s a good idea to give up a super fast lighting quick guard who can go get you 40 for a versatile big 😂 https://t.co/DKijmzilxBKings have TWO players (Bagley and Hield) who have made it CLEAR they do not want to be here. But Monte trying as hard as he can to trade De'Aaron Fox.

They don’t know what they doing in Sacramento https://t.co/CFCx7eFXsxNow can Sacramento get Ben without giving up Fox and Hali because that would be something. Maybe a 3 team deal involving SAC/PHI/IND where Kings get Ben, Philly gets Sabonis and role players like Buddy/Lamb/Holiday/Craig etc and Indy gets players like Maxey, Bagley picks etc.Starting when I went to see them edge the @SacramentoKings last Monday cc: @ElisaAllechant https://t.co/MHR1sFGj2kThe Sacramento Kings’ current mindset is they are not trading guard De’Aaron Fox, sources tell @ShamsCharania.

➡️ Buddy Hield
➡️ Haliburton 
➡️ H. Barnes
➡️ 2 First Round Picks

Em troca os Kings queriam:

➡️ Ben Simmons

➡️ Thybulle

It pushes them more into mediocrity. That being said, forcing themselves into mediocrity is the most Kings shit everWould this team be “better” with Ben Simmons?  Absolutely - as long as you define “better” as “having a better regular season win-loss record.” If all you want from your basketball team is to NOT be the Sacramento Kings, then Ben Simmons is a great choice.👑 @SacramentoKings

Report: Kings interested in Sabonis trade, would put Fox in deal https://t.co/szx6n32dm3 via @basketballtalkBig splash or no big splash, one can only hope that the Sacramento Kings &amp; the members of the front office don't leverage more years of growth in order to finish 10th &amp; get bounced in the Play-In.

Moving De'Aaron Fox is a massive risk. Goes without saying--You HAVE to be right.sounds to me (lifelong kings fan) like we should go get julius randle from the knicks @SacramentoKings https://t.co/EM1dOPbGY5Indiana and Philly have no reason to rush into a trade, unlike the Kings.

They may as well let other teams work through deals over the next three weeks.

There’s also the factor that Sacramento is probably going to be in an even worse place in Feb and they’ll be more desperate. https://t.co/c4RHwv7sYM@YAMITHEMF @Mojo99_ My bold predictions is that the Sacramento Kings, starting off as a 10th seed, will win the play-in tournament and compete in the playoffs this season an 8th seed. And will go 5 games against the Phoenix Suns. 😁 50/50% of actually happening later in the 2021/2022 Post-Season.Why @SacramentoKings scare all the talent away? If fox leaves I’m going with him@Lakers @SacramentoKings @DetroitPistons @JeanieBuss lets get this doneBen Simmons hasn’t played a single second this NBA season and I still think he’s more relevant than any second spent playing for the Sacramento Roberta Kings.There's a new wrinkle to the Sacramento Kings' long-held interest in a Ben Simmons trade. It threatens to continue a trend of massive organizational missteps in Sactown.

#SacramentoProud | #Sixers | #NBATwitter | @getsMart_5  https://t.co/0gBlKQa7s8The Sacramento Kings seem so directionless. I don't know the style of ball they want to play, I don't understand what pieces fit where in the rumored style they want to play. I get they want a star, but what are you doing with said star.

After defeating the Sacramento Kings in 5 games in the 1st round of the 2005 Playoffs, the Seattle Supersonics 

...has won a playoff series more recently than the Sacramento Kings themselves! 🤯🤯🤯

The last time the Kings won a serie… https://t.co/R8o0SvOlCn https://t.co/z8tWNwnDlb@IvSolly @GameInjuryDoc Whoa, slowdown. The Lakers need a double-digit rebounding Center with aggressiveness deep in the paint. Lakers attacked Damian Jones constantly like they found the weakest link in Sacramento Kings defense.@jackharlow
