Just saying@memgrizz Ready for win Number 11!

Jaren is not ready to play the 5 spot.Memphis grizzlies first quarter -1@CadeCunnilingus @17tylersanders @raghav_ranga @mlwtjm @GrizzliesPR @memgrizz @Timberwolves But that depends on the player and system. Jaren fits the 5 in the Grizzlies system. Adams doesn’t deserve that spot over Jaren@grindcitymedia @McNuttMonica @memgrizz @JaMorant And to add, I'm sure he got a lot of that leadership, will and heart from the people around him. His family, mother and father. I see it every game I watch when his dad be on this sideline supporting him the way he does. I know qualities are passed on, I speak from experience💯@memgrizz Now that's loveNBA and College 🏀 Plays (1/13)

#INCREASETHEBANKROLL@YBFan76 @17tylersanders @raghav_ranga @mlwtjm @GrizzliesPR @memgrizz @Timberwolves That’s not true… he just hasn’t played the 5 because he’s been on teams with Gasol, JV, and now Adams. He fouls less and rebounds and scores at a higher level at the 5. Not to mention his defense is worlds better than slow old Adams.@samhicks615 @memgrizz Ja is me and I too am 901 I'm honored for him to rep me@drillinlooks @17tylersanders @raghav_ranga @mlwtjm @GrizzliesPR @memgrizz @Timberwolves Bro I agree with you but Steven Adams is only 28 😂😂 NBA player primes are usually 28-32@memgrizz @jarenjacksonjr why memphis is not playing this guy 30 min a night.  You are only giving 27min.  He will never be an all star.@memgrizz @NBA2K @JaMorant Well deserved@Gradyland @memgrizz @OrlandoMagic Justin and I went to Magic/Sixers game last week.

A Venezuelan icon!@GrizzHooping @memgrizz Look at his stats in 2015-16, he was amazing, having the best year of his career by a mile. I remember the offense not missing a beat with him on the court, and him defending his butt off. He was God awful after the injury tho.Taking Xavi to his 1st @memgrizz game tonight.

When he went to Memphis. It was game over for me 😂Goin to the @memgrizz game tonight https://t.co/8JvNmwqiBJ@JARonHussey I don’t know if he is saving his body this year or there is a Greg Oden situation going on here. On top of that where is he fitting in the line up? I don’t know if #JaMorant is leaving the #MemphisGrizzlies but he is considering it.

They spend a lot of time fawning over Ja Morant and the Memphis Grizzlies.In my opinion, @memgrizz Taylor Jenkins should get the coach of the year award over Chicago. Simply because the Bulls traded to stack their team, the Grizzlies traded for Adams, but otherwise did this transformation from within. #ItsaCultureThing @JaMorant @jarenjacksonjr@PetePranica @memgrizz @GrizzOnBally Go Grizz 👍🏿@Warriors_11Fan @ElSleepyFloyd @memgrizz Look who is right behind him on this new list 👀@memgrizz 😂Amazing@vannity4 @grindcitymedia @GrizNationCP @Grizz_Lead @GrizzliesFans2 @memgrizz @JaMorant Don’t worry using a players Twitter handle works as well! https://t.co/hPXdMYkB2a@memgrizz Just crawling out of bed....bottom of the morning to ya! 😏 https://t.co/zvrvIzdtJF2 Hours left!

#GrindCity #GrzNxtGen #NBA #NBATwitter@urkle9 team sport just as you lot said after your starboy lost to… lmao… the watered down memphis grizzlies in a play in game@stephenasmith @memgrizz @JaMorant Memphis needs to prove themselves in the playoffs under that pressure first before I’m sold. I’m not saying they aren’t talented. Just saying I’ve seen a lot of teams look great in regular season situations (I.e Raptors before Kawhi, Bucks first couple times around)The @memgrizz are about to do something special. I hate it for you bandwagon fans in Memphis that don’t support your local team. You’re going to miss out big time.

In my latest for @SBD, I took a look at both teams and their play as of late, as well as provide my prediction and best bet for the game: https://t.co/nDD0LHIcbD@memgrizz Memphis 10 streak@memgrizz Yeah I'm feeling blue but not what you think, I'm feeling Beale street Blues! 💙💙💙@JarronJackson4 @IiconicKaze @FuriousStilez @YahooSports @memgrizz Yeah this…@ProphNYK @memgrizz Errbody know who 12 is. In Memphis. Mane.@FuriousStilez @YahooSports @memgrizz Uh… what? More to life? He’s literally a professional basketball player this is life. The kid is wearing the opposing teams jersey. Lol he doesn’t owe him anything. Plus the kid is probably getting a jersey so relax.@_MitchellAllen_ @ElvisFreshley88 @jeb_hart @stephenasmith @PAKA_FLOCKA @memgrizz @JaMorant Playoff ball is just too different and the rotations shorten down so coaching plays a bigger role. The experience of 7 game series and how to win them is the only thing i think they are missing THIS YEAR.@memgrizz Me after betting on Memphis vs Dallas mavs https://t.co/LjfGElALAq@memgrizz i’m doing online school, so please guess my mood@JordanPerk96 @memgrizz whats funny is you follow our grizz twitter account but non of us follow your golden state twitter account. lmao

Love her knowledge and perspective on the NBA and especially the @memgrizz@TheWood901 @memgrizz @GrizzOnBally 10 in a row is the record for a single season. Grizzlies had previously had an 11-game streak that went from end of one season into start of next season.@statmuse @memgrizz @GrizzliesPR @jarenjacksonjr @DBane0625 They've been really impressive this year

Should note the Jazz were right there until Gobert went down with health and safety, Jazz haven't won a game without him and got blown out by 30 against the pistons without Gobert

Gobert is the definition of an MVP@memgrizz Feeling good, Feeling, great.  How are  you?@memgrizz Good
