#arbitrage #bettingtwitter #bettingpicks #sportsbets #freepicks #freemoney #mlb1/2 Can the Wizards just shock us again and win today and improve to 7-3. I need a positive game from a Washington team because the WFT has reverted back to its old ways. The Washington Capitals are banged up and lose. The Wizards are the only legit team right now.@anonymous_fatty @nytimes I’m not a fan. I make my money understanding profit and loss statements, not knowing all there is to know about a jock!

He played for the Chicago Bulls and the Washington Wizards. DID HE WIN A CHAMPIONSHIP WITH THE WIZARDS?🥴🥲@christi58057269 @anthonydavisinc @nbacommish17 Washington Wizards 6-3 right now without Russell Westbrook, while Lakers just watched Westbrook stink up the joint against the Portland Trailblazers. 😑😑😑 Horrible trade, Washington laughing at us. https://t.co/bozaIx6hexMilwaukee Bucks vs Washington Wizards 11/7/2021 Picks Predictions Previews
