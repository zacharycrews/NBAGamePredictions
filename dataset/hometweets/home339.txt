I'm feeling good about tonight.
Curry going off for 30 and Warriors will win by double digits, breaking the Suns win streak.
Dubs came off a b2b to lose to Bucks after 24 wins, Suns off a b2b...Cavs pounded the Heat in 1991 by 68 pts.
Pacers pwnd the Blazers in 1988 by 65 pts.
Mavs pwnd the Hornets this year by 68 pts in the preseason!
Now this? I must be looking into a high school game score.
I'll bet one day the Golden State Warriors will attempt anything like this. https://t.co/g2Hd9wgd5Y@MikeESPNSA I expect @spurs to beat @warriors . @Suns might be🤫

@Garydwayne https://t.co/5FRu2ELewIAfter watching the best @suns game ever a couple days ago against @warriors, and seeing OKC lose by 73, I’m super thankful for what we have. Let’s extend the streak to 18! https://t.co/iTvEvlMC9V@tnshholy @MasterytTix @warriors @Oracle Shit was corny@tnshholy @MasterytTix @warriors @Oracle No nigga📺 Juan Toscano-Anderson workout/3s after Golden State Warriors practice, day before Phoenix Suns

https://t.co/9GrcBmIc3Zone of my biggest dreams is to watch stephen curry play in real life @warriors @StephenCurry30@warriors @Oracle Last game don't count+still winning the finals@ll0ydd0bler @cooliworldpeace @NBAonTNT @warriors @Suns The nets (and Durant), would counter…”yes but we can sign kd even without a s@t but because of y’all cap y’all can only sign Deangelo with this deal, so include something else in it”… the warriors the basicallly debated their way into sending the least value pick@antonin_org No SGA or Josh Giddey. That OKC squad out there would be a G-League team's G-League team lol

Still better than the 2000-01 Golden State Warriors tho@ll0ydd0bler @cooliworldpeace @NBAonTNT @warriors @Suns For basically a useless draft pick? U absolutely right, bet the nets and kd would’ve taken a lottery pick if we chose to give it… it’s credit to tbw management that they tried to reduce that extra price we had to include to almost nothing@ll0ydd0bler @cooliworldpeace @NBAonTNT @warriors @Suns Bruh😂… he was involved in a transaction that helped the warriors… he didn’t “give” the warriors anything, nor did he try to make the trade lean in our favor, it just happened to work out as such@jacob_seliga @warriors Bro you didn’t even read the caption 🤣 Warriors forever my guy@DemiseGE @cooliworldpeace @NBAonTNT @warriors @Suns and kd didn’t ‘give’ anything.  he got too.  but he didn’t have to.  that’s the point@DemiseGE @cooliworldpeace @NBAonTNT @warriors @Suns for basically a useless draft pick.  sure.@cooliworldpeace @ll0ydd0bler @NBAonTNT @warriors @Suns Y’all childish acting like kd tried to “give” warriors shit when it was another man’s decision(Deangelo) to choose to agree to come to gsw just as much as it was Durant’s to go to the nets, kd ain’t decide shit except give the nets leverage to ask for a bit more@cooliworldpeace @ll0ydd0bler @NBAonTNT @warriors @Suns It was the same as any other transaction in the nba, two teams tryna form a deal that benifits each of them the fuckjn most… kd didnt try to give the warriors fuckjn nothin… warriors wanted to make the most of it and so did the nets@SInow @okcthunder @memgrizz WHHHHAAATTT?! Even the Golden State Warriors couldn't get a point differential THAT large! 😯Scouting the Suns for the Warriors so they beat them tomorrow @warriors https://t.co/meji3SjLLt@cooliworldpeace @ll0ydd0bler @NBAonTNT @warriors @Suns Only diff was the gsw simply COULDN’T  sign russel without the s&amp;t while in the net’s case they COULD sign kd straight up, although with a bit worse cap outcome and less salary… that is why kd and the nets wanted something else in itI wish I could watch @warriors games in a movie theater.Aside from "Western Conference Player of the Month material," how else would you describe @StephenCurry30's superb play in October and November? #NBA75 

🎥 @warriors https://t.co/9ze29SXrY8@warriors Isn’t that 4 months?@cooliworldpeace @ll0ydd0bler @NBAonTNT @warriors @Suns Came from the source u just provided. Yes gsw tried to have a straight up sign and trade🤦‍♂️ who the f wouldn’t… y’all need to quit acting like only kd was a free agent, Deangelo was the exact same… nets convinced kd to sign, and warriors had to convince russel https://t.co/ox04gaRZIE@warriors @Oracle #StephGonnaSteph Steph gonna Steph We love you @StephenCurry30@warriors @StephenCurry30 Third😂@warriors @Oracle Would love to see Jordan Poole play an all round player and play his game, cuz he has game. And knows how to play with Steph Dray and Wiggins@ayruuus The Warriors are the only other team in the league that I follow so I would love that trade. I want to see sabonis as one of the greatest of all time and Golden State could do that for him@NBAPR @warriors @BrooklynNets @StephenCurry30 @KDTrey5 Lebron and giannis betterLooks like the @Suns will win its 18th straight. Can’t wait for the clash against the @warriors tomorrow. Must see TV! #NBA75@gswph @warriors @Oracle Yes they will 💪@warriors @Oracle Joordan Poole and Stephen Curry tommorrow will make a legacy!! That's it🥺#Best of the day on https://t.co/MqmlMsmdvk
