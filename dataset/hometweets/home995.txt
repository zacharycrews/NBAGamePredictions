But they have been good players anyway. That was already written.@LeeenaBellle87 A set stolen from the Brad Stevens Boston Celtics playbook3 seed is on the table handle business @celtics@BobbySolez Boston Celtics and my old man is a Mavericks fan@nyknicks &amp; @Lakers both have 28 wins

😂😂😂😂😂 https://t.co/aWKIS4wS7X@2_M_I_C_H_A_E_L @celtics @NBA By far Lol 😆 The current NBA is easier than ever. No defense, 3 second zone and no hand check allowed. Everyone who is talented today gets more than 30 points in a game. 🤦🏻‍♂️@olliebrown_13 @NBA @celtics @jaytatum0 And what’s that even mean ? He’s only getting that many points cuz he’s on the Celtics ? That any star can do that ? Or he can’t score like that on other teams ? 🤡.
