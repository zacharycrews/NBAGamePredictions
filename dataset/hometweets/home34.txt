Can u call Steve Nash in the office &amp; ask him.

How the 🤬do u not play Bruce Brown?

At all.

Vs the @Bucks, commentator said, @SteveNash wants to see how the other bench players play.

If true, what kind of YMCA coaching is that?

@BruceBrown11 @SteveNash@BrooklynNets Lakers betterStill trying to figure it out.
But headed in the right direction.

8 winners will be selected randomly on Sunday https://t.co/gkflrALGzz@Red_Roscoe If Kimmich was some random on Twitter, he'd be copping abuse. But most randoms don't have a Covid-based charity. Yes, it deals with the "poverty of COVID", but vaccines are a key way out of the economic misery of COVID. @FCBayernEN may need to go the way of @BrooklynNets soon.@Ballislife @BrooklynNets If bro ain’t get injured that year he could’ve been an MVP candidateIn addition, the 76ers will host the Nets again on Thursday March 10th, 2022. Prior to that matchup in Philly, these teams will meet again on Thursday December 16th in Brooklyn.Last night, the Philadelphia 76ers suffered a heartbreaking home loss to the Brooklyn Nets. PHI led throughout the whole game until BKN came back. To those that experienced it, I feel your pain right now, but there's nothing we can do to go back and change it.@JetLinter @BrooklynNets @JHarden13 Nah he’s a great go to off the benchLaMarcus Aldridge Delivers Down Stretch as Brooklyn Nets Beat Philadelphia 76ers @BrooklynNets https://t.co/uVWfHpvioy@ModeSatoshi @kejr_ @BrooklynNets @Patty_Mills Please don’t compare Patty Mills to Ben Simmons who refused to represent Australia at the Olympics@BrooklynNets @aldridge_12 Still a punk for claiming heart issues after Drummond owned him last year litterally the next day retired " do to heart complications.
