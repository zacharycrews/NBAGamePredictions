My point is that the players are starting to give some grief about the criticism they are getting which is much less than other marketsThe Utah Jazz are currently the 1st seed in the Northwest division, and the 4th seed in Western conference with a record of 41 wins and 25 losses

Vaccination card?@DennisHobb @utahjazz The reason they lose big leads is that Donovan Mitchell keeps on flexing on every time he scores and he forgets to get back on defense, that is how egoistic and selfish this player is.

With five games in seven days, two back-to-backs, and four different cities, the @utahjazz finally put an end to this difficult stretch when they host the @SacramentoKings on Saturday night
#TakeNote | #NBA75@jazzmomm Live In Virginia and was born in Utah and I follow every team I can from Utah which is Real Salt Lake and the Utah Jazz also the Wizards are garbage so there's that. Been a Jazz fan since the Gordon Hayward 7 game series against the clippers in 2016.@WorldWideWob @MUSSemeritus We all know that the Utah Jazz with Stockton and Malone is the right answer…Born #OTD in 1957 Rickey Williams, Bishop Timon graduate, member of the 1982-83 Utah Jazz. https://t.co/Guz6v7sIQz@RogacionJose @utahjazz But I agree, the Jazz keep throwing up threes whether they are hitting them or not. And attempts to drive fail because their spacing is bad. They get lazy and sloppy when they have a big lead and can’t get into any flow.Today's NBA Consensus (So Far):

Chicago Bulls 76%
Denver Nuggets 69%
Miami Heat 67%
Utah Jazz 63%
San Antonio Spurs 60%
Portland Trail Blazers 58%
Milwaukee Bucks 53%@RogacionJose @utahjazz Gobert only has a good outcome if he is in position to dunk the ball. He has no ability to move with the ball and usually turns it over. Unless it can be delivered in dunk position I would be hesitant to give him the ball also.Our first @NBA game. 

@utahjazz vs. @spurs 

Got to hear the Admiral David Robinson give an encouraging word to believers afterwards. 

Coach Popovich takes 1st place in most wins as a coach in NBA History.

We instead die by the 3. Literally go cold and die. LolGregg Popovich stands alone. Tonight the Spurs head coach surpassed Don Nelson to become the NBA’s All-Time winningest coach. Win #1336 vs the Utah Jazz, 104-102. Congratulations 🏀 @spurs #greggpopovich @KPIXtv @cbslocal https://t.co/iSvueIUF4u@utahjazz @spurs You did not just post this@ryankpeterson @utahjazz how much time you got left? 😂@utahjazz I don't think the team can win the series against the Mavs or the Nuggets in the first round@kristennikole22 I made a $1000 bet with my friend in 2008 that if the @utahjazz win a championship by the time I’m 50, I win. If they don’t I’m out a grand.

This team was supposed to help me collect. It’s getting scary@JamesWClawson @THE_TERMIN80R @utahjazz And those same Bucks are 16-7 against the West this year.@utahjazz what are you going to do different to stop the Jazz losing games where they are ahead and that they should win?@utahjazz @spurs Glad we were the ones to give it to him.  Wouldn’t want another team taking that L for himCongratulations, Coach Pop 🖤 

A historic night and 1,336 wins.

#TakeNote | @spurs https://t.co/f3LFE6WeuZ@Tee_kayee Thabo wasn’t good for the locker room at all. He hated Utah. Jazz opted for Mudiay over Neto based off of talent instead of this and it was an awful decision@WIGUY8 @JamesWClawson @utahjazz For real lol, the west is just top heavy. East is stacked.Cupcake @utahjazz give Pop a record. The chemistry on this team is long gone.@JamesWClawson @THE_TERMIN80R @utahjazz The East is arguably better and deeper than the West for the first time in a long time.@utahjazz Congratulating the other team for winning is something that has become historic for the Jazz!@utahjazz Jerry Sloan better@spurs And to do it against the @utahjazz the team Pop modeled the Spurs after. Quite fitting. Congrats Pop!The Utah Jazz will always be Pop’s bitch. Congrats Coach !.@utahjazz are 80% through the season with a record of (41-25)

Final score 104-102. 💯😎@RichJMarsh @utahjazz They made changes but they didn’t improve their team. We’ve known for years now that:
1. Their backcourt is too short 
2. They need a better more athletic wing defender than Royce. 
They drafted Doka and Butler and have traded away assets. Those 2 issues haven’t been addressed.@utahjazz Donovan must be the least clutch "star" in this league. I knew this team was going nowhere when they replaced Rubio with an exact replica who gets paid 4 times more.

#TakeNoteJazz get up big then start to coast and now it’s a tight game when it shouldn’t be.  Rinse repeat @utahjazz  #TakeNoteI'm convinced the @utahjazz have never watched film of themselves or maybe they'd realize how many times they have Gobert open and don't feed him. #secondroundexit@utahjazz @JordanClarksons Then, he goes back to the bench when they needed buckets. And now they are losing to spurs.@utahjazz @rudygobert27 Tell everyone to stop chucking up dumb threes and give it to Gobert where he has a mismatch. 3 shots for him is embarrassingSan Antonio Spurs vs Utah Jazz was on AT&amp;T Sportsnet Rocky Mountain. With commentary from Craig Bolerjack. Co-commentator is Thurl Bailey.  For more details see https://t.co/usWR2aUKWy #SanAntonioSpurs #UtahJazz #ATTSportsnetRockyMountain@utahjazz @rudygobert27 Come on Snyder! Why is House in there and not Clarkson?! Should of challenged that 3 foul call too! Come on! Do better....!@AinsleyInc My husband thought we were going to the Oilers game and I told him no, that was crazy. And then we watched at home as the NBA cancelled the Utah Jazz game because Gobert tested positive. If the NBA cancelled the game, I knew the world would take this seriously.*when the spidey senses are tingling* 🕷

#TakeNote https://t.co/3Nk5TOw5O1For all the talk, ad nauseum, about defense the @utahjazz sure as shit can’t play a lick of it….Boy are the Utah Jazz some fraudsNever underestimate the @utahjazz ability to craft a fourth quarter collapse. 🙄@TopSportsMind @utahjazz Damn how much money you lose. Called basketball.When I’m in a blow a major lead challenge and my opponent is the Utah JazzTHERE IS NO WAY UNDER THE SUN FOR THE SPURS TO SCRE 34 PONTS INT NHE 2ND AND 3rd QUARTERS COMBINED AND THEN DO IT IN THE 4th! THAT IS THE DEFINTION OF REFEREE RIGING! @utahjazz@utahjazz @rudygobert27 The W?now you see it,

#TakeNote https://t.co/5w2FzfyTEvThe @utahjazz and @spurs combine to score just 29 points in the third quarter and the Jazz take a 10 point lead into the final period. 

First team to find some offense probably wins this one.

https://t.co/cg3PmjvxeC@seagullsquirrel @spidadmitchell @utahjazz @SoleSavy I went from. 9.5 to a 10 and I think they’re just fine.11-4 close to the quarter for the professional basketball players who reside in Utah.

Jazz are 38-7 when they lead after 36 minutes.@BleedBlueJeremy @spidadmitchell @utahjazz @SoleSavy @jchizzy21 Yessir. I went a half size up tho. Definitely the best model out of all the DONs.RUDY

I would like to see a little more sun to remove the highlighter feel from the mountains.#utahjazz #takenote this is the worst third-quarter I have ever seen the Jazz play and Conley is horrifically bad. I can’t believe the boys @1280thezone talked me into believing in Mike Conley.  he’s a big poser. He’s old unfocused and possibly injured. #JustSayinI really miss Bojan rn #utahjazz #TakeNoteI’m really struggling to cope with the fact of the Utah Jazz of only scored two points in the third quarter so far…The @utahjazz defense has only allowed 8 points to the @spurs in the first 7:31 of the second half. 

But the offense has scored just 2 points. 

It's been ugly.

https://t.co/FMGXPfIj7u https://t.co/PSIRMv2RXFSo far a pretty entertaining game to watch. Wish there were less turnovers and actual play calls but just looking forward to the finish line as the Jazz lead 59-50 going into the half
#TakeNote #UtahJazz #NBA75this one’s heavy on the sauce 🕷

#TakeNote https://t.co/5mAhGQGjNvBrilliant first half from Donovan MItchell who has 18 first half points. 

The @utahjazz lead the @spurs 59-50 at the break.

No prob.

#TakeNote | @spidadmitchell https://t.co/LicpY8wkcBThe first half closes with @utahjazz ahead 59-50 over @spurs.
Donovan Mitchell is up to 18 points so far.

How narrow are they?With 6:50 left in the first half the @utahjazz lead the @spurs 42-41. 

The Jazz offense is clearly missing Bojan Bogdanovic's scoring and floor spacing.

#utahjazz https://t.co/4gb810iwHhMike Conley hits 3 of 3 free throws to end the first quarter. @utahjazz leads over @spurs 33-30.
Donovan Mitchell leads the Jazz with 8 points.After one the @utahjazz lead the @spurs 33-30. 

An early six points from Mike Conley is a good sign for the Jazz.
