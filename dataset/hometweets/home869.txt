#FearTheDeer #OnWisconsinGiannis Antetokounmpo scored a season-high 50 points, two off his career best, and pulled down 14 rebounds to lead the Milwaukee Bucks past the skidding Indiana Pacers 128-119 on Tuesday night. https://t.co/iS80POuHDIPhiladelphia 76ers 87 (Joel Embiid 19 pts) Boston Celtics 135 (Jayson Tatum 28 pts, 12 rebs), Milwaukee Bucks 128 (Giannis Antetokounmpo 50 pts, 14 rebs) Indiana Pacers 119 (Buddy Hield 36 pts)@usatf @Pacers @justingatlin Why of all teams, the Indiana Pacers doing this? Gatlin from NY, went to U of TN. Is Indiana a main hub for distributing  amphetamines &amp; testosterone?"It was great to have him back."
