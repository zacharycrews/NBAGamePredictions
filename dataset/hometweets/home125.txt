#GrindCity did I do that?
#NBA #sportspicks #machinelearning #finance#Grizz are currently a 1pt favorite at Washington tonight. Wizards have played well early but dropped their last two. This is a game where they‚Äôll definitely miss Dillon Brooks. Guarding Dinwiddie/Beal/KCP won‚Äôt be an easy task. I think they‚Äôll need a big Ja game to secure a W. https://t.co/5zDJn11OhaNot a match.

PJ WashingtonTbh Middleton having COVID worries me for this Wizards game.  For whatever reason, Bradley Beal always seems to go off against the Bucks.  It's mitigated by the fact that Middleton always puts up a 50 piece (or close to it) against Washington.  Gonna be a interesting game.
