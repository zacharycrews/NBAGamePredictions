Randle shouldn't be the primary ball handler but he is for this team. So until we can get a guard that can facilitate, we'll continue to see our offense be as stagnant as it is when Randle has the ball.@nyknicks SHAGGAG W’S AS E  I D IF HZZ A HZZ A D V@nyknicks The court looks fire!

We couldn't keep a lead going into the 3rd. 

Distributing the minutes to the youth should eliminate the fatigue on our starters going into the 4th. 

That's step 1.@nyknicks New team as well?@nyknicks I have two tickets available for tomorrows games  best offer gets them.. low ball prices will be ignored https://t.co/1SMdMASktN@nyknicks Omg this is it@nyknicks How y'all lose to the Wizards without Beal yesterday?

With that said, when we're at full strength, I wanna see deeper rotations. 

Enough with the 9 man rotation. We're gassed coming out of the half because we're not utilizing our depth.Atlanta Hawks star Trae Young (H&amp;S protocols) is not expected to be cleared in time for the Christmas Day game against the New York Knicks, league sources tell @YahooSports.There was a @KembaWalker sighting in MSG last night!!! Side note @nyknicks lost #kembawalker #knicks https://t.co/qcPzuyxmJ7@nyknicks Finally!!@nyknicks Hopefully some new players. Randle and Fournier gone please@nyknicks is that 1 group lebron is speaking about https://t.co/7gGYTHXBoG@nyknicks The benching worked. Now its time for Julius and Evan to sit for 10 games.It’s looking like the major problem with the @nyknicks is Thibbs. His inability to hold players accountable and use proper rotations has cost the knicks so many games this season. Benching Kemba is the icing on a pretty awful season for him as a coach.@nyknicks Kemba just needed a load management break and now he’s cured. Lfg 😤😤😤@samaguilar08 @nyknicks @KembaWalker Section 220 Row 2@nyknicks Knicks are cursed until the regular court is painted orange in the key.  The blue just doesn’t do it@dberk1 @nyknicks I’m actually very in on this@nyknicks @JackMulq thoughts?Not a @nyknicks fan, but I’m really digging this new orange and black vibe they’re taking on!! 🟠⚫️ https://t.co/2F8xUEwbfn@dan_ny_b @KITH @nyknicks nice.. now play like you are the dam HOME TEAM!@samaguilar08 @nyknicks @KembaWalker 227 each, dm and I’ll show you the section they’re nice seatsCP from KFTV said it best. Randle is feeling the pressure of New York. You could tell he’s in his own head not even bringing back the braids. 

Y’all think I’m joking when I say the air is different putting on that Knicks jersey. It’ll have guys looking like they have asthma.Last night, Kemba Walker became the 17th player to ever record 40 or more points and 8 or more assists in a New York Knicks uniform. 

He is the only one to do so without committing a turnover, which the league started tracking in 1967. https://t.co/yzBPpVIjuf@nyknicks Please win on that court@nyknicks can we get some wins on this court please@nyknicks @DvoKyle14 👀 ohhh ok@NBATV @nyknicks @KembaWalker Is that what washed up looks like?@nyknicks A that Black paint is tough as hell, permanent?@dan_ny_b @KITH @nyknicks Absolutely fire can’t wait for tmr to see it@nyknicks don’t let Evan Fournier and Julius Randle ruin this court by playing basketball on it plsTomorrow, the Christmas Day local sports programming (as presently scheduled) will include -
