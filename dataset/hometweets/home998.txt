After we squeezed out a win in IND we are in Miami tonight. MIA is coming off of a 21 point loss to the Suns on Wednesday. Butler and Martin are questionable for the Heat, we are without Caris and JA. Looking forward to new addition Moses Browns debut!

Miami Heat v Milwaukee Bucks- A proper scrap fest this one. Heat will want to prove that their 2020 finals appearance was no fluke and Milwaukee wants to defend their title. Despite the Heat having home court advantage, I think Giannis will put in an-2nd Round:

Miami Heat v Chicago Bulls- Ah as much as I want to say the Bulls will dig deep and pull through, the Heat have amazing defense and depth. My brain says Heat in 6 but provided the Bulls sort their injuries out, an upset isn't far away. Hopefully I'll see Bulls in 7🤷🏽‍♂️First round: 
1st seed v 8th seed- Miami Heat vs Toranto Raptors. See the Heat winning this without much fuss in 5 games

Beating the 76ers, Brooklyn is now two games back from Toronto for the 7-seed and Philadelphia is now 3 games behind the 1-seeded Miami Heat.@BryanTeixeira00 Miami Heat vs Dallas Mavericks finals Game 4@ale1coq @valerielouredaa @FTXArena @MiamiHEAT This isn’t direct message broI forgot about the Miami Heat wowI thought only Miami Heat fans do this 🥴 https://t.co/7LRxb8HZVYLet’s see if @espn talks as much shit about the 76ers, as they did about the @MiamiHEAT last night. We just lost to the #1 team in the East, winning 13 of 15…but the Heat is done right ESPN? Fraud-ass network. We also recently beat both these teams. #weruntheeast #heathateWas making a sandwich and started having dark thoughts. So I started a podcast, #HEATCULTURA on Spotify. 30m. Thanks for listening. https://t.co/avrVt2bQpu
@MichaelRyanRuiz @HeatvsHaters #HEATCulture @billygil @LeBatardShow @EthanJSkolnick @5ReasonsSports #HEATNation #MiamiHeat@dfreeze4 @valerielouredaa @FTXArena @MiamiHEAT Wrong. Have some nuts. https://t.co/gJwlILb4TMThank you Brooklyn Nets, for humbling tf out of Sixers fans tonight. No excuses for Philly, you had the next “Kobe and Shaq” playing tonight. Your Free Throw boys couldn’t do anything other than get to the line. Heat in 7, btw. #miamiheat #HEATCulture #chipsznThe Nets and 76ers iso ball doesn’t work against a complete team … @MiamiHEAT beats both teamsIf I’m the Miami heat I’ll start losing on purpose I would not wanna play the nets in the 1st round@BradyHawk305 That’s a Miami Heat move for sure@DayoNYC @Anthony_Chiang @MiamiHEAT Lmao bam adebayo averaging 40 ppg in a playoff series vs brooklyn@_PabloHeatin5 @biscaynemayne Miami heat could beat the Nets, be it in the 1st or 2nd round@_PabloHeatin5 @BradyHawk305 That’s what you think, but it will be the other way around, as miami heat could beat the Nets be it in the 1st or 2nd roundBut that Miami Heat tho 😮‍💨🔥MIAMI HEAT OU 76ERS VAI PEGAR ESSE NETS NO 1° ROUND KKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKK@DayoNYC @Anthony_Chiang @MiamiHEAT They’ll be the 7 seed assuming they win play in games👍🏽The Miami Heat should trade Jayson Tatum for Kevin Love #HEATCulture https://t.co/rPeM6qLFqlI just want to be a financial analyst for Miami HEAT and live next to CNCO already. I don’t want to school anymore.Nets Can’t Ever Do This To The Miami Heat@Anthony_Chiang Yes they are, and let's no bullshit ourselves, @MiamiHEAT don't want this for 7 games. Nope🤦🏾‍♂️The Miami Heat is in perfect position as a one-seed. They should not let that opportunity get away. Being a 2nd or 3rd seed in the playoffs will be the bracket of death.Only team the Nets should be worried about if they’re healthy are the Miami heat. They have the toughest and deepest group of players in the league. Sixers won’t be a problem unfortunately due to Harden being a choker and the bucks aren’t the same defensively.Me and my ex have to drink this next time we get together and go to a Miami Heat Game together too https://t.co/ULb3RzuUbeIf im the Miami Heat, im getting out that 1st spot@Anthony_Chiang @MiamiHEAT in 5 

ALL DAMN DAY !!!!If a No. 1 #MiamiHeat face a No. 8 Brooklyn Nets in the first round of the playoffs, national commentators will predict which team to win the series?

(#NBATwitter; #NBA)Then have to go through the @Giannis_An34 @chicagobulls @MiamiHEAT just to name a few. “I love sports” fan just saying.

It’s time to boycott Florida!Man I don’t want my Miami Heat to have to see Brooklyn on the first round with a determined KD and untucked/unvaxxed Kyrie 🤣@NBA2K_MyTEAM Finally getting a Miami Heat Lebron that is great before May 🤣This ain’t nowhere near the hate Bron got when he went back to Cleveland with the Miami Heat lol@Anthony_Chiang That’s all fine with Miami.. even when atop of the East, Heat’s mindset are like underdogs.. they are all about competition.. bring them on.. whoever they may be…if the sixers play for my bday (june11) let’s go to a game against the heat in philly or miami https://t.co/vwod6tB138@NBA2K_MyTEAM I was watching a Miami heat lebum tiktok when this got tweeted@honestGSWfan The Miami heat@MiamiHEAT @me_kimba We’ll get ‘em Friday night. Heat vs. Cavaliers, 8:00pm, Eastern 🏀Since Feb. 15, the Sixers have had their asses handed to them by the Boston Celtics, the Miami Heat and for the first 24 minutes… the Brooklyn Nets #SixersVsNets@nathanmarzion It's not like his earning those fouls like giannis, is equivalent to miami heat lebron flopping.@Anthony_Chiang @sixers yu hear that. I know he wasn’t talking about @MiamiHEATGoran still doing @MiamiHEAT shit I see 💯🔥@Goran_Dragic taking a charge against the 76ers like he was back on the @MiamiHEAT  😭 #HeatCulture@eric_nehm Miami heat level of crazy when they play the bucks@Ulloque_ 😂😂😂😂 for me, it’s tweets about the Miami Heat and *NsyncThat's Miami Heat basketball from GoranMiami heat legend groan Dragic for 3!@PlayStreaks That was the Miami Heat@MiamiHEAT Don’t forget about Strus@alltheanswaz @BleacherReport Being a leader isn’t being clutch. Ray Allen was clutch but he didn’t lead miami heatI’m jacking the nets can if they get healthy. RT @Jones4You: Neither of these teams can beat the @MiamiHEAT in 7….. but the Nets look goodReggie Miller got me cussing at my TV🤬 Kyrie hit a 3 and starts with nobody should want Brooklyn in the 1st round
.....please it's like overreacting is what everybody does now...Heat in 5! #miamiheat@WardellPlsWin The dude who got me to watch basketball him and the Miami Heat. Hope he gets better and playsABSOLUTELY EVERYBODY: NOBODY WANTS TO SEE NETS IN THE FIRST ROUND

REGGIE MILLER: IF YOUR MIAMI, BUCKS,HEAT I DON’T WANT TO SEE BROOKLYN IN A FIRST ROUD MATCHUP AT ALL, I’M SORRY! https://t.co/eIdLivZFGN@BleacherReport No @MiamiHEAT  ? Why the constant disrespect 🤷🏽‍♂️Reggie Miller talkin bout “if you’re Miami Milwaukee or Philly, you don’t want to see the nets in the first round.” 

WE WANT THAT SMOKE!! @MiamiHEAT  🔥😤🔥😤🔥😤🔥🔥😤If Season ended today and Brooklyn advance in play in, they'd be playing Miami Heat in first round @Djbienaime 👀👀The Miami heat will kill th 76ers reggie right like I said they sent Seth away and that was most their shooting.Devin Booker's return fuels Phoenix Suns past Miami Heat in matchup of conference leaders
https://t.co/6JY8oLBo5B
https://t.co/6JY8oLBo5B@HeatvsHaters They still can’t believe how good miami heat are, the failure to mention Bam, Herro and Spo is intentional, but Go Go Go Miami Heat, I’m praying for you@Major_Passons Exactly &amp; no other team guards him better than your Miami Heat 🔥🔥🔥Neither of these teams can beat the @MiamiHEAT in 7….. but the Nets look good@sweethartsami Sami sweetie it’s not our fault you’re like 5’9 damn girl get off Twitter and go help out your Miami heat smhI’m supposed to think the Miami Heat are going to beat this team in the 1st round?

Ben Simmons be damned, if I get Kyrie for every game? Brooklyn in 6@LacroixButler @ramreport4u I may be a closet Miami Heat fan.  I goto one game in Miami and they keep sending me season ticket and playoff ticket info…lol.@TMathSports The Heat have been awesome, but realistically the winner will come from the east. Milwaukee, Miami, Philly, even The Nets 😵‍💫Miami Heat fans talking about Embiid       foul baiting as if ‘Jimmy Buckets’ don’t do the same thing is hilarious@BatdadUT @SInow @MiamiHEAT @JimmyButler One year agoMiami heat legend Goran Dragic with the assistMiami Heat gone be sick playing an eighth seed Brooklyn Nets team in the first round. HATE TO SEE ITBam and Jimmy, get out of here @BleacherReport.

Heat taking the finals @MiamiHEAT https://t.co/2PutnI0kSgIf ANYONE thinks that if the Nets have Kyrie , KD , &amp; Simmons for the entire playoffs, that they won’t run through everyone, you ain’t watching basketball lol.

&amp; I love the Miami Heat! But them 2 in Brooklyn really does this. They really put points up….@CuffsTheLegend When you went to Heat games they had Prime LeBron James and they were always winning plus it’s MiamiAnyone in NYC have a private jet they want to fly me to Miami on to see Cavs Heat tomorrow?😭🤣@Don1Lucie @ItsMaDash @LevitatingWolf MJ doesn’t fulfill enough roles on the basketball court like Lebron did for Miami. 

If MJ played on that heat team they only win 2. They beat the mavs and OKC. They would’ve lost both to the Spurs.never seen Miami Heat fans walk into the arena MAD at the WORLD 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣@NBA2K_MyTEAM We need Miami Heat lebron James https://t.co/1xNYexlJmxwhen i went to Miami Heat games in Miami their fans were always happy and vibrant as hell 🔥🔥🔥@ChefTrillie_ They still can’t believe how good miami heat are#MIAvsCLE
