TS: Heizz@PMarshall16 @itzmeatt Bro the suns just gave up 124 to@the kings last week and have been in dog fights with mediocre teams. That’s not saying they get they Ws but Boston, Milwaukee, Phoenix. They don’t do it all the time but let’s not act like everyone is held under 100 pts.@poppalu19 @Suns The gorilla one is 🔥@JesseGojkovich @KendrickPerkins @Suns SMH….   I understand what you’re saying.: however… the difference is… it’s was expected for you all to be where you all are…:  it wasn’t for us.. so it’s just an acknowledgment on how far we’ve come. Not shade on the Suns.(6/6) DESTINY.

Like the legendary Phoenix, rising from the ashes, so again do our collective hopes for this franchise.

What is it about this 2021-22 Suns team that gives you hope the drought is about to end?

Their .780 away winning percentage finishes better than every other team's HOME winning percentage.

Phoenix is the second team in NBA history to achieve this feat, along with the Knicks in 1969-70, who went on to win the championship. https://t.co/ohQzrlDLDi@MysticMind17 @kmac @dwallacewells Here in Phoenix we have extremely reliable sun, and with a concept known as distributed energy resources, energy can be transported to places with unreliable sun.

Bc even if this current warriors team plays the Suns, they have no chance.If the Suns win this year, Phoenix is gone be lit asf.The Korean  Zombie’s  strategy is similar very similar to the 7 seconds or less Phoenix Suns’ strategy. This is both a complement and a knock. #UFC273@Comineyha11 @Money23Green @CJC9BOSS @warriors @Suns Big 3 isn’t old yet. A HUGE difference between your early and late 30’s and they’re going to be buoyed in the near future by the development of the youngsters.@DogSurfRoadshow @Money23Green @CJC9BOSS @warriors @Suns 5 years ago, I believe you but the warriors are in the past and that's ok.

Put the cuffs on Mitchell. Yet another superstar with a rough night. The era of the three ball and the @Suns  #1 in defending the 3. Thanks to the hopefully DPOY @mikal_bridges https://t.co/o53feBtUdQ@AJRazim @HamptonMuhammad @LegionHoops @JakeLFischer @Suns because HIS team didn't win... folks still salty about the bubble lmao@picjerphoto @TheTradeShow33 @HustlinShowroom @TheJurassicPack @Suns @TheArchiveClub Thank youPowell returns, Clippers beat Suns for 3rd straight win https://t.co/igUfQTqyS2 ## Would want Clippers to meet and beat Phoenix on the first round of the Play-offs.  And the Timberwolves beating the Grizzlies.The Phoenix Suns' 2022 playoff path is starting to become clearer, as the Western Conference play-in tournament is set.

Yet people out here talking about the lakers nets and grizzlies all damn year. Irony….@PorkFriedWife @Suns You are deserving… don’t ever forget that 🤩@picjerphoto @TheTradeShow33 @HustlinShowroom @TheJurassicPack @TheArchiveClub Long forward to a long playoff run by the Phoenix @Suns!I asked my friends who will win the NBA Championship.
1. Milwaukee Bucks (15.3%)
2. Philadelphia 76ers(10.6%)
3. Phoenix Suns(9.7%)
4. Utah Jazz(8.6%)
5. Brooklyn Nets(8.1%)
6. Memphis Grizzlies (7.3%)
7. Miami Heat(6.9%)
8. Golden State Warriors(5.4%)
9. Boston Celtics(4.1%) https://t.co/w3iJlNZI6V@__theaquacave @Suns Bookmarks are getting full@adam7ii_ @DogSurfRoadshow @Money23Green @CJC9BOSS @warriors @Suns You tell me🤷🏻‍♂️. Made a few crucial mental errors at the end of that game lol@__Fresha @AllAzSports1 @Suns Hatin when you don't have to is herb mentality@Suns That… that one wasn’t all the way.. flat@lone_N_little @TheUncleGhandi @Copia2328 @Mavs_FFL The Mavericks will need six or seven games to beat the Jazz and if they make it to the second round, they will get killed by Phoenix. The Suns deeper and more talented than the Mavericks, that’s a fact not my opinion.@Suns Put them online! #please@Suns Javale McGeeeeeeee@Kenneth63372372 @Suns Mine came too! 💜🧡@Suns Where’s the @FSKPart3  jerseys?@christycruz @Suns @DevinBook Thank you! I don’t know if I want to paint it haha I love how it looks just like this!From a Phoenix Suns perspective, I would love to see this playoff picture by the end of the season and play-in tournament.

Suns 1st vs Spurs 8th
Memphis 2nd vs Clippers 7th
Warriors 3rd vs Utah 6th

Hope you got to share it with someone special. #azwx https://t.co/OQvRfkYsJR@valleymetro @Suns @FootprintCNTR it's a shame public transportation in Phoenix doesn't matter if they pass or don't pass one leaves work and wants to get home and for that one pays transportation 4 dollars a day or 64 dollars per month for the pass and they leave people waiting for hours. They are embarrassingLet's go @Suns https://t.co/ukeV6zxjbq https://t.co/d58iHWFRrHBlack FM Radio Music Station Finally Returning to the Valley of the Sun in Summer 2022!

I'm from Japan. @Suns@AndrewAthias @Mcfraud1983 @Ph1lafaithful @Suns @mikal_bridges Even worse they traded him for a Miami’s 1st rounder which we clearly see didn’t benefit us anymore that Bridges would have.@picjerphoto @TheTradeShow33 @HustlinShowroom @TheJurassicPack @Suns @TheArchiveClub Looking for my new journey this year
Hope if all works out.

So far, I’m looking forward to being an uncle for the first time. Can’t wait to spoil my little nephew@casualtakeking Typical @Suns behavior https://t.co/YkrmjVAeCm@picjerphoto @MertAliYeter1 @TheTradeShow33 @HustlinShowroom @TheJurassicPack @Suns @TheArchiveClub Gonna have a vacation with my belovedThank you @Suns, @SacramentoKings, @ATLHawks! https://t.co/XWSHTAkJIk@picjerphoto @TheTradeShow33 @HustlinShowroom @TheJurassicPack @Suns @TheArchiveClub Looking forward to the Celtics playoff run! ☘️ 

@bbleezy2k3 @Mikeweisberg @CoachAC_NFT @esavy13@picjerphoto @TheTradeShow33 @HustlinShowroom @TheJurassicPack @Suns @TheArchiveClub Gonna change countries for a couple of months. Looking forward to a great summer !Getting the Sun as much needed infused into me blood 🤩🥃👑 @ Phoenix, Arizona https://t.co/KoBnA4u8ErI get that everyone wants to play the Suns in Round 2 but I'm pretty sure we have to go through both Memphis and Phoenix anyways to get to the NBA Finals.It's been three years since the Phoenix Suns fired Igor Kokoskov and brought in Monty Williams, who turned around the franchise with their first finals appearance in 1993 and the first top seed in the NBA since the 2004-05 season. #ValleyProud https://t.co/id6fztjk2J@picjerphoto @TheTradeShow33 @HustlinShowroom @TheJurassicPack @Suns @TheArchiveClub Looking to change things in my life. I ve been in a dark place for a long time.
I am gonna try to get out from it.@ZERO_602 @Suns @DevinBook Lmao rent free. My debate was that if Booker is your mvp for being the best player on the best team, then Mitchel should’ve been your mvp last year for being the best player on the best team. Get back to watching cartoons lil man, maybe one day you’ll eat the big table@phil_shultz @azsose @NBA @DaveKingNBA @Suns My bad, I thought he was saying the refs were on the suns side😅@ScorchinSuns @NStarstate @Suns @mikal_bridges Also I'm not gonna diss on the T Wolves. I haven't forgot where we came from all last decade. 

Besides, I respect the fact that their team is improving and will be in the playoffs this year. I wont shit on the faith they have in their team's improvement like others did to us...@DonDavious @azsose @NBA @DaveKingNBA @Suns And they still have the league’s best record!@DonDavious @azsose @NBA @DaveKingNBA @Suns What are you questioning?  The suns take the least amount of free throws per game of any team in the nba.  Guess what team the entirety of all nba teams averages the most free throws per game against… you guessed it, Phoenix!  8 vs 5 night in night out!@90snbastuff @Suns @NBA @RealSirCharles @KJ_MayorJohnson @cedceballos @Omiller03 @therealTC24 @danielrainge @SunsTK @mwest41 @DanMajerle @LionelHollins14 @StessTheEmcee Suns 90’s Era Were The Best Squad Suns 93@ScorchinSuns @NStarstate @Suns @mikal_bridges To be fair he was in the majority in doubting the Suns. 🤷 You had to watch them regularly to understand how much injuries hindered their growth.

They never had all the key players healthy at once. How do you build chemistry when the lineup changes constantly? Continuity is key.@LegionHoops @ShamsCharania congratulations to the phoenix suns on clinching the nba finals@picjerphoto @pucklum @TheTradeShow33 @HustlinShowroom @TheJurassicPack @Suns @TheArchiveClub TS; Miroglu

To finish all my work and take a vacation. Watching the play-offs on vacation, sleeping, swimming, sleeping, sleeping..@KINGGOATGOAT Bruh now you know I'm A say the Banner Boy Phoenix Suns.@Suns How do we get them in Australia?  😭

Help us International fans out who get up at stupid hours and take time off work to watch our beloved team. 🙏@picjerphoto @TheTradeShow33 @HustlinShowroom @TheJurassicPack @Suns @TheArchiveClub TS: rhenzokuken

Looking forward to complete my first set and I'm aiming for Seeing Stars!💯@sofiasunss think she meant the @utahjazz needed a good humbling. And a humbling is what they got last night. Good job @Suns see y'all tomorrow at the @FootprintCNTR LET'S GO!!!!!!!@KeithATurnerSr6 @NBAcrazystats @NetsDaily @Suns @NBA Yes and the 73 win warriors don’t mean shit because they didn’t win it… stupid ass opinion. Charles Barkley, Patrick Ewing, Steve Nash, John Stockton, Karl Malone…. Their careers mean nothing because no championship right?Congratulations to the Phoenix Suns on reaching their biggest win total of their history but are we supposed to forget that they choked on a fat cock in last year's Finals? Regular season totals don't matter, ask the 73-9 Warriors.@casualtakeking Boston Celtics. But Phoenix Suns are the clear favorites to win it.People hate seeing the @Suns win 🤣 https://t.co/bEptyA5h2EPhoenix Suns are going to the NBA Finals again .@unimockups @UniWatch @PhilHecken @ToddRadom how about a 2 toned arizona diamondbacks hat with the “arizona” script font as the logo using the Phoenix Suns colorway WITH a 2001 world series side patch@CandelariaChano @suns_tutu_fan @Suns_Armband @lindseyrbhair @angelinams112 @Tiffany_Lv_SunS @Suns Good luck fam https://t.co/NMaj3gzhxByo @Suns ima be at the game tomorrow (Saturday vs Kings). my 18th bday is in &gt;2 weeks sooo if y’all could get me a picture (maybe even a jersey) that would be awesome.
