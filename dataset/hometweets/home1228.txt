Bc even if this current warriors team plays the Suns, they have no chance.If the Suns win this year, Phoenix is gone be lit asf.The Korean  Zombie‚Äôs  strategy is similar very similar to the 7 seconds or less Phoenix Suns‚Äô strategy. This is both a complement and a knock. #UFC273@Comineyha11 @Money23Green @CJC9BOSS @warriors @Suns Big 3 isn‚Äôt old yet. A HUGE difference between your early and late 30‚Äôs and they‚Äôre going to be buoyed in the near future by the development of the youngsters.@DogSurfRoadshow @Money23Green @CJC9BOSS @warriors @Suns 5 years ago, I believe you but the warriors are in the past and that's ok. They had a great run.Knicks vs Phoenix Suns who would win?@Comineyha11 @Money23Green @CJC9BOSS @warriors @Suns The same goes for other teams.
