They then played games without lonzo, Lavine, and Caruso in the playoffs, and a rusty Pat Will finally backDaily Trivia

The last time the Memphis Grizzlies advanced to the second round on the NBA Playoffs they played the Golden State Warriors and would end up losing the series 4 games to 2. Who was the Grizzlies leader in points per game during that short playoff run?

https://t.co/zuYjI5eL0qGolden State Warriors V. Memphis Grizzlies 🔥. The Grizzlies are 3-1 against the warriors but this is the playoffs so it's different.

Zero rest excuse 7 months down the line doesn’t hold up, especially when they had, what, 3 weeks less?
2. Know where you are on the court and don’t go 0-6 in OT
3. Can only play the team in front of you. Also they beat the sixers.
4. CP3 played every game + Giannis was hurt

1. Heat with zero rest after finals run the year before 
2. The nets without kyrie (took 7 games and 1/2 shoe size to big for KD to win)
3. A bad lucky hawks team

-called the Grizzlies a talented group that you can't let run like crazy
-he admires what Memphis has done organizationally &amp; said they selected/drafted well and developed well
-called BC and JJJ "bouncy athletic guys"The Golden State Warriors and Memphis Grizzlies series will be a 4-2 in favor of the young lads of Memphis.

They might get swept 🧹 🤷🏽‍♂️@DaranFaust @kirkgoldsberry @Bucks @dallasmavs @MiamiHEAT @celtics @Suns @warriors @memgrizz @chicagobulls @nuggets Hawks and Jazz are definitely worse. An argument could be made they are better than the nets but Hawks/Jazz are locks@memgrizz Bunch of youths gonna end up getting schooled chasing the smoke.@ArcieriJohn @TwoTymes_ @jwash_ @NBA @memgrizz Who draws fouls well on Warriors though? Looney almost never gets to the line. To me the big worry for Warriors is Draymond fouling out. You can talk about Kuminga and Poole driving, but if you start losing bigs because of fouls trying to guard Grizzlies in the paint, that’s bad.@memgrizz Feeling great that the series is over!!!  But I hope they clean up the sloppy play and learn some patience on offense because the next matchup will end badly if they keep playing sloppy ball.Shoutout to former player @konchjitty55 for advancing to the second round of the NBA playoffs with the @memgrizz. 6 big time boards last night!
