Upsets will happen 🤷🤷@OfficialCrowder @MarcHochman and @AlexMSolana are on one and heat nation should be concerned, why I’ve been saying for year they need a guy like a Bradley Beal who’s a scorer. But Pat can’t try to turn him into a defender, Miami has plenty y of that already. Defense never a ?@creative_name00 Tauson had something of a heat stroke apparently. 
I don't now what happened to Kucova, I have not seen her play since the memorable Barty match last year in Miami 👀@Geo305_ @hurricanesmarsh @LakersCanes305 Have you guys thought about Tyreek Hill coming to UM  during off season work outs and running routes or getting in work with @coach_cristobal and his staff.

The Miami sports scene is on fire right now 🔥🔥Teams that are top 11 in both offense and Defense.
1) Utah Jazz
2) Phoenix Suns
3) Memphis Grizzlies
4) Boston Celtics
5) Miami Heat

Every team that has won a title since 2004 has been top 11 in offense and defense. So I guess these are the top contendersI haven’t been this excited for Miami sports since Lebron James signed with the Heat.POINT IS YALL

we shouldn't have to argue what town it is...
