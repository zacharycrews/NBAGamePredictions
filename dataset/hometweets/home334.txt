Yall can't let teams get out here and bullshit.@Nardo2Flashy @JonnyRoccIT @tylerburz @LilKuziVert__ @Keldonburner @7ntry @statmuse @TheTraeYoung @ATLHawks Also Trae must be one of the thinnest players in the NBA he weighs what, 170? So to accomplish what he has while being so small is impressive. Meanwhile Luka is big enough to be an NFL linebacker.@TebowCouch @JonnyRoccIT @tylerburz @LilKuziVert__ @Keldonburner @7ntry @statmuse @TheTraeYoung @ATLHawks yea i should‚Äôve specified i meant teams@Nardo2Flashy @JonnyRoccIT @tylerburz @LilKuziVert__ @Keldonburner @7ntry @statmuse @TheTraeYoung @ATLHawks Well, not entirely, Luka was Rookie of the Year, then First Team All NBA his 2nd and 3rd seasons, which led to the largest rookie contract extension in history ($205M) while Trae wasn‚Äôt, but in terms of leading their teams they‚Äôve had a somewhat similar trajectory.@ToddDupey @ATLLAEV @60thB @statmuse @TheTraeYoung @ATLHawks What the hell is your point? I just named multiple scoring champions that won titles. When did I say every elite scorer won a title? No one is even talking about championships anyway. Thanks for interjecting your irrelevant opinion.@kirkgoldsberry @Timberwolves @warriors @Suns @ATLHawks @utahjazz @Bucks @chicagobulls @BrooklynNets How will an 80 point win change this for the Grizzlies?Atlanta Hawks are a better team, the Knicks are a better team‚Ä¶ the Celtics are a better team‚Ä¶ we hear y‚Äôall https://t.co/vHnRPhdWvv@GunterJPN @imcristian0rtiz @statmuse @TheTraeYoung @ATLHawks I'm guessing you don't watch the Hawks very often. Trae regularly collapses the defense to generate open shots and dunks/layups. 

Steph is the far better 3-pt shooter, but shares the facilitating with Draymond. They're just very different players.@KnotsThoughtz @ATLHawks @TheTraeYoung @UPS This was my whole intent: for it to be shared lol.

Why wasn‚Äôt it ‚Äúhe can‚Äôt lead a team/he has the worst defense in the NBA‚Äù plus getting snubbed for All Star spots.

Hawks was playing with Alex Len, Deandre Bembry, and a 45 year old Vince Carter. WITH Lloyd Pierce as a Coach. Collins was Suspended for like 20 games.
Without Pierce getting Fired, we wouldn‚Äôt sniff a Playoff Run.
We literally had the worse case scenario lol@icetreygoat @imcristian0rtiz @statmuse @TheTraeYoung @ATLHawks one game is what ur using to judge a top 12 player of all time‚Äôs playmaking ability?@ATLHawks Kevin Willis!@JonnyRoccIT @tylerburz @LilKuziVert__ @TebowCouch @Keldonburner @7ntry @statmuse @TheTraeYoung @ATLHawks while that is true, it‚Äôs really not fair to do the same to luka especially since without luka, i think the mavs are the worst team in the nba@LilKuziVert__ @tylerburz @TebowCouch @Keldonburner @7ntry @statmuse @TheTraeYoung @ATLHawks tbf luka has i think the highest or second highest PPG in playoffs of all time. he rises in the playoffs. just terrible luck going against that team#youtube Trae Young on CONNECTION with Kevin Huerter, PLAYING together since HIGH SCHOOL | Atlanta Hawks https://t.co/jbJ4sUHKMd.Exclusive J.
