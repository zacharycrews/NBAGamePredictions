Hawks get: Barnes and Bagley 
Sac gets: Gallo, Delon, Cam, &amp; a 2022 FRP

Pros: For Atl, it's consolidating and taking a flier on Bagley.

@ATLHawks 6 game loosing streak to a 7 game winning streak ending with the @memgrizz who broke records tonight against @okcthunder... #sociosATL@GunterJPN @imcristian0rtiz @statmuse @TheTraeYoung @ATLHawks I appreciate your stance as there's Steph bias.@ESPNPR @bethmowins @espn @CassidyHubbarth @sixers @ATLHawks Congratulations Beth@ESPNPR @espnSteveLevy @bethmowins @espn @CassidyHubbarth @sixers @ATLHawks Too bad her voice is too annoying to listen to. They should have given the gig to Rachel Nichols.@ATLHawks @christuckerreal 😂 my boy !@SociosHoops @socios @okcthunder @memgrizz If @ATLHawks  beat the @memgrizz by 32 points 2 games ago, then that would mean it would have been a 79 - 182 if #IceColdTrae and the #ATLHawkGang had been there... #JustTalkingTrash #TrueToAtlanta #ATLBornAndRaised
#NeverBackDown@ATLHawks @Hennessy Hey anyone know where I can watch our pre-game pressers LIVE?@ATLHawks Sweet LouNew tumblr post: "#NBA2K22 Boston Celtics vs. Atlanta Hawks MyLeague PS4 GAMES by..." https://t.co/FWF2dMMW0y ifttt, youtube@ESPNPR @bethmowins @espn @CassidyHubbarth @sixers @ATLHawks Beth Mowins is so legit….this is significant…she has called everything like the pro she is…Do the damn thing Beth….props to you!come to atlanta hawks @joshgiddey@NBAOfficial Real shit, I am a Bulls fan and don't give a fuck about the @okcthunder but I got floor seats to @sixers versus @ATLHawks tomorrow night and people pay a lot of real fucking money for these fucking games. Yall can't let teams get out here and bullshit.@Nardo2Flashy @JonnyRoccIT @tylerburz @LilKuziVert__ @Keldonburner @7ntry @statmuse @TheTraeYoung @ATLHawks Also Trae must be one of the thinnest players in the NBA he weighs what, 170? So to accomplish what he has while being so small is impressive. Meanwhile Luka is big enough to be an NFL linebacker.@TebowCouch @JonnyRoccIT @tylerburz @LilKuziVert__ @Keldonburner @7ntry @statmuse @TheTraeYoung @ATLHawks yea i should’ve specified i meant teams@Nardo2Flashy @JonnyRoccIT @tylerburz @LilKuziVert__ @Keldonburner @7ntry @statmuse @TheTraeYoung @ATLHawks Well, not entirely, Luka was Rookie of the Year, then First Team All NBA his 2nd and 3rd seasons, which led to the largest rookie contract extension in history ($205M) while Trae wasn’t, but in terms of leading their teams they’ve had a somewhat similar trajectory.@ToddDupey @ATLLAEV @60thB @statmuse @TheTraeYoung @ATLHawks What the hell is your point? I just named multiple scoring champions that won titles. When did I say every elite scorer won a title? No one is even talking about championships anyway. Thanks for interjecting your irrelevant opinion.@kirkgoldsberry @Timberwolves @warriors @Suns @ATLHawks @utahjazz @Bucks @chicagobulls @BrooklynNets How will an 80 point win change this for the Grizzlies?Atlanta Hawks are a better team, the Knicks are a better team… the Celtics are a better team… we hear y’all https://t.co/vHnRPhdWvv@GunterJPN @imcristian0rtiz @statmuse @TheTraeYoung @ATLHawks I'm guessing you don't watch the Hawks very often. Trae regularly collapses the defense to generate open shots and dunks/layups. 

Steph is the far better 3-pt shooter, but shares the facilitating with Draymond. They're just very different players.@KnotsThoughtz @ATLHawks @TheTraeYoung @UPS This was my whole intent: for it to be shared lol. Just wanted to bring this meme into existence since it wasn’t before 😊@brian26806914 @statmuse @TheTraeYoung @ATLHawks Stop being a weirdo and making this about curry no one cares.THIS TWEET IS MAJOR!!!!! Quiet as Hell !!! @ATLHawks https://t.co/gB66QqHWlN@GunterJPN @imcristian0rtiz @statmuse @TheTraeYoung @ATLHawks It. It literally does what? You’re creating offense. And if he’s getting the assist vs a pass to assist HES literally a better playmaker@thefamuzlayla Atlanta hawks correct?@kirkgoldsberry @Timberwolves @warriors @Suns @ATLHawks @utahjazz @Bucks @chicagobulls @BrooklynNets @koch_corn wolves rising@mazin_so @souijaakk @Bucket_man21 @starscryptt @Obito_1337 @statmuse @TheTraeYoung @ATLHawks Gimme yo hand king… ninjas just saying anything on nba twitter these days smh https://t.co/JgSRHE38vU@statmuse @TheTraeYoung @ATLHawks no need to reference random stats to prove that a player is good@GunterJPN @imcristian0rtiz @statmuse @TheTraeYoung @ATLHawks Steph isn’t a pg@ESPNPR @AlexSimsTV @bethmowins @espn @CassidyHubbarth @sixers @ATLHawks Her voice is the most irritating thing in the world .

On team that doesn’t have true #2 player. He’s like 8th in shot attempts too.

Why wasn’t it “he can’t lead a team/he has the worst defense in the NBA” plus getting snubbed for All Star spots. Why Luka is on  MVP lists &amp; not Trae, ETC.@JOShMuzic @statmuse @TheTraeYoung @ATLHawks Focusing on his hair like some hoez 😭😆@GWPtheTrilogy @statmuse @TheTraeYoung @ATLHawks Trae drugged that overweight out of shape boy head to head ☠😭😆Ya’ll know Trae Young is in the NBA right? If you think Draymond Green has been better than Trae Young then maybe you forgot the Atlanta Hawks exist. https://t.co/WFrhAjmQa6@sogreat1989 @brian26806914 @statmuse @TheTraeYoung @ATLHawks Exactly!!!!! 💯🎯 lmmfao take the L like a man! https://t.co/9rkxoGOc6A@ToddDupey @ATLLAEV @60thB @statmuse @TheTraeYoung @ATLHawks When Jordan, Kobe, Steph, LeBron, etc., we're winning championships, none of them were averaging 17 points.@ATLHawks This guy it’s definitely this guy come on it’s gotta be this guy, Lou Hudson, right?! https://t.co/JhuLZ8aYnN@KDotMeekBron @ATLHawks Part time plumbers that would still wash LeBum@detroitmason @ESPNPR @MarcJSpears @bethmowins @espn @CassidyHubbarth @sixers @ATLHawks You must, you tweeted......@ATLHawks Dwight Howard finally getting the recognition@JonnyRoccIT @tylerburz @LilKuziVert__ @TebowCouch @Keldonburner @7ntry @statmuse @TheTraeYoung @ATLHawks obviously the hawks are ass without trae that year but i’m saying both are equally ass so i don’t see why if y’all saw how unfair it was to blame trae for his team being bad y’all should do it to luka. also i wonder if the coach change for the mavs will work like it did for y’all@Nardo2Flashy @tylerburz @LilKuziVert__ @TebowCouch @Keldonburner @7ntry @statmuse @TheTraeYoung @ATLHawks Bro without Trae. Hawks was playing with Alex Len, Deandre Bembry, and a 45 year old Vince Carter. WITH Lloyd Pierce as a Coach. Collins was Suspended for like 20 games.
Without Pierce getting Fired, we wouldn’t sniff a Playoff Run.
We literally had the worse case scenario lol@icetreygoat @imcristian0rtiz @statmuse @TheTraeYoung @ATLHawks one game is what ur using to judge a top 12 player of all time’s playmaking ability?@ATLHawks Kevin Willis!@JonnyRoccIT @tylerburz @LilKuziVert__ @TebowCouch @Keldonburner @7ntry @statmuse @TheTraeYoung @ATLHawks while that is true, it’s really not fair to do the same to luka especially since without luka, i think the mavs are the worst team in the nba@LilKuziVert__ @tylerburz @TebowCouch @Keldonburner @7ntry @statmuse @TheTraeYoung @ATLHawks tbf luka has i think the highest or second highest PPG in playoffs of all time. he rises in the playoffs. just terrible luck going against that team#youtube Trae Young on CONNECTION with Kevin Huerter, PLAYING together since HIGH SCHOOL | Atlanta Hawks https://t.co/jbJ4sUHKMd.Exclusive J.
