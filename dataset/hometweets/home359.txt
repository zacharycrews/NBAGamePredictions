All the screen and pass stuff in crunch time doesnt work against great defenses ex: @suns@1011ap4 @KlayForTrey @Suns Time for a update buddy@Joshualuvsjesus Yeah totally agree.

So lazy. So boring! https://t.co/P23IBoJ1Pa12/5/19 – Scoring 21p in the 3Q alone, Devin Booker finished w/44p/9a/8r, leading the Phoenix #Suns (who blew a 105-85 4Q lead) to a hard fought 139-132 OT win at the New Orleans Pelicans, Monty Williams' 1st return as a HC. Rubio: 13p/15a/6r. Oubre: 14p/15r/4b. #ValleyProud https://t.co/JpfOQ0HRkf@attypure @Billando @ZonaHoops_ @Suns Not to mention all of those were on the road for the second half of the b2b. Warriors were at home both nights.HONESTLY speaking …and not trying to sound like a “homer”…but BOTH @AZCardinals AND @Suns have outstanding chances and even likelihood to BOTH win it ALL!!! 🏆 🏆 https://t.co/hy7dJColuEMy concern is that we live in Phoenix and the summers are HOT. That metal is going to get super hot in the summer. We have a lot of tree coverage in the backyard, though, so I think we can move them so they don’t get the scorching afternoon sun. Temps get SO high here, tho. 😬@Suns sign me 😹 https://t.co/qL2k3EFDa3What I remember most about the Phoenix Suns last season...

"Suns in 4!!!" 😤
#ValleyProud #NBA2K22 https://t.co/wBRtqUpyi5Maybe that racist masogynsitic asshat @Suns owner Robert Sarver should be more worried about the NBA investigation then treating his customers like fucking Typhoid Mary.Glad to see @Suns management has their heads up their asses still. I think if I’d known they started this mask nazi bullshit again I would’ve forgone going to #TSO2021. Did you know @KariLake they’ve reconstituted a mask mandate inside @FootprintCNTR cause I sure didn’t.12/5/07 – Steve Nash set a season-high in assists for the 2nd game in a row, finishing w/10p/18a and Leandro Barbosa scored 35p of the bench as the Phoenix #Suns used a 45p 3Q to blow out the Raptors in Toronto, 136-123. Marion: 10p/14r. STAT: 25p/6r. TOR: Ford: 27p. #ValleyProud https://t.co/W0XYrMfvUA
