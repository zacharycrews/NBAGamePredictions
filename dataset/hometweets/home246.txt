Single worst decision by Kings ever.Hello @SacramentoKings , today I would like to make a couple suggestions to become a 70-12 win team.

The Sacramento Kings:
- have not defeated the Jazz since November 1, 2019
- are currently on a six-game losing streak vs Utah
- hold a 6-22 record vs Utah since the 2013-14 season

Neat!Plus I was lucky enough to be there for the Robert Horry game against the Sacramento Kings... Several NBA Finals games... Sat by dozens of A-listers... Annoyed almost every single one.

Good Morning 
Quick question 
Is Luke Walton gone yet?
Asking for a friend …. Actually asking for myselfI want to take my dad to a Sacramento Kings game 

At Kings games … do you have to show VIRTUAL vaccine cards or do they allow the paper copy?

My 82 year old dad has a flip phone and has NO clue what a QR code is lol 

Go Kings! @Golden1Center@MarketWatch Took my twins to the @SacramentoKings game last night for less than $50. But okay....@SeanCunningham said it well on the The Kings Best podcast with @James_HamNBA Thursday … 

“Most families really only get to go to one game a year because of prices.”

@SacramentoKings here ya go :)@andreynuke @SacramentoKings That’s cool bro if this about me unfollowing u cuz I don’t wanna associate with someone who feels the need to bring skin color into things that’s fine@CarmichaelDave my wife told me during last nights game that she feels sorry for me, The amount of time and money I’ve spent as @SacramentoKings fans and they just never get better.

The point is the Yay Area is starving for professional sports and I don't want to see another city get the next NFL over Oakland.I'm not sure what's more confusing...Luke Walton STILL having one of only 30 available NBA head coaching jobs or Jason Kidd getting ANOTHER NBA head coaching job after his performance in prior roles.

The Maloof family, who owned the Kings and the Monarchs, refocused on the Kings while the W sought out new owners, but ultimately failed.

I mean, some coaches have it and some don’t. Walton is the worst in the league at in game adjustments. He doesn’t know how to utilize players strengths. Instead he tries to force them into situations they’re not strong at.@KingsForever94 @FCartoscelli3 They shoudve won in 2002! it can be done!!…Chris Webber 2.0 is sitting In Philadelphia waiting for kings to pull the trigger and save his career.

Full Locked On Kings pod coming soon. https://t.co/6Cy52RNqL3@damienbarling Once the Kings lose against Utah, management will look ridiculous if they keep Walton. They knew what they were doing when the stories about Walton's status came out. #sacramentokings #SacramentoProud #NBA@momoragan The players claim it's not on the coach, but their play has not improved. They have certainly heard reports about Walton's future. They must know he's finished here.

They know he's a dead man walking. #sacramentokings #sacramentoproud #nba #NBATwitter@Robdw18W @HeuristicLineup Firing won't help the win totals, but haven't the Kings painted themselves into a corner with Walton?

(AP) — Pascal Siakam scored 18 of his season-high 32 points in the first half and the Toronto Raptors continued their recent dominance in Sacramento, thumping the Kings 108-89 on Friday night. https://t.co/7sB6oBSoAb@BoeDoe_ @SacramentoKings Okay, you’re right lol@pand_duh @SacramentoKings I’m a Magic’s fan…you’ll be iight lol@ards_yt @DrDraiders @VTownGotSmoke @VicTafur @LibbySchaaf @NFL @SacramentoKings They still don't have a decent stadium and are not able to build a new one, so the problem is still there. If the Bay Area ever gets a second NFL team, it will go to San Jose and they will most likely share Levi Stadium with the 49ers. Oakland is going the same way as Pottstown.@FCartoscelli3 Will say that this generation of fans seems much less patient than previous generations of Kings fans. This is a good thing.

Is enough and start winning basketball games, again and compete for a playoff spot in the NBA playoffs kings fans deserve better.

More minutes for @Rich_Holmes22 !!The Sacramento Kings played basketball tonight. It was not a fun time.
https://t.co/HfjucGAKcN@willarchambault @SacramentoKings We’ll take him 😭Fire Luke Walton. Fire Luke Walton. Fire Luke Walton. Fire Luke Walton.

I think the Sacramento Kings should fire Luke Walton.

https://t.co/IIuYCTQkL5Sacramento Kings Twitter refreshing their screens all night after the game https://t.co/RmVC65fj3USacramento Kings fans really hyped up Terence Davis last season to get him fazed out this season 😂I hope they fire Luke Walton within the hour…I tweet this from Texas as a @SacramentoKings fan3. 8-0. After a big showing in the first half, Pascal Siakam hit the Kings with 8 unanswered points to open up the third quarter. The All-Star forward pounded Sacramento for 32 points and 8 rebounds. He helped push the Raptors lead as high as 29 in the third.2. Torched. The Kings selected Gary Trent Jr. with the No. 37 overall pick in the 2018 NBA Draft. They traded him away before ever letting him step on the floor in Sacramento, which was a mistake. Trent lit the Kings up for 18 of his 23 points in the first half.1. Game plan gone wrong. The Raptors love to overplay, get in the passing lanes and they foul a ton. The Kings took advantage of this fact, at least in theory. Sacramento got to the free throw line early and often, but failed to capitalize, hitting just 13-for-20 from the stripe.Step right up Alvin Gentry! You're the next coach of the Sacramento Kings!Games like tonight definitely don’t help Luka Walton who is on the “hot seat” as the Kings lose 108-89 to the Raptors in Sacramento. 

Pascal Siakam had his best game of the season with 32 PTS and 8 REB. Gary Trent Jr. continues to play well with 23 PTS (5-11 3PT).@SacramentoKings @DialpadHQ Lol "Sactown" is so 🌽🏀

Just stopI can confirm that Monte McNair of the Sacramento Kings is having human resources draft the termination paperwork for soon to be former head coach Luke Walton. 
Luke isn't expected to have any suitors in the league and will likely be relinquished to coaching his children's teams.So I’ve basically been paying $700/ year for YouTubeTV just to watch the @SacramentoKings. I think I’m going to reclaim that spend. I could pay someone less than that to punch me in the taint a couple times a week.This city deserves better, this arena deserves better, and most of all, the fans deserve better from the Sacramento Kings.THE SACRAMENTO KINGS SUCK, THERE IS NI HOPE FOR THIS TEAM… BLOW IT UP AGAINAt some point, season tickets to the @SacramentoKings games should include open bar privileges.@47Speaklife @SacramentoKings Embarrassment to the city.This is  Basketball hell @SacramentoKingsIf you’re at the @Golden1Center I want to hear you BOO as loud as you can when the game is over. @SacramentoKings@SacramentoKings @ArdenFair Hey @SacramentoKings. Why would I pay for this garbage?Siakam actually owns the Sacramento Kings@sactownroyalty @SacramentoKings That’s was a terrible debut.Being a Sacramento kings fan feels like..

44-24.
And the @Raptors have 8 blocked shots.
Wow.Everyone talks about the obvious mistake of passing on Luka, let us not forget we drafted Gary Trent Jr. and traded him on draft night for two future 2nd round draft picks. Which of those two second rounders is lighting it up for the Sacramento Kings??Curious when the  @SacramentoKings will realize Luke Walton ain’t the guy. Feel badly for the fans and people who pay money to support this 🐶💩This @SacramentoKings team is a complete joke right now behind coach Walton. When are you going to get rid of this 🤡 already? #SacramentoProud #sacramentokings #sactown #sackings #NBATwitter #nba@ESPN1320 @DeuceMason #SacramentoKings Damn, team playing like they want Luke to get fired.

I say that with all due respect, he isn't cut out for this. 
It isn't fair to the fans or players to further accept mediocrity. 
The city of Sacramento deserves better.
