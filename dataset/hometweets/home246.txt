The Sacramento Kings:
- have not defeated the Jazz since November 1, 2019
- are currently on a six-game losing streak vs Utah
- hold a 6-22 record vs Utah since the 2013-14 season

Neat!Plus I was lucky enough to be there for the Robert Horry game against the Sacramento Kings... Several NBA Finals games... Sat by dozens of A-listers... Annoyed almost every single one.

The score is misleading, the Raptors should have won by 30+ that‚Äôs how good the entire team was tonight.@Coach_Popovic @willarchambault @SacramentoKings I can list you other misses by the Kings.

I really like a LOT of them. They just seriously need a new coach.@Sportsnet It‚Äôs yessir from here on out @SacramentoKings https://t.co/QaM6w0XT7wLuke, it‚Äôs obviously not all on you, but like the coaches before you‚Äôll be the sacrificial lamb. Best of luck to you in the future. Maybe this time the @SacramentoKings will interview more than one person! Or maybe A person, I don‚Äôt believe Luke interviewed. https://t.co/T3CFjohjLu@SacramentoKings Bad coaching is the reason for this team losing games. This team should be better prepared to compete. It‚Äôs obvious that length at the Raptor 3,4,5 spot + zone would shutdown the inside game &amp; lead to fast breaks.Toronto #Raptors 108 - Sacramento Kings 89 | Final

https://t.co/IIuYCTQkL5Sacramento Kings Twitter refreshing their screens all night after the game https://t.co/RmVC65fj3USacramento Kings fans really hyped up Terence Davis last season to get him fazed out this season üòÇI hope they fire Luke Walton within the hour‚Ä¶I tweet this from Texas as a @SacramentoKings fan3. 8-0. After a big showing in the first half, Pascal Siakam hit the Kings with 8 unanswered points to open up the third quarter. The All-Star forward pounded Sacramento for 32 points and 8 rebounds. He helped push the Raptors lead as high as 29 in the third.2. Torched. The Kings selected Gary Trent Jr. with the No. 37 overall pick in the 2018 NBA Draft. They traded him away before ever letting him step on the floor in Sacramento, which was a mistake. Trent lit the Kings up for 18 of his 23 points in the first half.1. Game plan gone wrong. The Raptors love to overplay, get in the passing lanes and they foul a ton. The Kings took advantage of this fact, at least in theory. Sacramento got to the free throw line early and often, but failed to capitalize, hitting just 13-for-20 from the stripe.Step right up Alvin Gentry! You're the next coach of the Sacramento Kings!Games like tonight definitely don‚Äôt help Luka Walton who is on the ‚Äúhot seat‚Äù as the Kings lose 108-89 to the Raptors in Sacramento. 

Pascal Siakam had his best game of the season with 32 PTS and 8 REB. Gary Trent Jr. continues to play well with 23 PTS (5-11 3PT).@SacramentoKings @DialpadHQ Lol "Sactown" is so üåΩüèÄ

Just stopI can confirm that Monte McNair of the Sacramento Kings is having human resources draft the termination paperwork for soon to be former head coach Luke Walton. 
Luke isn't expected to have any suitors in the league and will likely be relinquished to coaching his children's teams.So I‚Äôve basically been paying $700/ year for YouTubeTV just to watch the @SacramentoKings. I think I‚Äôm going to reclaim that spend. I could pay someone less than that to punch me in the taint a couple times a week.This city deserves better, this arena deserves better, and most of all, the fans deserve better from the Sacramento Kings.THE SACRAMENTO KINGS SUCK, THERE IS NI HOPE FOR THIS TEAM‚Ä¶ BLOW IT UP AGAINAt some point, season tickets to the @SacramentoKings games should include open bar privileges.@47Speaklife @SacramentoKings Embarrassment to the city.This is  Basketball hell @SacramentoKingsIf you‚Äôre at the @Golden1Center I want to hear you BOO as loud as you can when the game is over. @SacramentoKings@SacramentoKings @ArdenFair Hey @SacramentoKings.

Wow.Everyone talks about the obvious mistake of passing on Luka, let us not forget we drafted Gary Trent Jr. and traded him on draft night for two future 2nd round draft picks.

Luke can‚Äôt adjust to game flow or the other teams adjustments.  Luke doesn‚Äôt put players in position to utilize strengths.  @SacramentoKings @Viveküí£ Sacramento kings kick off the season running whit 2-0 blowout games lead by their pg No Lies King he kinda remind‚Äôs me of de‚ÄôAaron foxüê∫ https://t.co/X4FNcVD1ISALERT: New high roller bet posted!

Only person missing is @streetsavvyGMG #sactown @SacramentoKings https://t.co/lbqELlDZWZ#Sacramento Kings - Toronto Raptors ‚òÖ #1er cuarto terminado: 27 - 30 by: #SofaScoreWhat's going on with Referee #51 and @SacramentoKings #40? Every time a @Raptors player passes him, he calls a foul. It's ridiculous. Ten fouls in the first quarter. #biasBagley in. The fans cheer. 

This is the norm. 

Twitter isn't real life. 

The general Kings fan truly wants Bagley to succeed and succeed in SacramentoALERT: New high roller bet posted!

All they can do is set screens for Buddy, and run pick &amp; rolls ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è otherwise they just run around in circles waiting for someone to get open. Am I missing anything?Raptors Pascal Siakam‚Äôs improvement over the years is due in part to @SacramentoKings asst coach  @ricohinesbball who‚Äôs in the lab with Siakam every summer in Los Angeles where he works out. 
Facts üíØ@SacramentoKings fakeSacramento tipped off about 15 minutes ago, so the Kings will be working for the next 2 hours or so to get past the Toronto Raptors.
