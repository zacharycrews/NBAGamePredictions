Trio will make a giant wave tonight!@HardenzBetta @warriors win a real ring like harden… oh wait@warriors CARRY BOTH HALVES PLSIf the #NBAFinals series score were different, the most likely possibility would have been @warriors playing well in Q4 of Game 1 and winning it. Dubs up 3-1 was much more likely than any other score. All the Celtics fanboys in the media have no idea what they are talking about.Stephen Curry led the Warriors to a thrilling Game 4 win to tie the series 2-2. Can Golden State keep the momentum going or will the Celtics grab control?

He usually ANCHORS the defense. They've got 2 Centers (including him, and they've got plenty of wings), but to my point, he's been guarding Jaylen Brown a lot with some success THIS series.

Kerr makes watching Warriors unenjoyable, and stars should be concerned.@JimJone50575409 @georgewrighster @Commanders @GEICO @warriors No, I think people are trying to trigger some sort of Helter skelter. But democracy is thankfully too entrenched (or we’re too fat and happy) for revolution just yet.@warriors @957thegame @ESPNRadio @HPE There isn’t a team or fan base in the country that wouldn’t take Steph Curry. They hate him because they don’t have him. Can you imagine if we had Jayson Tatum instead of Draymond Green.

I love your honesty and I want Curry to be FMVP too but that honor goes to someone on the winning team. 
Curry always puts team before the individual.
The FMVP would mean nothing to him without the title.

Boston is a way  deeper team..Game 5 (much like Game 4) is also a must-win for the #Warriors tonight.

Your opinion is that the NBA is the “best at basketball”… good for you, doesn’t meant anything. Championships are based on facts, who has beat who, not your speculation 🤣🤡with the Golden State Warriors, I would have flown to Vegas and thrown down a huge bet. They certainly have exceeded my expectations. I know a bunch of bandwagoners got them winning the Finals but I'll be okay this year if they don't.

Doesn’t rebound at a high level. And a lot of players are great passers passing to 2 of the greatest shooters to ever live.The Celtics are looking to bounce back like they've done all postseason in a crucial Game 5 against the Golden State Warriors.

#GoldenStateWarriors https://t.co/HFF4xsuqPY@LASportsFanatic @LegionHoops @FrankCaliendo I don’t disagree with your points. The lakers did shoot the 3 well but not as well as the 2017 warriors. % were the same but Golden state was able to maintain that number at a much higher volume. Not arguing the other stuff but it was a casual move to use % only is all I’m sayin@CBSSports @warriors @StephenCurry30 Why is age 34 the cutoff?And yes i am a @warriors hater and a @StephenCurry30 hater @bpthegenius @centurion1911 

At least I accept and admit it! 😂@ProCityHoops everyone is acting like Golden State Warriors can't win with Draymond on the floor.

https://t.co/DJIcYBXU7Y@J_Hill93 @Raptors @MattGrieco @NBA All good. Warriors needed KD to win 2 championships against LeBron. LeBronto was in Golden State before it was in Toronto. #BlewAThreeOneLead@celtics @celtics &gt; @warriors It's that simple ... Let's adjust it, and you will have the outcome we are all expecting #NBA75 @NBA#BostonCeltics v #GoldenStateWarriors  = Ratings Gold.

Despite having a hefty docket of competition (#TopGun at the theaters, #ObiWan  and #StrangerThings streaming) the #NBAFinals Game 1 was up 37% (!!) over last year's Game 1.

ABC is 🙏for a Game 7.

Golden state was elite on that end this season before the injuries piled up.Hmmmm.....A prime Charles Barkley on the the current @warriors team or  @Money23Green on a Suns team during a heavy Jordan era?

Who would have more of an impact on their team?  Charles is seriously underrated....can't hide behind that ring argument 🤷🏾‍♂️
