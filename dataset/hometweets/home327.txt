But I still think he is unfit for United.@MrTopNews1 @CAPTAINPEARLNYK @NBA_NewYork How is it unfair. Rose is the Knicks best player. He’s a better playmaker offensive and defensive player than Kemba and it’s not close.

Is this [Knicks-Nets] brewing into an actual rivalry in New York City?" @michaelsmith 

[👀 pause 👀]

"No." 😆 @AshNicoleMoss@CAPTAINPEARLNYK @MrTopNews1 @NBA_NewYork How Kemba spoke during post game conference of Suns game was a bit eye catching as he mentioned Suns ball movement and selflessness and some thought that was a dig at Knicks (shouldn’t).

Then ended up being Kemba last game.

But there’s also strategic reasons as to why Kemba out@NBA_NewYork Thank You. This makes me better at being that Knicks Fan that can go toe to toe with the best of em on New York basketball. #PushLetsGoShaq Shares A Message to Julius Randle After The Brooklyn Nets Defeat New York Knicks | NBA on TNT https://t.co/EPVm7YW9JP@nyknicks @nyknicks Can the New York Knicks follow me?
