Got tickets for The Houston rockets vs the pelicans for this Sunday... I'm not even sure what sport it is for.. 😂😂December 3, 2019: Houston #Rockets SG James Harden dropped 50 PTS with the most FTM (24) in a game without a miss but had a 4th Qtr dunk that went through the hoop and came out which was incorrectly waved off by the refs, sparking the Spurs comeback who won in 2OT https://t.co/GelW1DyCHl@HoustonRockets Play him more for the love of god or better yet start him@OrlandoMagic @HoustonRockets @969thegame @The_ColeAnthony Alright guys, let’s play with some pace and space tonight and get this dub!

But, still maintaining blue in the colorway makes it unsuitable for the Rockets.@Isaiah_Osiris @Jcool0 @JakeLFischer Stotts was a Houston Rockets player in 1980 soThe Houston Rockets James Harden had 64 hotdogs in his pockets while playing.@Rocketsplsswin @ChrisMcKnightTX @HoustonRockets ...yep!
That tells you how truly unredeemable the pinstripes are.

But, honestly, the pinstripes, as ridiculous as they are, are not nearly as big a problem as randomly adding blue to the colorway. It simply has no place in the Rockets' brand.@Rocketsplsswin @ChrisMcKnightTX @HoustonRockets Ok that's "fair".

But I would contest that the shark rocket was not actually a good idea, as it modeled after WWII Air Force bombers, which is entirely the wrong field of aeronautics.

Those were missiles not rockets.

At least the Gemini joints were spacebound, just ugly.@HoustonRockets I didn’t know you could be less athletic then fat Jokic@Rocketsplsswin @ChrisMcKnightTX @HoustonRockets Though, I'm still gonna have to slide these in below those (but still above the pinstripes): https://t.co/9jMVNkVKLD@hateupton @HPbasketball Eh, I don’t think it’s a Morey thing. I don’t even think it’s a Rockets thing.

It’s a general Houston thing.@Court_Cousins @OrlandoMagic @HoustonRockets @969thegame @The_ColeAnthony Easily@Rocketsplsswin @ChrisMcKnightTX @HoustonRockets But, yeah, the drippy R has been the 2nd worst thing, behind the laughably bad cartoon rocket, they've ever tried.
Even as hackneyed pandering to Yao's fanbase, it was a poor facsimile of Chinese calligraphy clumsily crossed with the "look" of jet propulsion.@HoustonRockets Just forfeit now @OrlandoMagic@HoustonRockets LET'S FUCKING GO 🤘🏼🚀@kahler012 @OrlandoMagic @HoustonRockets @969thegame @The_ColeAnthony So I should bet the Cole over 20.5 pts?@jkubatko @HoustonRockets Was the game James dunked the ball and the ref called it a miss!@Rocketsplsswin @ChrisMcKnightTX @HoustonRockets 🤣😂 while you're right about the latter, you're on a sparsely populated island with your love of the pinstripes.
They are WIDELY regarded as the worst. https://t.co/mZAdVEab5u@OrlandoMagic @HoustonRockets @969thegame @The_ColeAnthony Cole dropping 29 tonight and Franz getting 27GAME DAY!  #Rockets

It looks epic at center court.@HoustonRockets Even though blue doesn't belong in the Rocket's colorway at all (with the exception of the nod to the Oilers from last year), the warm up jacket is the only thing decent about this whole hideous pinstripe mess.

It was an arena disagreement with the previous Rockets owner.If Houston (probably with Rockets owner Fertitta as buyer) acquired the Arizona Coyotes NHL hockey team, Houstonians most want the name changed to the Houston Aeros.
