Think nets could lose but don’t think it’s automatic lol. Have to have a little faith. Motivation to avoid play in is hopefully thereIf @BrooklynNets have to play the @sixers in the #NBAPlayoffs, they will have Kyrie who can't play the home games and Ben Simmons who probably won't play in the away games. It will all be on @KDTrey5 again. Just a total circus!!@JeriTsaiNets @BrooklynNets They always do that for the opposing team@BrooklynNets We need stretch players for the stretch run. All the best today. Get some reinforcements before other players burn outI’m afraid we have no choice but to liquidate and contract the Brooklyn Nets due to their previous Russian connectionsPraying for everyone that supports Brooklyn nets to find peace.Mental health is just as important to the physical body as a bone break would be. Talking heads crowing that "there is nothing physically wrong" with #BenSimmons should stick to just being wrong about sports.

As I remember, the teachers union in NYC was vehemently opposed to that (for good reason) and if this was done to distract, it was to keep blowback over the end to a minimum.@MyCousinJoe @TheNetsJunkie @NBA90s @BrooklynNets Awesome my guy !@kneary22 I am not remotely worried about Brooklyn. I think the Nets are done. Way more worried about Heat, Sixers, Celtics. Then Bulls, Cavs, Raptors. I think the Nets are about as dangerous as the Hornets.@BrooklynNets @BenSimmons25 @KDTrey5 @AndreDrummond @Patty_Mills @24_camthomas I need Drum to get his dreads back 😭😭
