He's been consistently in the minus for majority of the year. It's showing that the rockets play better when he's not playing.James Harden will face the Rockets in Houston without the help of Kevin Durant.
https://t.co/WpobYPxy2l@DieHrdSportsInc @HoustonRockets He was doing really good on the bulls game before getting injured. Maybe he practice being more efficient and got better at it now?If the rockets lose to a hobbled nets team after fans boasting about a win streak, it's gonna be rox slander time.

If James harden loses to a tanking rockets team, it's gonna be harden slander time.

Either way Houston fans both win and lose I guess https://t.co/QNNvwYyZj1"If you would not trust Houston Rocket or Cincinnati Red with your wallet, you could at least imagine reading them on a list of people who got gut-shot while trying to hijack a steamboat in 1888 and died of sepsis in a flophouse a week later."
