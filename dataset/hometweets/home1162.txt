At 6-7, Hall has strong playmaking skills as a potential point forward and can provide offense both from the post or from three when left open. His playmaking can be great for ATL.

OLD SCHOOL ATLANTA HAWKSThe @NBA literally hates us.

(And on top of the 17 in march) we even had back to back games (plural)  BECAUSE OTHER TEAMS had covid issues, and we did not get 1 break during the "covid-outbreak21-22."

They hate us. Cold take
@ATLHawks @929TheGame #TrueToAtlanta @TheTraeYoung https://t.co/Sx9JZyLTsQ@HawksMuse @statmuse @ATLHawks Would not complain if Gallo + Hunter + Pick or 2 were dealt for a truly elite wing, however. Think you need to ride with clint for a while longer before you fully give OO the keys. Bogi + Kev work too well with Trae to deal. Team needs to add smart defenders on the wing tho
