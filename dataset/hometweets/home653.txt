@MiamiHEAT Yessuh… glad to see @Bam1of1 back! 💪🏽@alirazaa888 @MiamiHEAT No he isn't. He had one good season and got grossly over paid. Strus shoots the better. Can create his own shot. Defends and rebounds. There is no logical way you can defend starting Robinson over strus unless strus is injured.
