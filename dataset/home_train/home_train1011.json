    "441": "@Mischakatja @rjerome217 @umdet3 @overtime @DetroitPistons @CadeCunningham_ His TOs are def a concern for me, while some can be blamed by the talent around him I can't give him a free pass there though.He does have a loose dribble at time and can try too tough of passes but if the assists go up to offset that they won't look as bad.",

Wouldn\u2019t be bad if he had better efficiency scoring\u2026 Cade had  a bad assist-TO in college too. We\u2019ll see if that changes over career when Pistons hopefully get better talent",

    "449": "@Mischakatja @rjerome217 @umdet3 @overtime @DetroitPistons @CadeCunningham_ My case is their record with him vs. without him. If he has a negative impact shouldn't that mean the team plays worse with him? Also with all his teammates shooting under 40% he doesnt get the assists he otherwise would so his Assist to TO ratio suffers.",

Their bout against the Lakers in the finals back in the 2000s was a legendary underdog story."
