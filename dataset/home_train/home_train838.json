this guy thought you meant Portland had the right to sign him above anyone else like Portland has first dibs on him or something like a restricted free agent not that we have the right to go above salary of most teams like what actual bird rights are Just confused", "375": "With all the trades that made right now I think it clear that they trying to gain draft picks and clear cap space So maybe
