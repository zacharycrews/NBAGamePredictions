All TV revenues are pooled and split equally among each team, the reason why L.A. went without a team for so long &amp; why small market teams can compete.  An aside, the Rams are owned by a Walmart heir, who also owns Arsenal, Denver Nuggets &amp; others.#Celtics win!! ☘️☘️ The Boston Celtics defeat the Denver nuggets 108-102

Is the market too small in Denver? Do they need the higher grossing teams winning to create more revenue...? If not, why?@NBABlackburn Never understood what the Denver Nuggets ever did to the NBA officials to be officiated the way we are. Year in, and year out in for the last 7 or so years.The Denver Nuggets were the 2nd best offense in the league in the last 10 games.
BEFORE they go against these CELTICS.
This is madness.
ROBERT WILLIAMS, MARCUS SMART, TATUM, ROTATIONS ARE PERFECT.
