We Are New York Knicks Fan.@ShaunHudgins @MikeBacsik @nyknicks Lol, I’m well aware. They traded the Dallas pick to charlotte (used to select Kai Jones) last draft for a top-18 protected pick from charlotte.

Knicks then flipped that pick for Reddish, which is why I said “essentially”.

And, you’re weirder for not just taking the L already…@Andreworld88 @MikeBacsik @nyknicks You don't even know your own team's trade details lol. That wasn't the Dallas pick. Not to mention all the other parts of that trade just being ignored in your tweet. Just stop. You're honestly weird for even bumping this convo at all with no real point to be made.@nyknicks @wingstop How about getting someone to quarterback the Knicks offense.@nyknicks @wingstop Stop the tease 😭 play him@ShaunHudgins @MikeBacsik @nyknicks Also, you forgot to mention Cqm Reddish, who was essentially traded for with one of them two Dallas picks NYK received in the KP deal. 🙃🔴 New York Knicks AT TRAILBLAZERS LIVE PLAY BY PLAY &amp; WATCH-ALONG KNICK Follow Party https://t.co/m2DWQP008T@ShaunHudgins @MikeBacsik @nyknicks Someone clearly knows very little about Quentin Grimes to be using his name so flippantly, but we can put a pin on this and check back in again in another 9 months. 🤷🏻‍♂️

It’s their home court@Bwangster12 @TheStrickland @nyknicks @camreddish Cam is more RJ's position (SF) than Grimes. Besides, I want my SG to be a very good shooter, especially the 3.  I do see Cam's high ceiling potential but imo he's not obsessed with becoming great and doesn't have a dog mentality, two of RJ's traits.  Hopefully I'm wrong@owensbfrederick I know! The New York Nets. But to your point, NY already has a team--the Knicks. Moving the Nets to Brooklyn that was a move that I was AGAINST! Still am.

It's back to business as usual and the Knicks are right where they should be. They have budding stars, tons of potential, and may one day attract a superstar. 

And all will be well, my friend@MrMarinKnows @nyknicks Why was Starks speed so much lower than Pat's 😂@nyknicks The only right answer https://t.co/1ny0i5bWlZCan't wait for @Mets baseball. Live and die on the orange and blue @nyknicks@NBA_NewYork Crazy thing is Knicks fans loved him and looked at him as a savior. Meanwhile Dallas fans wanted him traded so many times@DaSportsGuy1 @NBA_NewYork Sims I was told was too raw until the Knicks had only one big available besides him.  He came in and hung in with Nikola Jokic.  But I’m supposed to believe he didn’t practice hard enough and couldn’t be around nba talent even though he looked good facing off against the MVP?@Chancetheman511 @nyknicks @BrooklynNets Lmfaoooo brooo you really had to do this 🤣🤣🤣💀💀💀@StacyPatton89 @NBA_NewYork And! Deuce is in the Knicks future. No rush there. Especially if all he's doing is fine tuning and sharpening his abilities now. Knicks are simply stashing him. No harm in doing that in a season in which we're not built to realistically push for an actual title run@nyknicks Clyde and Willis.
