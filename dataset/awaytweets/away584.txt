Hope all is well.@xLaMarquis309 @ShannonSharpe Oh can’t forget him, it’s not as if Lebron knew he couldn’t lead or win without getting help from the true goat of Miami. The fact anyone has the audacity to say Lebron is the best player in Heat history amazes me@MvpBooker @AlexHoopsYT Tyler Herro is like Miami’s only reliable scorer outside of Jimmy (who’s even somewhat unreliable himself).

Time to #BringTheManaThe Miami Heat are the dark horse imo.

I could not see Ömer stealing playoff rotation minutes. Just seems like a better long term ROI to feed him minutes now.

https://t.co/8rslxzqPeRI’ll be honest, I genuinely don’t know who would win in a hypothetical seven-game series between a healthy Miami Heat team &amp; a healthy Chicago Bulls team.

It would make for one HECK of a series, though.

#NBA75 #HEATCulture@IcyJordan @MiamiHEAT they changed the isolation rule from 10 days to 5 just after he signed so a load of guys came back sooner than expectedMilwaukee Bucks, Phoenix Suns, Golden State Warriors &amp; Miami Heat

Those are the teams I currently have as NBA Championship Quality. 

The Brooklyn Nets Record against those Teams?

0-5

I was having constant nosebleeds because the heat dried out my nasal passages so much. He said, “It’s winter! Dress like it even indoors!” Made perfect since. I think I used to set it at 68 to 70.@GoodmanHoops Juwan Howard took over a team that made the Sweet 16 the previous year and championship game the year prior, after spending six years on the Miami Heat staff. Now look at his squad… Put an asterisk next to his name, Jeff.@Jay_Nice_305 @Anthony_Chiang You got that right my friend she's fan #2 😂😂😂 I will always be #1 I will go up against anyone for my Miami Heat!!!🥰😘.@Wadesburner @MiamiHEAT I feel like Lowry realistically has no shot at all and they're just not even gonna bother. It's slimy af to not support your players but if that's what they're doing it I understand@MiamiHEAT now do Caleb Martin@MiamiHEAT HERRO BALL@MiamiHEAT FREE RIOStill got a few more hours for votes counting double
