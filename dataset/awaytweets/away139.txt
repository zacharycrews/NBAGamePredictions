Tell me what those accomplishments are (except LBJ).  It's an ignorant statement.  I'm not arguing what Cleveland has done, cuz I admit we ain't done shit.  Way to try to change your argument though🙄@jonobgood @TedBear4816 @MikeKilli @KingJames @KyrieIrving @cavs @Lindor12BC @jimbrown @albertbelle @KPJ @kennylofton What has not being able to talk about it done?  You get to walk away and pretend it does not exist, not all of us have that privilege.
