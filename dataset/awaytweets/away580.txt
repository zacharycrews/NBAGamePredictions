Milwaukee is averaging close to 100 PPG in the 2nd game of B2B’s this season. This line is inflated due to recency bias and I will gladly sell high on the Bucks offense tonight.

Milwaukee is on a B2B after an emotional win last night over Brooklyn. I think they'll look to play slower and I expect their defense will have success disrupting the Hornets' offense.

Check injury reports and remember this is only based on analytics. I personally only like the @Suns -7 today. @Celtics seem to be fixed IMO, @Grizzlies are missing key players, @Pistons might be tired, @Bucks and @Hornets should be fun. 🍿 https://t.co/XLRdnhyy9c@itsjwills Madison used to never associate with the @Bucks. I would have to ask the bartenders to put on the @Bucks game@christo49ers @itsjwills Like damn Milwaukee has blown them out twice now 😂 and this time Bucks we’re missing 3 starters, 2 primary bench players, and their head coach. Idk what’s going on with y’all tbhIt's a beautiful Saturday to watch some basketball.

Your Charlotte Hornets take on the Milwaukee Bucks at 7PM. 

Here is EVERYTHING you need to know about the game tonight:

Pick Now Available - https://t.co/40EBDHjBhk@WesMatthewsSZN @Bucks @AlexLasryWI @boogiecousins There's better options then Wes in my opinion &amp; I can understand letting Cousins go if his knee was bothering him but if it wasn't, then releasing Ojeleye or Hood to create a open spot/cap space would've been a better option. I would package Ojeleye &amp; Hood with a 2nd for DrummondHappy Saturday Charlotte!!!

Watch the full conversation: https://t.co/mz1szGlKMZ https://t.co/z6V1AR0ARkThe Brooklyn Nets are on autopilot and coasting. They will be the team to beat in the playoffs imo.

The Milwaukee Bucks are on autopilot and coasting. If the Nets slip up or have injuries, of if Giannis gets hot, the Bucks have a decent chance of defending their title.So when dose the @Bucks pull a trade for Thaddus Young from the Spurs? He just screams a future Milwaukee Buck.Last night's game showed me how much Brooklyn NEEDS Kyrie cause Jim needs to be shipped out at this point. Mans still don't wanna show up against Milwaukee &amp; the m Bucks a well oiled machine right now@WolfDaron_5 @Wiscoboy123 @LSFnJ @Bucks I saw Lee mayfield working too.

to go back and watch that first Heat-Bucks matchup that went down earlier in the year during the 19-20
season in Milwaukee.

Oooops@Bucks Cut Semi. He's HORRIBLE.Mamu has a special place in my heart because he's the first buck I've seen in person (other than games) during my short time in Milwaukee.

Walked right by him on the street as he was walking his precious cutie dog and I said nothing because I'm awkward 🥰Bucks up 20 over Brooklyn after 3. That would be 2 blowouts in their meetings so far. Milwaukee doesn’t even have Jrue, Lopez, Pat C, and Grayson Allen.
