But he has a chance to be 6th man at 2 with oubre playing 3Been on fire in the NBA of late on the @ActionNetworkHQ app. Bets for tonight: 
Miles Bridges over 19.5 points (-116)

Charlotte Hornets and Orlando Magic over 219.5 (-110)

They knew what was coming and didn't want to be chained to him for max dollars.Nice win by the Algorithm last night it is now at 20 wins and 8 losses. Todays NBA pick is the Charlotte Hornets -7 over Orlando in the NBA 🏀. Charlotte should win by 18 and 86 percent of the simulations have Charlotte winning by 8. Good luck 🍀🍀@hornets Good times. 😎@DarreIIe @camutdforever @HornetsPR @hornets Put PJ &amp; Bouknight + whatevr else in a package &amp; trade for a starting center so Bumlee can come off the bench - neither player will get the minutes they desire &amp; this team needs a dominant big man if they want to avoid the play ins bc it’s there for the taking if they want it 😤#NBA @hornets vs @OrlandoMagic

You can put a lot of that swing on the lack of rebounding from the bigs. It’s not all Melo being in or out. Not saying Melo isn’t great or isn’t our franchise guy.

Cause he tries to act just like the Charlotte Hornets announcer😂😂😂. It sounds fakeWhile a good player, wouldn’t categorize Bridges as a shooter.

Shooting 32.1% from 3 this year and 35.0% for his career. 

Also, have to think Hornets would match any offer Bridges receives. Exciting young core in Charlotte. https://t.co/XLBUZtuWSV@BolWrld @hornets he needs a home 👀@hornets @MELOD1P @T_Rozzay3 Would be a contender with a decent big 🥱@barstoolsports @hornets find a way to get him plz@hornets please go after Bol Bol!
