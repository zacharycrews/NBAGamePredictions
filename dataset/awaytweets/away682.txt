Shoutout to the winner ! And the Brooklyn Nets lmao 😂@PhillBrowne @AustralianOpen @KDTrey5 @BrooklynNets @Bengals Bloody 49ers. First saw NFL as a kid, SuperBowl XVI, where the 49ers just beat the Bengals. I immediately liked the bengals (“what’s a “49er”?) so made them my team. Then again in their 2nd SuperBowl, the bloody 49ers just pipped my Bengals. Never won one, lost 2, to your lot. 😡How the @BrooklynNets fans feel about @KyrieIrving not committing to the team? What does that say to the guys giving up PT at home but sacrificing EVERYTHING 100% for the team? How you gonna feel when the #Nets lose a game 7 at home? Should they try &amp; NOT secure home court? 🤔 https://t.co/MjVf66Mm3lSan Antonio Spurs vs Brooklyn Nets Live Stream - NBA 2022

Warriors biggest issues are turnovers and ft%, Draymond is second with most turnovers and has the third worse ft% with 59.7, so how does his help all of a sudden turns the team around?#Spoiler

Date : Friday, Jan. 21 - Time : 8:30 PMThe Nets reversed course about 35 games into the season. Under the new agreement, Irving is a part-time player who can participate in most road games but is barred from playing at home in Brooklyn or in away games vs the Knicks in Madison Square Garden due to NYC’s mandate.A high-profile example is Brooklyn Nets basketball player Kyrie Irving, who was told in October that he wouldn’t be able to practice or play for the team until he met New York’s COVID-19 vaccine requirement.As camisas mais vendidas durante a 1ª metade da temporada da NBA por equipe:

I expect Brooklyn to release him tho.@BrooklynNets @DukeMBB @KyrieIrving He would thrive way more if he would get his shots! Now Hardin will be gone when the seasons over. I’m sure Durant will probably jet also. So why doesn’t Kyrie give his team a shot to win it all?
