MJ is 6-0 meaning he never lost once he won. The man could have been 8-0 if not for retiring to play baseball. Imagine that 8-0 wish he had stayed and got his 8 or 9th chip@M_S_W6 @aFrozenRhino @flee_hwk17 @KendrickPerkins @cavs @KingJames @Money23Green @warriors @NBA MJ won his first title before Bron won his and Bron had to create a even greater team than MJ had to do it. He got 2 outta 4 with a Prime Dwade Bosh and a sniper in Ray Allen. MJ won 6 straight Bron went 2-2 then lost again then eventually won another then lost more then won.The first time @RazorbackMBB played in San Fran was January 2nd, 1948 when #Arkansas beat the San Francisco Dons 74-58 in the Cow Palace, the eventual home of the San Francisco Warriors. UA will play in the @warriors' newest arena Thursday.

Grateful for everything they do in the community. @DubsCommunity https://t.co/u0CwJ9DkAL@eyeslow19 @DaltonJ_Johnson @LockedOnDubs The wear and tear of defending bigs could be affecting his shooting or, what’s more likely is that his shooting struggles are affecting his confidence resulting in poor free throw shooting.

I personally recommended the @warriors bring in Hall of Famer @Rick24Barry to coach him.@warriors @SociosUSA the 37-pt quarter is hard to beat in terms of efficiency. He did not miss a shot in that quarter, 13/13 FG, 9/9 from 3, 2/2 FT.@warriors GAME DAY!! We are expecting a win because we know what this team is capable of. Keep the fast pace, and rebounds at both ends. You can use the backboard on layups. Points count the same.@jwc292 @koestreicher34 Nah they’ll make the playoffs. Sadly though I see it being another Divisional round exit. But it’ll be close and we’ll be proud.

Houston Rockets@veefriends That is SO F**KING DOPE!! I love basketball so to be able to sit courtside with one of my favorite people would be amazing!! However, we’d have to be at a @warriors game because I don’t route for anyone but my home town fellas!! 🏀@warriors @Verizon Pls play Juan instead of chioza for size defense attitude &amp; aggression. Juan isn’t scared because he isn’t a young dude.Grown men vs young men have the maturity will impose themselves. Juan plays great against good teams b cuz he just isn’t scared. kerr hasn’t played him enough
