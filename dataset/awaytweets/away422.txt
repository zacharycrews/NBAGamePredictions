Denver Nuggets - Minnesota Timberwolves

Nikola Jokic O12.5 Rebounds @ 1.75 ($100)

Jokic averaging 14.3 rebounds in December, and Minnesota is the #1 worst rebounding team in the league. I also like his match-up w/ Towns.

My TS username: StathisVog"On June 25th, 2009 the Minnesota Timberwolves had the 5th and 6th pick in the draft.  They chose Ricky Rubio and Jonny Flynn.  Stephen Curry went 7th.  I told David Kahn on this show multiple times he should draft Steph."  - @dpshow 
@SIChrisMannix@ChrisLongKSTP One of those moments where I remember where I was when David Stern said, ‚ÄúWith the 6th pick the Minnesota Timberwolves select‚Ä¶Jonny Flynn‚Äù‚Ä¶Curry had literally fallen into their lap and they not only take Rubio but Jonny Flynn instead‚Ä¶Reminder that the Minnesota Timberwolves used picks 5 and 6 to draft TWO point guards IN A ROW, the same position Steph Curry plays, immediately before Golden State took Steph Curry with the 7th pick https://t.co/WiAF563Jda https://t.co/xOvjb36XzZFormer Minnesota Timberwolves exec took three point guards not named Steph Curry in the 1st round of the 2009 draft, not that it‚Äôs a sore spot or anything https://t.co/2Ts3ZWKuBE@CNBC "former vice president of the NBA‚Äôs Minnesota Timberwolves"

Pick #1 NBA/ Indiana Pacers -2 

Pick #2 NBA/ Minnesota Timberwolves Vs Denver Nuggets over 224

Pick # 3 NBA/ Memphis Grizzlies -2.5

#PickDawgzCapperContestThe Washington Wizards could've drafted @StephenCurry30 with the #5 pick but instead traded it (and cash!!!) to the Minnesota Timberwolves for Mike Miller and Randy Foye. 

Of course the Timberwolves fucked up too by using the #5 and #6 picks to draft Ricky Rubio and Jonny Flynn. https://t.co/bbXwOgQN0tJust a friendly reminder the Minnesota Timberwolves passed up on Steph Curry TWICE... https://t.co/nPndUo8ASnConsensus Line Move:
