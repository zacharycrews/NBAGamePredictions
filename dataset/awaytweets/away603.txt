Just please nothing with the Phoenix Suns bro 😂😂😂As much as I love Steve Nash, Charles Barkley is THE reason I became a Phoenix Suns fan. 

Jordan was great. 

Kobe was great. 

LeBron is great. 

But there will NEVER be another Barkley. He knew who he was from a young age and he OWNED it. 

Rodman had a similar vibe as well.@joshgad @MiamiDolphins As a @Suns fan who has suffered through Sarver, I feel your pain.
