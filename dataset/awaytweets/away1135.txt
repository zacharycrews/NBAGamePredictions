She really likes porter Jr. because he went to Missouri lol@BleacherReport If the Denver Nuggets get back Jamal Murray and Michael Porter Junior it’s a wrap for golden state. They can beat them without those guys because Jokic is ballin. Golden State is overrated and even with Steph Curry fully healthy it’s still not gonna be enough. One and done.NBA Consensus (So Far):

at 6-6 and 185, Beauchamp is a skilled swingman who can rack up steals and blocks but also score the basketball, and he will be a great fit with the Nuggets roster.
