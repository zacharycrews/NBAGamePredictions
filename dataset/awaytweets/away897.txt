He got injured by Jalen Rose in game 2. And he won the title. LeBron was 8 years in and choked. Wade is a star but not in the running for GOAT.

Get your tickets here https://t.co/i1DJKxXQlI https://t.co/mdiNBB654lThe Dallas Mavericks have a game tomorrow. https://t.co/nJPLXcKFWEDallas Mavericks: Starting with Utah, Mavs ready for stretch run of season https://t.co/SSzvo8L9N2This is the first mens game I’ve seen in 2 years, since I figured out I was getting brainwashed. I only watch Dallas Mavericks game, and I’ve seen as many woman play basketball as I’m allowed. But, I can’t miss a chance for  Bill to say “THROW IT DOWN” https://t.co/Wcf187kSOO@DwainPrice @dallasmavs Looking good there, Dwain!Starting with Friday's pivotal game in Utah, the @dallasmavs have 23 games remaining in the regular season. Three of those games are against the Jazz, and two are against the Warriors. But the Mavs and Kings have the fewest number of back-to-backs -- two.
