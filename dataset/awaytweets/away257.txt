#MagicTogether https://t.co/0kOV2iaiB4I think they take the Bucks to the wire again tonight. Milwaukee is 9-30 ATS in its last 39 games following three or more consecutive home wins.  Orlando is 4-1 ATS in its last five games as road underdogs.  The Bucks are 0-7 ATS in their last seven home games.  Bet the Magic.Monday's Free Pick: Orlando Magic +12.5

I like the spot for the Orlando Magic tonight.  They will be out for revenge from a 108-117 loss at Milwaukee as identical 12.5-point dogs on Saturday.  Now they get to face the Bucks in Milwaukee again just two days later here Monday.🏀🏀NBA Games!

➡️ The Cleveland Cavaliers will host the Brooklyn Nets at the Rocket Mortgage FieldHouse tonight.

➡️ The Orlando Magic will play the Milwaukee Bucks for the second time in three nights.

Shocking https://t.co/CZNsKOTP5K@PlayoffHuskies @WixersWoah That’s a goal the Orlando Magic should be proud of not the Boston Celtics…. after a couple of those it starts being a failure to make the next jump if you just constantly bow out in the conference finals..Randle for Mo Wagner @OrlandoMagic@Johnny_Domenico I've gained an all new level of respect for Orlando Magic fans@egregirls My most recent entry into subspace was in a particularly bumpy ride on a roller coaster (seven dwarves minecart in magic kingdom in orlando fl)OBI FOR THREEEEEEEEE (first make against not the Orlando Magic)@WFLANiko @Lakers @NSBonsu_ Attended an @Lakers game 3 yrs ago in LA - so cool and will see them 2022 against @OrlandoMagic

I wasn’t going to watch them until they won a few games because the Orlando Magic are playing harder than them now. It’s a shame.
