Added the Spurs, D. Murray looked pretty good before the AllStar break and during the Allstar game. I think he gets his boys ready for tonight and carry his play into tonight. Let’s go 2-0 🙏🏽 https://t.co/bmt1bMvNsgHere is why I love the spurs:

San Antonio has a worse losing % then the Wiz, yet they are still favored...on the road. 

Also, when you match talent to talent, Spurs are collectively better. Kuzma? Neto? KCP?  Come on.

https://t.co/HSlLcRaPU9@RealSkipBayless Pop unlocked his play making abilities.  He made DeMar a smarter basketball player. He also has a lot more help on the Bulls then he did on the Spurs. He was playing at an All Star level in San Antonio but no-one cared. It harder to win in the West then the East.@RealSkipBayless its was the san antonio coach that unlocked this talent.  derozan was dealing with his sick father. hard to play with alot on his mind. spurs fans appreciate.@RealSkipBayless Because in the absence of LaMarcus Aldridge, San Antonio wasn't able to surround him with the kind of ball handling and shooting that Chicago has in spades, and had to give a lot of attention to developing the younger guys. Having said that, DeMar was really good for the Spurs.@ziyanm_ demar derozan is a better chicago bull than demar derozan ever was a San Antonio spur or Toronto raptorSan Antonio Spurs: Pelicans shootaround update: Second half opens on home floor of NBA’s best team https://t.co/qb6ZVnbqRI“San Antonio coach”, you know Pops  name.

I’m just saying 🤷🏻‍♂️@lilnormy26 @LegionHoops Portland was a thorn to the side for San Antonio from like 2008 to 2016. They always played tough against the Spurs, except that 1 year they met in the postseason@AustinEatman24 i don’t think he had to do with spurs coaching i think he learned a lot in san antonio and chicago is just the perfect fit for him he’s surrounded by a lot of talent and i think that’s taken a lot of pressure off himI got my Spurs on, San Antonio@NBA2K_MyTEAM WTF is Cinny Powell?

At least 3 times I was told the map should be changed to include a team where there already is one. Also had a guy tell me to look at population sized, and he compares the city I want to add a team to with@BabyYogurt_ @BBallBecka @Embiid_prodzz Houston Rockets
San Antonio Spurs
Dallas Mavericks

Yeah they could probably do 3 teams like they have for the last several decades.@Embiid_prodzz Santa Fe - Lions?

Everyone said it was over for him when he was traded to San Antonio but now he’s back &amp; playing better ball than he did in Toronto. Top 3 MVP candidate for me. #Spurs #Bulls #Raptors@BuckieLakers @KendrickPerkins Spurs didn't resign him because they were going young and wanted DeRozan to have a chance at a playoff run. They care about their players. DeRozan became a better player while in San Antonio.
