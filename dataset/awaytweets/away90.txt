"When the floor gets congested for us, and we don't take shots, we turn the ball over. So the best way to not turn it over is to shoot it when you're open."Quin Snyder on the @utahjazz 20 turnovers last night against the Bulls.

"Last night was a good example of the type of turnovers that we really can't have because they didn't come from trying to make an extra pass. 

I wasn't happy with our efficiency."

#TheGamePlan@HowardKriswandi @utahjazz @PodiumHQ @mconley11 Jazz need a durable point guard. Juggling lineups all the time is no good. Joe, Butler &amp; Trent were big negatives in Conley's replacement. The whole team was forcing it &amp; 20 turnovers. Mike wanted none of Lonzo Ball. Much less LaVine or DeRozan.@TBOTBPodcast @BrooklynNetsAus @chicagobulls @utahjazz But ya‚Äôll have fun in the weaker conference@TBOTBPodcast @BrooklynNetsAus @chicagobulls @utahjazz Joker had 24 points in 15m before he went off injured.
