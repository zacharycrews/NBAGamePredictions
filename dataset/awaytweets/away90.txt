"When the floor gets congested for us, and we don't take shots, we turn the ball over. So the best way to not turn it over is to shoot it when you're open."Quin Snyder on the @utahjazz 20 turnovers last night against the Bulls.

"Last night was a good example of the type of turnovers that we really can't have because they didn't come from trying to make an extra pass. 

I wasn't happy with our efficiency."

If Jaz said that, the room would’ve erupted. The culture is dying from BIASES and y’all helping it. God bless you, @YoungGattas https://t.co/PImmL1GV33"Butler will sit out against the Jazz.

Utah Jazz @ Milwaukee Bucks tonight at 7pm ET on NBA TV. https://t.co/hxvuKckOG2The Bulls played their most complete game of the young season Saturday night, toppling the NBA's last unbeaten team in the Utah Jazz. 

https://t.co/znYwgXKkgF https://t.co/21T9gfN3bS@utahjazz Jazz lost the last championship by playing without guts in the decisions. The team is wonderful, but without lethality. Us big games don't be good kids, be bad guys.
 ~Translation~@chicagobulls 5-1!

1 basket away from being 6-0! 

@DeMar_DeRozan and @ZachLaVine combined for 58 (32 and 26 respectively) last night against the then unbeaten @utahjazz !

Unfortunately there’s a small (but loud) portion of Jazz Nation that are younger and never watched Harpring play. So to them, he was just some  guy who played for the Jazz at some point.

#TheGamePlan@HowardKriswandi @utahjazz @PodiumHQ @mconley11 Jazz need a durable point guard. Juggling lineups all the time is no good. Joe, Butler &amp; Trent were big negatives in Conley's replacement. The whole team was forcing it &amp; 20 turnovers. Mike wanted none of Lonzo Ball.

Royce doesn't do it all. He is a liability on offense. If he was Rodman caliber on defense then fine...but he isn't close to that level.@utahjazz @PodiumHQ Inexcusable loss!@JoshRWilliams4 @utahjazz DeRozan was a big positive today. Royce can't do it all. Rudy, Joe &amp; Bogy are slow. Chicago pushed the ball all night. It worked.@JazzCoach22 @BuckleUpBoler @utahjazz No clue. I would say no. Perhaps he wanted to leave. Don't know. Some hated him .  I liked him.@JoshRWilliams4 @BuckleUpBoler @utahjazz Does Harpring want too much money? We miss him.@alfredb15 @utahjazz Rotating point guards? Ingles, Butler and Forrest all had big negatives. So did Rudy.@Returnpuff @TheKurtoWEBBY @utahjazz He’s a bit devious so I doubt it 🤭@utahjazz I guess we got too "tired" after playing in Houston,
How else we can explain the sloppiness ??☹️🙄🙄@BuckleUpBoler @utahjazz Not the same without KK and Harpring@utahjazz I like guys that work in the off season and improve their game...Royce has been the same player for 3 years now....#NBA BASKETBALL 🏀

In all seriousness, UT is a great place for hiking, skiing, and seeing the Utah Jazz. And when I was little we got the best salt water taffy in Salt Lake City. ☺️The @utahjazz offense floundered without Mike Conley in their first loss of the season. 

Plus, Jared Butler's early struggles, and how Rudy Gay will help this roster.

Yes, the Utah Jazz can't make a shot. I never said the refs are the sole reason for a loss.Utah Jazz with Rudy Gobert 104.7 DRTG (-8.1 rDRTG) Top 10 Ever

Utah Jazz without Rudy Gobert 115.5 DRTG (+2.7 rDRTG) Bottom 5 in the league 

Safe to say Gobert is criminally underrated now https://t.co/VyWo6xTFCRUtah Jazz is really a shitty 😒Have a BIG man like rudy gobert and don't use him pff 💔
