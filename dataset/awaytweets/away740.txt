OG Anunoby feels like a safe pick.A lot of good trends to follow for the #NBA tonight, but here is my favorite:

Heat-Raptors Over 209.5

The spot is perfect for a couple of top 5 over teams. Miami is 6-1 to the over on the 2nd leg of a B2B. Toronto is 9-2 to the over with a rest advantage! GIVE ME POINTS! https://t.co/HBxrXI4Z4P🏀NBA PLAY🏀

Heat -3.5

-Miami has covered 4 of their last 5 at home
- This line has dropped 2 points with money coming in on Toronto.
- I like this play even more if VanVleet is out. The Raptors are 1-4 in games without him this season.

https://t.co/BngUUEUjShYou know what Goran Dragic and Kyle Lowry have in common? 

Both prefer to live in Miami &gt; Toronto.

You can't blame them, they're following in the footsteps of the greatest Raptor of all time, Chris Bosh.The Miami Heat look to end their home back-to-back with a win over the Toronto Raptors.

It's -16 in Toronto right now@JLew1050 what are the affects of the @Raptors buying our Dragic on their salary cap?  In essence, would buying him out provide some space to add a piece?  He isn’t going to play for Raps this year and no team will trade for him, knowing he may be bought out. #RaptorsThe DJ Chocolate Milk tweet was trolling the anti-vaxxers.

I repeat, the DJ Chocolate Milk tweet was trolling the anti-vaxxers.

It was not someone trying to pass off the Toronto Raptors parade as Ottawa.@MJama22 As a true professional, Goran hasn’t deserved such a treatment from Raptors.

But Toronto couldn't find a third party to make the deal.@TO_Resident You know it's fake cuz it's not even Ottawa. That's the Raptors' parade in Toronto. Oh look! There's the CN Tower!

[via r/torontoraptors Jan 29, 2018 #Raptors]@mikaeladraws I think I’m prepared to agree with that. I’ve got a soft spot for some of the late 90s Toronto Raptors stuff but I’m not sure how good it is lol@TheNBACentral @eric_torrente @Raptors is there any way of trading him?Toronto Raptors are improving but they've only just scratched the surface https://t.co/7L2toJk52r https://t.co/6sInVwbdiL@WalderSports @Raptors better fine his ass https://t.co/DEYgj6B32qToronto Raptors Fathers Day Chain by SalemDianaDesigns via @Etsy https://t.co/UBBRrkEKMkWow!

Nobody wants Dragic in Toronto! He is NOT a team player, all about "me". The Raptors don't need his like, and they're better without him.@sarahrimmington @KingDami5299 @TheNBACentral @eric_torrente @Raptors They didnt trade him without letting him know, and they gave him a good contract too. Which got him paid. Not all trades leave scorched earth."Should we try to trade for E'twaun Moore? 😍 😍 😍"

Estimates of crowd size given by event organizers are often off by an order of magnitude.

(I love the Toronto Raptors but 2M people definitely did not show up for the victory parade in 2019, for example)@connor09120149 He used to play for the Heat. Didn’t want to go to the Raptors because they aren’t winning anything anytime soon and I’m sure like the rest of us if he had the choice of living in Toronto or Miami he would choose Miami lol.Willie Green on the tough loss in Toronto | Pelicans at Raptors 1-9-22

#LEGENDoftheMiamiHEAT #NBA75We have Gentleman Swept The Toronto Raptors to Move Onto the 2nd Round.@KingDami5299 @TheNBACentral @eric_torrente @Raptors He is not allowed to be traded back to the Heat this season, or to sign there if he gets bought out. Ain't happening unless it's next off-season. Also he should have the pride. The Heat traded him, as filler, no less.@Raptors @vivekmjacob @TangerineHoops This man understand that the refs will always be against us. So go out there and be as grimy as possible. Make every foul account and make sure that they can't get an and1. Hard fouls only. Make em work. They cannot beat us so they use rough and dirty tactics. We do the same@DJChocolateMLK Yeah - that's a doctored photo of the Raptors parade in Toronto in the summer after they won the NBA season. Ottawa is deep in snow with -25C to -35C this past week.

They have the same birth signs.@MrCorder0_SC @Raptors Goran Dragic@Raptors @Bell This one is so emotional. Jimmy we are very lucky to have you here.@orisawesome @Raptors Who is that?@DJChocolateMLK Amazing how it looks alot more like the Raptors celebration parade....in the summer.......in TorontoThere is no way the Miami Heat would ever give him up, but Bam Adebayo would be the perfect centre for the Toronto RaptorsGoran Dragic is a member of the Miami Heat more than the Toronto Raptors right now.@completequester Raptors championship parade in Toronto.@Raptors @Bell What a wonderful story!!

Any chance the book signing tour stops in Toronto?@davetaylor_AB @DJChocolateMLK Funny how Ottawa is looking more and more like Toronto and the trucks look like buses with the Toronto Raptors on them. But I’m looking at it from Alberta so maybe I’m missing something.
