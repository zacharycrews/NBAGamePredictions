üìª @RipCityRadio620 https://t.co/8xuW3VHqBDFirst player up today is Dame Lillard vs the utah Jazz. 

Dame Dollas loves posting career games against the jazz. He has 2 50 balls, 1 40 piece, 5 35+ games, and 4 30+ games. A injury ridden trail blazers team vs utah without Dmitch with dame getting hot gimme gimme https://t.co/D84wQXsjiiKarl Malone scored 36,928 points but the world only cares that he scored with a 13 year old girl #nba #CancelCulture #utahjazz@spidadmitchell makes the impossible, possible through PURE grit and determination along with raw talent #TakeNote @utahjazz @adidas https://t.co/AmNM9lhTLhThe utah jazz from 2007-2010 had a little run there those were some really good jazz teams@domainrecap @MartinEden____ @NFLonCBS ...and since evidently you know, tell us how Michael Jordan's career would've gone if he'd been drafted by the Utah Jazz? Still 6 rings? And while you're at it if Joe Montana had been selected by the Detroit Lions? Clown post bro...@utahjazz @Qualtrics 33 points at 38% = 125 shot attempts. There is an advantage to that and that is the other players know to crash the boards for the rebounds. In other thoughts the backboard can be the 6th man.DasHaus made a bet!
