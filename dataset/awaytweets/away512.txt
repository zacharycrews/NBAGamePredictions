#DamianLillard | #NBAAllStar https://t.co/CpESnD2Pk5#ImpossibleIsNothing and the proof is that @spidamitchell is so good he almost makes it tolerable to watch @utahjazz 😝50 fg attempts he had the ultimate green light so imo that was the 3rd most impressive thing that night. But what was more impressive than the 60 was the comeback AND the elimination of Utah jazz from the playoffs… all because of Mr.Bean 💯 https://t.co/9LOzOKeHSjMiami head coach Erik Spoelstra and Utah Jazz guard Jordan Clarkson appealed to basketball fans to extend their help to the survivors of typhoon #OdettePH.
