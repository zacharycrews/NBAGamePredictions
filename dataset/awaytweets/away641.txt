@SunDevilHoops @Suns x The Curtain of Distraction https://t.co/cb9cvJxVMTi always remember when deandre ayton was drafted to the suns and he was like “yeah it’s an hour drive from tucson to phoenix and everyone was like HOW FAST DO U DRIVE SIRNBA Basketball Game Betting Picks Simulator: 1/16/2022 1:00 PM ET - Phoenix Suns vs. Detroit Pistons - YOU CAN RUN THE GAME SIMULATION FOR FREE HERE: https://t.co/Aipvxtcyqq #nba #sportsbetting #freepicks #cappertekTil this day I'm still in shock that the Phoenix Suns couldn't win their NBA championship last year, you beat LeBron you got to win everything, they were even more lucky that Kawhi got injured or else Clippers winning that series

AND up 2-0 in the finals then losing 4 straight??@suns x #afterschoolspecial has arrived!!! Weeee!!! https://t.co/wiHmOMiCln@NekiasNBA as the proud owner of a Davon Reed Suns game-worn warmup shirt, I had no recollection of this game but wow this was a brutal lineup for Phoenix https://t.co/nzANimZ8pT@that1mexicano @Jumpshot8 @Suns Lol talk 2 me later https://t.co/CAIQSOJJ6y@that1mexicano @Jumpshot8 @Suns Fine by me lol such a bad excuse 😂phoenix suns native 🔒 https://t.co/lWrB0z62ls@Suns More valley booker jerseys@that1mexicano @Jumpshot8 @Suns Klays back on his 3rd game off 2 injury’s lmaooo😂playin only 20 mins  when he gets back to normal minutes and draymond come back good luck n last time I checked we blew suns out once n beat them wit a depleted team so I’m not worried bout suns lol@Jumpshot8 @Suns The playoffs will settle these disputes but these standing are the Facts, Jack!!This is strictly a Yom, Love Live, and Phoenix Suns account from today on https://t.co/0nTpn0iOzf@favoritewcw1 @Jumpshot8 @Suns Tell that bull to a team like the Lakers, who have played against more under 500. teams (24)than anyone but are only 500. &amp; sinking!!@TedPennington8 @Suns Cause you from scottsdale 🤦🏾‍♂️@Jumpshot8 @neoslashnet @Suns Naw...I will leave that for you senior citizens...😂😂😂2/ Phoenix meaning symbolism in almost every culture around the world!

In Greece, it is actually a global symbol of rebirth.

In Egypt, phoenix represents their sun God Ra and the city of Heliopolis.@jonhugghost @GBFan4Life1217 @yashgurango123 @SportsCenter Ooooh ok. Yeah Chili's still has better queso dip than the Phoenix Suns arena. Guess I gotta get rid of my Barbosa poster. https://t.co/TqDz2Slvr4@that1mexicano @Jumpshot8 @Suns Ight so u have excuses so I guees I can too then 😂😂😂 we ain’t worried bout wiseman Lmaoo we waiting for draymond to come back@Blktone2303 *gets a note slid to him*

And yes! It has been pointed out that the Bills have scored on every. Single. Drive.  Haven't seen this much holes in a defense since the Phoenix Suns Run N' Gun.  Holy mother, send a prayer up for the Pats, they are gonna need that and then some.@johnnyoplaya64 @neoslashnet @Suns You wish u were in this nursing home. 🙂@nickthreeHEAT @Jumpshot8 @Suns I was very clear this was not an excuse. But overzealous fans tend to ignore reality and crown themselves “a better team” without understanding the facts. 

If Miami would have lost, missing players would have been the excuse. 

15 losses in the weak East is not “better.”@that1mexicano @Jumpshot8 @Suns What happen when the suns places Celtics? Same shit 😂 lmao good try doe@Jumpshot8 @neoslashnet @Suns Ok dum dum...I think it's movie night at the nursing home...run along now...🤣🤣🤣Pro basketball @nba @suns 🌎🏀🎤 @dreamville @espn @power983 @ Footprint Center https://t.co/BitZK8RX13@TownBiz96 @Jumpshot8 @Suns It never ceases to amaze me how "smart" people think they are on the internet. You are clearly nothing but a fanboy and you keep talking to me about basketball IQ, lmao. Omg, ur killing me. 🤣🤣🤣 just stop already, it's too much! 🤣🤣🤣@KingsFa59136947 @InTheLabBrand davon reed, phoenix suns legend@TownBiz96 @Jumpshot8 @Suns You're not very old, are you? That's not a thing kids say... in fact, if anything, it kind of dates me. But, whatever... 🙄🙄🙄@TownBiz96 @Jumpshot8 @Suns You really ARE a bandwagon Warrior, lolz.@TownBiz96 @Jumpshot8 @Suns Uh huh... 🙄🤣@TownBiz96 @Jumpshot8 @Suns You too, lol.@TownBiz96 @Jumpshot8 @Suns And in fairness, KD was a pretty big part of that core. Gaping hole there now. Just sayin...@TownBiz96 @Jumpshot8 @Suns Then again, maybe I take back my apology, lol. Smacked in 5, huh? Well, I guess we'll see. Time will tell. See you in the playoffs...@TownBiz96 @Jumpshot8 @Suns But, then again, I probably shouldn't be telling a fan what's wrong with his team. That shit pisses me off, so I appologize, lol. Reality is, GS is absolutely a contender, of course they are. I just don't know about the whole "best" team thing. But either way best of luck to you.@TownBiz96 @Jumpshot8 @Suns GS fans gonna see exactly what I mean, come playoff time. I really hope Wiseman can fill that void for you, but it probably won't be enough.@johnnyoplaya64 @neoslashnet @Suns 9th or below is last to me@TownBiz96 @Jumpshot8 @Suns In fairness, I already offered my "retort," lol. Nothing else to say, honestly. But you'll see for yourself soon enough. Take it from a Suns fan who watched his team get smacked by the Bucks last year. GS ain't who I'm worried about, lol. But, we largely fixed that problem.@ReMenkau @AzSvor @gr73159199 @eriko_esteban @JVasJr32 @Abdiaziz1h @Jumpshot8 @Suns Nah you’re right though. Probably just more wishful thinking on my end@SunsJAM @Suns Ditch everything except these and The Valley jersey https://t.co/M90OZeSfv0@Jumpshot8 @neoslashnet @Suns We weren't in last place last year stoopy...@ReMenkau @Jumpshot8 @Suns Ah the ol bandwagon warrior tweet, would make sense if I also didn’t cheer for raiders and the A’s but hey when you know ur team gonna get smacked I guess that’s the only retort u have. Enjoy the regular season buddy, y’all just the new rockets and we all know how that ended 😉Catch On Impact @ The Detroit Pistons vs The Phoenix Suns NBA Game Live

Most fans are hoping Wiseman can fix that, but if he can’t then what do we do? I think the warriors are still contenders, but only time will tell@LeviticusSports @AzSvor @gr73159199 @eriko_esteban @JVasJr32 @Abdiaziz1h @Jumpshot8 @Suns But thats a HUGE difference, lol. But more importantly, the exact difference he was talking about, hence his comment about dealing with big teams. Take it from a Suns fan watching them go down to the Bucks last year. It's gonna hurt come playoff time...@favoritewcw1 @Jumpshot8 @Suns Everyone always says stop with the excuses when the Suns lose, but when they win, there is no shortage of excuses then. Whatever, man. I guess we'll see come April. But hey, honestly I hope everyone continues disregarding and underestimating the Suns. Will never see them coming.Can you imagine the @Suns not having a head coach when free agency opened? That’s exactly where @PhoenixMercury are right now. Did they even have a plan when they decided not to bring back @SBrondello cause right now they are looking inept.@ReMenkau @AzSvor @gr73159199 @eriko_esteban @JVasJr32 @Abdiaziz1h @Jumpshot8 @Suns Except it’s not different. The only difference is the center position, they’re deeper now than they’ve been@johnnyoplaya64 @neoslashnet @Suns Last place teams last two years not invited to this conversation.@NbaGenius548 @NBA @Suns Ok, season isn’t over. Westbrook balling idc what anyone say@ReMenkau @Jumpshot8 @Suns Yea when they played the good teams most of the star players were out Lmaoo watch when playoffs hit they ain’t gon be prepared@neoslashnet @Jumpshot8 @Suns They threw a parade for being the November champs, now they want to be the kings of January. Lol.@TownBiz96 @Jumpshot8 @Suns Yeah, right, I'm the one with the low basketball IQ, not the GS fanboi, lol. I'm laughing harder than Stanley right now, but still not nearly as hard as I will be after GS gets knocked out in late April, early May, lol. I'm saving this tweet, too, lmao!3 Trade Deadline Targets for the Phoenix Suns to Pursue

https://t.co/DHp7kuahxg@ReMenkau @Jumpshot8 @Suns Oh man, this just goes to ur basketball iq or lack thereof. It’s all good man I will definitely save this tweet https://t.co/C6HWPMrUtg@Jumpshot8 @Suns You shouldn't have to say it, someone should remind ESPN.  I guess the Suns aren't bulliten material@_roejogan @Jumpshot8 @Suns Cause they ain't us? 😜🤣🤣🤣@Suns Go Suns!!@allendaysr @Jumpshot8 @Suns I'll be holding my breath waiting, lmao.@favoritewcw1 @Jumpshot8 @Suns Are you talking about the Suns? This whole strength of schedule argument hasn't applied since about mid November now, you realize that, don't you? If you look at the actual number, the Suns have the best overall record against teams above .500 now. Strength of schedule. Lol.While people debate #DevinBooker and dinosaurs, the Phoenix Suns are currently the best team in the NBA at 32-9. #NBAAllStar https://t.co/sVsH4Jhp1R@TownBiz96 @Jumpshot8 @Suns And the team is probably worse for it. Nobody close to it can see it, but literally everyone else does. Sorry, but GS, is gonna have a great season, then lose out in the first or second round of the playoffs. Mark my words. Calling it now.A HOUSE DIVIDED 
Connecticut Sun / Phoenix Mercury https://t.co/qDr8Vf8wrX@LeviticusSports @AzSvor @gr73159199 @eriko_esteban @JVasJr32 @Abdiaziz1h @Jumpshot8 @Suns GS is a very different team now, then in those years. I think that was the point of his comment.@Abdiaziz1h @Jumpshot8 @Suns Umm, they already did, so "can't," is just nonsense. Clearly they can. I tell ya, all this hype for Golden State is just getting plain old.@neoslashnet @Jumpshot8 @Suns Only thing that's "small time," is that ugly ass mug of yours. Good lord! Lmfao! 🤣🤣🤣@Jumpshot8 @Suns Thanks for setting the record straight!👍🏼@NbaGenius548 @NBA @Suns That’s the Suns highlights, getting to the playoffs haha well be there no worries we’re getting ad back@AZSpyder @Jumpshot8 @Suns Missing players is probably not a great excuse for a loss to a team missing 2 all stars@ThomasHoops87 @WheresTheBall97 @Jumpshot8 @Suns absolutely losing his shit bc of a picture of the standings, as we all knew they would@Jumpshot8 @Suns Lmao. This kind of talk reminds us why The Suns are small time. Y’all haven’t won anything , season isn’t close to being over and you are tweeting this? I guess you just want engagement on your tweets. Congrats on the regular season chip up til this point. LOL.@Jumpshot8 @Suns Soon as the Warriors jump over them next week. You are going to freeze your comment section.@DICKS looking for an update on the @Suns city edition jersey pre order from November? Was supposed to ship by 1/10 but order hasn't budged since 11/15. Just sports pre-orders are already shipping.@nickthreeHEAT @Jumpshot8 @Suns The Suns played with three players that just got off COVID protocols. They weren’t even in game shape yet. 

They were also missing three players. 

No excuses but don’t be surprised at a different result next time.Raps (&amp; maybe Pascal) need Bobby Portis or someone of his ilk to start every game CHIRPING b/c that was the moment the game changed for @Raptors. 
Crazy the Raps played Phoenix Suns to final shot &amp; will beat Bucks 3-0 on season but STILL can't beat Dwane Casey er.. the Pistons.Arguably, the Phoenix Suns biggest need come trade deadline is a backup primary ball handling Point Guard. With Elfrid Payton &amp; Abdel Nader on the trade block/in the trade rumor mill, rumors now surface on the Phoenix Suns trading for Cory Joseph of the Detroit Pistons. @Gambo987@BickJones @RatedKG_22 Yea this Phoenix Sun fan been blowing me up cause Herbert been at home like him@Jumpshot8 @Suns This is equivalent to the run that the franchise had from 89 to 93…but this team is closer to winning a title; giving credit where credit is due from a die hard Los Angeles native Laker fan@dom_tesoriero Adding these two certainly ups the @Suns chances.  Miracle happens here if Suns land them.@JoshCas28593647 @DuaneRankin @MikeAScotto @Suns Saric, sticks, and Nader and maybe a 1st round pick for sabonis and Craig@brawadis As much as you love the Phoenix Suns ! I have to say hi Brian 👋 🤣@AzSvor @gr73159199 @eriko_esteban @JVasJr32 @Abdiaziz1h @Jumpshot8 @Suns Considering he’s been pretty good defensively so far and he’s not fully back, I believe he’ll be an above average defender again. Will he be at the level he once was? Probably not@Jumpshot8 @Suns And two players were in the Olympics!@LeviticusSports @gr73159199 @eriko_esteban @JVasJr32 @Abdiaziz1h @Jumpshot8 @Suns Dude is 32 and hasn’t played in over 2 years. He’s had 2 injuries that significantly alter careers. You sure about that?@Jumpshot8 @Suns Nice, buts its the playoffs that count. I really like the Suns tbh, but they need to show me that last year wasn't a fluke because of injuries and they don't have much playoff experience compared to teams like the Bucks, Warriors, Lakers etc.@gr73159199 @AzSvor @eriko_esteban @JVasJr32 @Abdiaziz1h @Jumpshot8 @Suns That I completely agree with. I wanted the warriors to go after a legitimate big man. Every warriors fan is banking on James Wiseman but what if he’s not it?@ChristianM1225 @Jumpshot8 @Suns About what?@LeviticusSports @AzSvor @eriko_esteban @JVasJr32 @Abdiaziz1h @Jumpshot8 @Suns They had legitimate 5's in those years though. Not the case this year and you can tell@that1mexicano @Jumpshot8 @Suns No they haven’t played that many contenders yet ..@AzSvor @gr73159199 @eriko_esteban @JVasJr32 @Abdiaziz1h @Jumpshot8 @Suns Klay has always been a great defender, and he’ll get back to that@AzSvor @gr73159199 @eriko_esteban @JVasJr32 @Abdiaziz1h @Jumpshot8 @Suns In 2013, 2014, 2015 and 2016 the warriors didn’t have a problem with bigger teams. Klay isn’t a liability on defense, he’s actually been doing well on defense so far this year@LeviticusSports @gr73159199 @eriko_esteban @JVasJr32 @Abdiaziz1h @Jumpshot8 @Suns The last time the warriors were in the playoffs they had KD. Klay is getting hunted on defensive end. Dude is a huge liability on that end of the court now@Abdiaziz1h @Jumpshot8 @Suns Do I need to remind you?🤦‍♂️ https://t.co/iu5ffj1DYi@Sevas_Olmos_ @Suns Mans commented nearly a month later@Jukeboxphd @Jumpshot8 @Suns Lol 😆 there it is@nickthreeHEAT @Jumpshot8 @Suns you can’t be serious@Jumpshot8 @Suns EJ, you are constantly having premature ejaculations for some reason this year regarding the @Suns.

Never. 🤣@statmuse @DevinBook @Suns Damn just six, didnt expect that@leaguefits @DevinBook @Suns Calm fit 🔥For a 9-year-old Suns fan in Phoenix, this was gold. https://t.co/hsiGfZ1kElThe Phoenix Suns are in the top-5 in the NBA in:

I’m close to Phoenix, but alas it has signs of the wear ‘n tear of tyranny.@SunsJAM @Suns 2000-2017 were the dark years for me as far as uniformsIts funny to me how, when the @memgrizz go on an 11 game win streak, @SportsCenter mentions EVERY GAME they win or lose. But when the @Suns were on an 18 game win streak, we got 1 tweet.

He was booking it and we crossed paths down a narrow pathway where I was forced to step out of the way.

As soon as he left Phoenix, that shit dropped right back down.  Hopefully that doesn't happen to Wiggins.@SunsJAM @Suns I made this jersey poster last year and am always surprised when I see it pop up on social media.@alexvvong @dmackerman @jaihockey4 @statmuse @Suns @DeandreAyton Nobody else in this system has that kinda hook shot@Suns i want holiday &amp; torrey craig trade now@ValleySports48 @SunsUniTracker @DanMajerle @AZtradingCards @Suns @AZSportsHistory One of my all time favoritesIf you're looking for an intimate lounge with great vibes and some of the best libations in the Valley of the Sun, look no further than #TheBoomBoomRoom in Phoenix!
