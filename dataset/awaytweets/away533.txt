We my as well just take Fourniers contract as a loss.  U would have to be deaf dumb and blind to pick him@nyknicks Let them go and keep the draft capital we have.  We need to build around a lot of these young guys.  Randle is not part of our future.  Barrett could’ve been but he’s showing major signs of just straight out sucking.  Two players who should be dealt.  Get rid of Randle contract@nyknicks @Infosys Can you make the playoffs with stats?  Asking for a fan…@travbryanmusic @nyknicks I think ur right about Randle.  He’s all up inside his own head.  Barrett idk I think he’s a bust. Mitchell Robinson too unstable and goofy. Fournier is straight trash and worse then inconsistent. Without D Rose we are doomed@nyknicks NY Knicks will totally fall apart in 2022.  Trades need to be made.  Barrett or Randle need to be let go in order to get a good piece to help us win.

I'm surprised Thibs ,throughout his career, hasn't learned how to run a team.@NeoFlight25 @23savage____ @nyknicks You don’t think they watch film?

He’s allowed to have a life…what’s the difference between him playing fortnite or the thousands other athletes who play madden or 2k?

He has free time.  He can use it how he likes.I love my @nyknicks they play today!!

He's better off coming off the bench..While at Madison Square Garden on New Year’s Day 2020 watching @CJMcCollum and @trailblazers vs. @nyknicks, I got word @yankees Legend Don Larsen had passed away. It set the tone for an awful two years. Here’s wishing that today starts a very happy, healthy and “perfect” 2022! https://t.co/INQA7ICDSs@nyknicks And the offense is still a pathetic mess.  Thibs has no clue when it comes to offense.Vintage 1973 Colgate Print Advertisement featuring Walt Frazier New York Knicks  | eBay https://t.co/6CjRxEBG7J@oldham_grant @Jbdabest212 @Andrew_Costley @nyknicks Obi hasn't found a rhythm in 2 years... his jumper just doesn't work@oldham_grant @Jbdabest212 @Andrew_Costley @nyknicks Randle was picked number 7 and only dropped because of his foot surgery. Doesn't matter where you're selected, only matters in how you grow. Randle's grown, Obi remains to seen but he came from a small school and played against some mediocre competition.@Chozy_K @KnicksKaiSZN @nyknicks @MakersMark He barely takes them and this year he’s shooting 25% between 16 ft and the 3 pt line. Last year he was fine.@Chiliz you got the Knicks amd Rangers but when can we expect Chiliz to be listed on coinbase for New York residents?  I'm dying to get in!?Thank god for @NYCFC because the rest of the teams I root for in 2021 @yankees @NYRangers @nyknicks @giants @NDFootball @UConnWBB @StJohnsBBall have all left me bloodied and bruised.RJ Barrett’s faces critical 2022 for the New York Knicks https://t.co/kTuVUlWFaK@Malev0lentt1 @nyknicks @MakersMark was his first career NBA start he'll hopefully improve@h2sdrummer @KnicksKaiSZN @nyknicks @MakersMark From the the few mid range shots I’ve seen him take he can shoot them he just chooses not to idk why but I feel like all he cares about is dunking and 3’s which if he incorporated more into his offense he’d be set@Lasttim53957688 @nyknicks @MakersMark haters are realNeed somebody to come with me to a @nyknicks game@nyknicks They need to get a decent point guard and play some damn defense!@CypressSmurf @Jbdabest212 @Andrew_Costley @nyknicks Also, since you obviously haven't already, watch some of his college highlights. You might learn he can shoot when he finds a rhythm.@CypressSmurf @Jbdabest212 @Andrew_Costley @nyknicks So you think Randle is a god? Obi wasn't picked number 8 for nothing bro... believe what you want@nyknicks @MakersMark Randle is hampering the development of both RJ Barrett and Obi Toppin@nyknicks @MakersMark Bench RandleIs it 2019? Cuz I’m back to complaining about floor spacing when it comes to the Knicks offense. Clearly the @nyknicks don’t want to succeed, they just wanna live off that 90s hype.@ribesmusic @DezSantanaPhoto @GaryHershorn @nycfeelings @BrooklynNets @nyknicks @TimesSquareNYC Happy New Year!Sign Tyson Chandler @nyknicks@BillPidto @MSGNetworks @KnicksMSGN @nyknicks @alanhahn @wallyball Coach Thibs is having a horrible year coaching.  I have lost a lot of respect for him this season.  Him being fired is inevitable. Also, Randle is not not a player worth 4 year 117 million extension.  Not even close.  Knicks will not win anything with Randle.@nyknicks @MakersMark 9.6 is double digits if you round it right@nyknicks @MakersMark Cool now give him more minutesMaking sophomore strides 📈 https://t.co/va1Hh6hFJl@nyknicks @KevKnox GIVE HIM MORE PT@oldham_grant @Jbdabest212 @Andrew_Costley @nyknicks Terrible take. Obi only dunks and ya'll cream your pants over it. I like him for what he is, an energy big. Only as good as his PG allows him to be. Can't shootI haven't bumped this since the original posting so, here goes. 

Ben feels called out. 😅 But it's okay.  Things get better.  Yep, some smut in this chapter.
