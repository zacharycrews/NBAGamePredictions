But the Lakers still have the same win / loss record as the 4th placed Dallas Mavericks üòåHot Takes Pt 2:

4. The Dallas Mavericks will get knocked out in the first round again.
5. Ben Simmons or Kyrie Irving WILL play a game this season.
6. LaMelo Ball and Anthony Edwards are already All Star caliber players and will be the future of the league@dallasmavs @Chime What a disaster. Start rebuilding the roster asap because this team will never get past the first round.
