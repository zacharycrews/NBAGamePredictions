Coming off a win against the Houston Rockets, the Knicks lose to the Chicago Bulls 109-103 on the second leg of their back-to-back. Poor shooting and defense in the fourth quarter costed the Knicks the game.@celtics @HoustonRockets @NBCSBoston @985TheSportsHub GRANT DROPPING 30 https://t.co/o3pZwGXyPY@celtics @HoustonRockets @NBCSBoston @985TheSportsHub Easy win, although Houston has my sympathy. That was suppose to be a fun bunch to watch but instead it looks like a nightmareThe Houston Rockets Chris Paul had a poptart warming up in his shoes.@Stephen0610 @jamesabaileyjr Two specific games I remember were the rockets and blazers. Fournier was on fore vs houston and Cliff pulled him and they went on a big run and cliff proceeded not to bring him back till the game was out of reach.
