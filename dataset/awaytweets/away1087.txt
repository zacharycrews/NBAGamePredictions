You guys sold out. https://t.co/G8rhvRL23J@dubsforever7 @MoonDarkKnight @DanielWAnthro @warriors Bro the system works well enough to win games without Steph. Not a championship, but they should beat most teams on a given night. The warriors have dealt with Steph injuries before under and have played well with their core group pre 2019-20.

@therabody || Inside the Training Room https://t.co/8G6KtY9EyG@Felix10111061 @FWI_Warrior @warriors No, but I question his basketball IQ.   On offense, he just doesn't see the entire court. He's dribbling at the top of key with his back turned to half the court and missing Kuminga cutting from the other side for a wide open dunk.@warriors It's been like this for too much already. https://t.co/3dIWEQYENc@tonyflorimon @CurryPeace @anthonyVslater @warriors They not falling to the play in bro@Felix10111061 @QueenBDOT @warriors No, it seems like that's the Fact that he went to the bench bothered him. 
Which is crazy. 
But that's on the coaching staff acting like "he arrived" he's An All star in the Making"
that's bad to his development to do that.
then he can't hear critics on his defense by a DPOY"I was one of the few guys who actually wanted to stay in the Bay Area."

Sounds about right. Granted not much production and by not much I mean the bare minimum outside of Klay but still how the F they need rest.

Sit back and watch your shitty team.@dubsforever7 @MoonDarkKnight @warriors Klay is still here &amp; despite his struggles, he can still explode. You cut him out, you might as well be forfeiting.

They can do that.@warriors Another loss incoming ffs😭@DanielWAnthro @warriors Obviously can’t expect Jordan to it all but u have to let Jordan handle the ball for majority of the game because there is no one else on the team that is a ball handler.@tonyflorimon @anthonyVslater @warriors Maybe is for that, I think @SteveKerr prefer the 4th position in the West and no the third place. Because he’s throwing away games so easy with incomprehensible decisions. That’s my only explanation, or he’s just a bad coach 🤷🏼‍♂️@FWI_Warrior @warriors The past 3 games not only has he played great but he’s also been sold out by both his brickateers Andrew wiggins and klay Thompson@warriors @Verizon Have some shame, and not post this shit@dubsforever7 @warriors Then, they just gotta work harder, out-hustle, &amp;  make them pay when they do leave someone open. Wiggins needs to get aggressive &amp; go to the hole rather than fading away all night. Can't put this all on Jordan. He ain't ready for that yet.@DanielWAnthro @MoonDarkKnight @warriors When we run the movement system without Steph we lose as well so what we do just give up? No, u run the offense that suits ur best player the most which in this scenario is giving Poole the ball.@Golden302311 New @warriors squad trying to pave their way &amp; @KlayThompson needs to understand that; no more unselfish mentality 🤷🏽‍♂️@dubsforever7 @MoonDarkKnight @warriors No offense btw, I was being facetious. I hear your opinion but it's not working so far. Nor has it previously. When Poole controls the ball this much, Dubs lose. That's what we've seen so far. And, he really needs some defensive focus. All he's worried about is his next shot.@DanielWAnthro @warriors No one can hit 3’s consistently lol + the system creates lanes to cut in when Steph and Klay are there because teams sell out to stop them off the ball but no one is selling out to stop Poole lol@dubsforever7 @warriors Other guys can hit threes, including Jordan playing more off-ball. The system also creates lanes to cut in &amp; they don't have to look for just threes. Give Moody some time. Let Kuminga cut to the rack, etc., etc. Playing iso ball is killing flow &amp; momentum.NEW @LockedOnDubs with @dieter &amp; @ringer’s @wcgoldberg!

He’s good deflecting balls has good hands he’s working on it.

The @warriors should fire Kerr, blow up the system &amp; the squad fresh w/Poole as the new leader because they can't win w/o Steph in that system, right? He's getting old. Let's hand the reigns over to Poole now before we waste his talent. 😂🤣😂🤡💩@vivenoe @warriors Honestly they do at least I can sit back and know we have rings@DanielWAnthro @warriors They can run it sure but it’s not effective. The whole point of the movement system was to get everybody on the team good shots and looks using the advantage creation of Steph and Klay, they aren’t here for this game.@vivenoe @warriors Yeah and yall ain’t beating us to go to the finalsWATCH: Arkansas coach Eric Musselman previews Sweet 16 matchup with Gonzaga on Wednesday from Chase Center, home of the Golden State Warriors #wps #arkansas #razorbacks #Sweet16 #NCAATournament (FREE): https://t.co/ZSbHbh2ZSY@warriors please grab Willie Cauley-Stein or someone who can grab at least 3 rebounds.

No one creates advantages off the ball like Steph meaning those open lanes won’t get created lol + we don’t have shooters to run the movement system without Steph@dubsforever7 @warriors I've watched them run the movement system for 10 years. Steph is the best at it. He's not the only one. They still run it w/Dray as point forward. Iggy runs it too. Giving it to 1 guy to hold it for 18 seconds per possession = Ls for the @warriors. If he drops 60, we still lose.@BeKindGoodVibes @warriors Is Not Bright Then.@KawhisFavBurner @warriors he is. No defense whatsoever.@DanielWAnthro @warriors Well Said. Because it's true.

He doesn't Even defend.@warriors thanks, I really wanted to see your bench play tonight.@warriors Such a Great Impact on Winning.... https://t.co/m48uqW0Afg@RadlantChaln @anthonyVslater IT is that playing with a Pivot and an AP that do not add 10 points between the 2 and a very bad defense is difficult to win. On offense the @warriors play 3v2 against any @NBA team https://t.co/OYccOY45jd@DanielWAnthro @warriors U can’t run the movement system without Steph lol, it’s not effective without Steph, which is why u have to put the ball in Poole’s hands and let him cook@dubsforever7 @warriors And, the best player on the team is Steph. Come on, man!@Myles2D @TheStilt69 @NBAMemes HE WAS NOT A SCRUB PLAYER , BRO

Needs better focus on D &amp; help the offensive flow more rather than holding the ball so much a la Harden. Get your teammates involved early. Help them find their shots. #DubNation@CurryPeace @anthonyVslater If they keep losing games, the @Warriors will lose the PlayOff spots and fall into the Play-in and last year they were eliminated in that series.The Golden State Warriors are usually cool, calm and collected.

If your keep playing like your can not beat the worst team or teams, your will end up in 6, 7, 8, 9 or 10 seed period. POOR, POOR, POOR, POOR COACHING  AND POOR DECISION MAKING IN EVERY 4TH QUARTER.

GSW coaches are suck and just sitting around. I think it is time to replace GSW coaches. GSW players are playing soft, stupid, bad judgement, low basketball IQ/decision making, etc. Your making millions for nothing. Excuses?@JimmySportPicks @warriors I honestly knew the magic would cover this game the warriors have burned me all season even when healthy so i went w magic w confidence tonight@Heat793543882 @GIANNIIS34MVP @warriors we should be able to beat a fucking 20 win team without himFranz Wagner made three free throws with 12.2 seconds left and dunked on an inbounds play for the final points, leading the Orlando #Magic to a 94-90 win over the Golden State Warriors on Tuesday night.  #NBATwitter #NBA https://t.co/oq4Aw6UQteWarriors' Draymond Green: 'We're not playing good basketball and we're getting punked' #GoldenState #Warriors #NBA https://t.co/KAnGEfUIJy@warriors Anyone notice these stats are totally wrong lmao.

Media credits him for winning though. Top 15 Coach of all time can’t coach his way to a W over the @OrlandoMagic @warriors deserve better coaching games like this we should be winning.Good news after watching the terrible @warriors loss today 😒 https://t.co/K3S9sHO244@gogobobo711 @warriors Then u forgot about the two playoff series Kerr won without curry and had klay carrying their offense, fake ass stats@warriors Do ANY of the players on this team understand that all the fancy plays and nice shots you make don’t mean shit IF YOU DON’T WIN THE GAME?!?!?@Warriors' Dub Nation should be prepare to suffer "via crucis" ending regular season with Steph injured plus Klay+Dray not yet at 100%. Even to win in playoffs and advancing to finals for "championship" goal are in JEOPARDY as of many more complete+healthy teams competing for it. https://t.co/KUPVuZTeFJ@Glitchy3x @warriors It’s bad bro 😭😭 we can’t keep a lead. We need curry backA lot of teams get in a funk every now and then.

Right now, my Golden State Warriors are stinking up the joint.

This latest loss was strictly on the players, there is absolutely NO excuse for the pitiful 4th quarter that doomed them once again.@warriors They should really consider trading Klay in the offseason and build around JP and Curry. They won’t win the ship this year with Klay@brilqh @nachovisconti_ @warriors yup curry is such a fraud man he wasn’t even playing in this game and u brought him up. shows u love him. https://t.co/XXC0t8F8kN@vHephaestus @warriors lmfao makes sensePpl are gonna hate me for saying this but we should make the trade on klay @warriors need a big man presence.

Their shooting has never been smooth for the past months that's the reason why they're having a hard time winning.@warriors Every Time there a Lead, @SteveKerr  let Kuminga destroy it, while watching on the bench...

I checked the math. Before any bonus (all star game/playoffs) or tax, Wiggins is making more than   $390,000 a game.

 @22wiggins can you be downgraded to G league along with Looney? Stu**id players!this is the same team who gave up 60 &amp; 50 points to Kyrie and Saddiq on a back to back games... but on the other hand, this warriors team is having a brick fest lmao @warriors what's happening?? 🥱🥱@warriors 2 games no offensive adjustments under 40PTS in both 1st halfs!! Sometimes you have to break away from the equal opportunity offense and run plays or force feed your best players! KD was right about that part sometimes you have to ISO/feature your studs. JP, Klay, Wigs!@warriors @22wiggins the most garbage nigga I ever seen y’all title hopes are over lmaoooo. GM need to trade him while the value high dude just does not care about winning or scoring.That was atrocious.

Predictably, it’s a turnover (between two magic players 💀). And then there is no accountability. Imagine if Poole or kuminga threw that 😂@ImaGoddessT @OrlandoMagic @warriors Yea he is but nobody is making shots the only one playing well is opjMasterclass by the @warriors thus far.
