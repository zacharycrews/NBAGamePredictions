On Saturday night, against another contender, they got one. The story from Miami, is here - https://t.co/zdtKVIEplY29 PTS on 11-18 shooting for Tyler Herro tonight. He's taking another leap forward, one of the best jump shooters in the NBA

His ability to score off the bounce, make tough ones or drill C&amp;S looks off different actions is elite. All were on display tonight vs. Utah Jazz https://t.co/CZ8g1dBKYFNBA FINAL SCORES (Saturday, November 6th)

Hopefully, you are right.@cpicco @BuckleUpBoler @utahjazz Anomaly? Naw, JC will be fine. Not many “feel” touches today. It’s the way the game goes sometimes.Game tonight was interesting. Glad they fought late, but wished I would have seen it early. Whiteside played much better in the end but was very lazy in the first 3 quarters. Rudy struggled. The rough shooting is worrisome, but it’s just game 9. #takenote @utahjazz #shootbetterWith The Utah Jazz Loss To The Miami Heat, The Golden State Warriors Are Now Not Only 1st In The West, But They Have The Best Record Across The NBA.  #DubNation@kslsports @utahjazz @MiamiHEAT best analysis so farHero ball!

👉 Excellent 4th Q for the Jazz💪 https://t.co/zq3lfAB1oGFinal Thoughts: Miami managed to stave off a 22-6 Utah Jazz run led by Donovan Mitchell, Royce O'Neale, and Jordan Clarkson. The Heat's offense improved from the last game, which saw them knock down a barrage of three-pointers from Tyler Herro.@BEANSINPAIN @utahjazz My only guess is that he shot that so they couldn’t foul but still my god that was terribleBigger.

There will be performance variance over the course of an 82 game season, but the Heat now add the league-best Utah Jazz to the list of good teams they've beaten.
