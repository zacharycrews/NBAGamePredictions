Bet slip link: https://t.co/5oN5wniyUY https://t.co/tiVGmGsbZ0Wanted to add the Pelicans this evening, had seen the line drop to -4.5 earlier, now back at 6.

Projections have a more comfortable win ~8-10 points for New Orleans, disagree with Sagarin (~4.5)

That said, I hate getting the worst of it, so likely pass.Indian Cowboy

Lol. Nobody in New Orleans care about the pelicans. It‚Äôs LSU and the saints.

10* New Orleans PelicansI never hear anyone say the Pacers &amp; Magic are poverty teams. I don‚Äôt even remember these teams being relaxant as of late. They LOVE to speak on the Pelicans though. I‚Äôm beginning to think they just hate New Orleans as a whole‚Ä¶The last time New Orleans won a season series vs. Houston during an 82-game season was 2010-11, the one season Willie Green was a PLAYER for New Orleans. #Pelicans did win the season series over Rockets in 2020-21, but it was only three games due to #NBA shortened 72-game slatePhiladelphia Joe
