As a result, Claxton never got the one skill that’d unlock his NBA career—setting screens. If you could merge Clax+Bruce, he’d be the perfect player.@BrooklynNets go get John wall or some man damn we needa pgStill a coon. You literally said that the Brooklyn Nets should drop Kyrie because if his "selfishness", but now you only want Aaron Rodgers to be suspended? Kyrie has done so much to help black people, and all you did was demonize him. You a coon bro. https://t.co/2XhY2alUsT@vicecity4life @BrooklynNets Ridiculous how they’ll allow unvaccinated opponents to come play against us in Barclay’s but when our own teammate wants to play they don’t allow it 😶‍🌫️@AdamArmbrecht @LockedOnNets @BrooklynNets @ATLHawks @DougNorrie This seemed like a very intentional course-correction after Kerr came really close to fatally mismanaging Wiseman last year. Nets could use such a guy with former head coach gravitas for Clax, Cam, Sharpe &amp; Co. Brett Brown?@AdamArmbrecht @LockedOnNets @BrooklynNets @ATLHawks @DougNorrie Any theory on what’s actually going on with Claxton? If only it were politically feasible for the Nets to do what the Warriors did—hire Kenny Atkinson to run a development fiefdom for your high-upside side projects till they’re able to deliver along your thirtysomething stars.Analyzing Friday’s Brooklyn Nets at Detroit Pistons odds and lines, with NBA expert picks, predictions and best bets.  https://t.co/dd5ZeNJxC2@DetroitPistons @BrooklynNets @BallySportsDET @971theticketxyt @Shopify @LCArena_Detroit I will be there tonight and I can't wait.

Lets go @BrooklynNets@endasher @DougNorrie @LockedOnNets @BrooklynNets @ATLHawks Yeah for sure the value of Allen and Claxton not 1:1 which is why Allen is no longer a Net. A healthy Spencer Dinwiddie would certainly have made a broader, more flexible trade market.@BrooklynNets Phila slapped Pistons yesterday 
We have no reason not to win this match tonight, Defence is all we ask cuz Jerami Grant can deadly like he was last night@BrooklynNets Im feeling like the Knicks are better@AdamArmbrecht @DougNorrie @LockedOnNets @BrooklynNets @ATLHawks 😢 But I don’t think you could’ve traded Claxton *instead* of Allen, for salary and simple value. Cavs obviously thought he was worth $20m a year. 

Big what-if is Dinwiddie. Surely, a PG-needy team would’ve taken the Cavs leg of the Harden trade if he was healthy.@BrooklynNets Let's take some nice wins on the road@BrooklynNets Kyrie could play in away games...@endasher @LockedOnNets @BrooklynNets @ATLHawks @DougNorrie I think the “dream scenario” is Aldridge, Millsap, Griffin, Claxton and Sharpe(😏) fill their niches successfully because there isn't a one-stop solution out there to go get.@DetroitPistons @BrooklynNets @BallySportsDET @971theticketxyt @Shopify @LCArena_Detroit On our way from the Yoop right now!@BrooklynNets SCARY HOURS@MasonMcFarlane0 @DetroitPistons @BrooklynNets @BallySportsDET @971theticketxyt @Shopify @LCArena_Detroit Yeah they’re wearing the redsLimited tickets still available for 1/15/22 and 2/13/22 Celtics games.

📌 @LCArena_Detroit https://t.co/4bDViTII2E@endasher @AdamArmbrecht @LockedOnNets @BrooklynNets @ATLHawks I would give up the playmaking for the other things. Think that's way less important for the current iteration of the Nets. But guard 1-5 (ish) on perimeter switches and have the athleticism to finish pick and dive stuff, sure. I'll take that@AdamArmbrecht @LockedOnNets @BrooklynNets @ATLHawks @DougNorrie Wait, so you want a big defensive paint presence who can also provide gravity on the perimeter and play-make? I think this requires a time machine more than trade machine—call up 2016 LaMarcus or Marc Gasol.

Sell me on why I should become a #Raptors fan. I have been a Nets fan since the first ABA season when they were the NJ Americans.But at this point, it is impossible to be a Brooklyn Nets fan@BrooklynNets I love it - how do we get our hands on a Patty Mills jersey? Please link us asap.@Randomp00711062 @ravnsforev3r @statmuse @KDTrey5 @BrooklynNets @KingJames just like Bol Bol then😂all that categorising stuff of "big" or "guard" is all superficial, at the end of the day he's still heads and shoulders above people and shooting that rock like a mfer and thanks to his height nobody is gonna guard it, so he still has that same advantage@NBA @KDTrey5 @BrooklynNets Doesn’t miss@NickDePaula @OU_MBBall @blakegriffin23 @boardroom @ESPNNBA @TheUndefeated @BrooklynNets There’s gotta be something up with the fit or something with the 36, seems like everyone still rocking with the 35’s this year.@TheRealPavlova @BrooklynNets @barclayscenter I had to be there for history's sake.@TimCapstraw @ChrisCarrino @Paulmillsap4 @BrooklynNets @BKNetsRadio His “Good!!!” Is just as exciting as Marv Albert’s “Yes!!”@WarrenWymore @GovKathyHochul @BrooklynNets @barclayscenter Yup we are sure.

If you want a republican governor move to FloridaBro wanna be a Brooklyn Net really bad https://t.co/tIoKohoms3@BrooklynNets every night@MikeKing00 I don't know how to break this to you but this is not a NJ Nets court. Make no mistake this is one of many Brooklyn Nets courts that have been showcased  over the last couple of years. This one reflecting their years in the Garden State.Brooklyn Nets Kyrie Irving Jordan Brand Jersey
