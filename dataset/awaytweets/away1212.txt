2021-22 (post-Feb. 1): +2.9 (5) https://t.co/aVDl49XbYSHere's a fun stat I just looked up- New Orleans Pelicans guard Tony Snell has not missed a free throw in more than 3 years. Made his last 50 attempts- last miss came March 12, 2019, 163 games ago (not including playoffs- but hasn't missed in playoffs during that stretch- 0-0ft)A good move for @PelicansNBA would be to reach out with some @ThePels12 across the state.  Outside of New orleans there is very little reach.  Hard to watch them on TV.  Almost like they don't exist unless you're poking for themHoop action starts at 1pm/et today!

Philadelphia 76ers look to stay in race for East 3-seed, New Orleans Pelicans can clinch 9th with a win and Golden State Warriors look to hold 3-seed out West!
