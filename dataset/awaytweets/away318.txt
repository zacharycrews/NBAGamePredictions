Pick#1: NBA  Atlanta Hawks ML +100
Pick#2: NBA  Denver Nuggets -8.5 (-110)
Pick#3: NBA Cleveland Cavaliers +7.5 (-110)@gallinari8888 @ATLHawks if you were not Gallo I could say it was luckThe Atlanta Hawks need some of their rotation players to step up in the absence of their key wings. Delon Wright could be one to work his way into a greater role. #TrueToAtlanta

https://t.co/pXz6YEjaNo@ATLHawks @ArrowExt SWAT Team@MirannLolani I don‚Äôt know what happened to the Kings fan base. Nobody really cares. It‚Äôs like we are the Atlanta Hawks. My kid barely knows anyone at school who cares about the Kings. I guess it started after 2006 but it‚Äôs really sad. This team used to have unbelievable support.@ItWasAKindness @Collipark49 @FirstTake @stephenasmith @jj_redick You mean the same way Phoenix played well in last year's regular season? This is just another Atlanta Hawks situation. They're gonna lose once they play a real contender in the playoffs (Healthy Clippers, Lakers, Warriors, Nets, Bucks, Heat.)What do you all think about this? Can it happen like mid 2010s Atlanta Hawks? https://t.co/MbhoDtsJ38Waka Flocka Announces NBA Partnership With Atlanta Hawks For ‚ÄòSKRIT‚Äô Streetwear Collaboration https://t.co/ny6cfk1OKm #music #feedly@AYakatally @ATLHawks You know that team that took you guys down 4-1 in the first round last year?@nba_paint @camreddish @ATLHawks @DrSeuss Somewhere @JackEasterby is cackling@PickDawgz Atlanta Hawks +1.5 -120/ Houston Rockets +3.5 -120/ Michigan Wolverines -1.5  -110@PickDawgz #247 Atlanta Hawks +1.5  -110/Houston Rockets  +3.5 -110/ Michigan Wolverines -1.5  -110@AYakatally Weird, the @ATLHawks didn't play tonightSo @ATLHawks next time you come play the @Raptors at @ScotiabankArena please bring @lecrae to perform at halftime@kelvi2k @ATLHawks @fridge62777254 honestly man like sometimes my cum is just complettely blue and opaque@ATLHawks Is cam back@ATLHawks Who‚Äôs got 20+ at 2 guard?
