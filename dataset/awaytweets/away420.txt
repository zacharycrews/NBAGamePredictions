https://t.co/u8xjRmYAwNIf I’m the Pelicans, I’m trading Zion Williamson ASAP. He’s not staying in New Orleans long term and his health is a major concern. There’s a team, maybe the Knicks that will offer a ton for him. Take what you can get now #NBA75@tomhaberstroh needs to vet his new orleans sports info… 2015 play off run was the jump off point for interest in this team, clearly he aint been back since. also it is:

https://t.co/5Xwlp0xEJeNew Orleans Pelicans shirt - teebamboo https://t.co/VAUGuwIGHdJust posted a photo @ New Orleans Pelicans https://t.co/GE0x7kFqbc@neyonirvana That's not about Zion but the team. That's New Orleans Pelicans not Williamson's Pelicans. He's not paid to make Zion sign an extension, but to put a good team on the court and he failed.
Idc if Zion is stayin or not, the team has to be good, Zion or not.
