He is our starter will be 👍 good.@killakell14 @GregSylvander @MiamiHEAT @5OTF_ No but giving up the three ball and not being able to shoot it is a major flaw.

Not easy to be a big in the NBA &amp; hasn't proven he can shoot.@kirkgoldsberry @warriors @utahjazz @MiamiHEAT @WashWizards @chicagobulls Tyrese Maxey and George Niang currently have the best offense in the leagueThe Miami Heat are generating the most corner 3's in the league – 11.5% of their total shots come from the corners.

Problem is, they are shooting just 33.3% on those, which ranks 25th in the league.

Really ? now you carry on 😁🤫i was like whoa Lakers beat the Heat?? before i even looked i thought "i bet Miami shot like 20% from 3 and Lakers shot  best so far this season 45% or something crazy" 

cause Miami should beat them 4 out of 5 times w/o Lebron.

3pt:

Miami 10-37 (27%)
Lakers 18-38 (48%)

YEPP.Anybody notice that the @MiamiHEAT have a player from each of the last 3 NBA championships? PJ Tucker, Morris, Lowry.

#LEGENDoftheMiamiHEAT #NBA75@kirkgoldsberry @warriors @utahjazz @MiamiHEAT @WashWizards @chicagobulls That the jazz shot are number 2 offense while shooting 22nd best from three after leading the league last year. That’s scary room for improvement. We are talking greatest offense of all time possibilities herei can’t watch first take anymore perk is killin me. how are the warriors not playoff experienced enough but the heat are??? they got 5 players who went to the finals 5 years in a row but miamis 1 finals appearance makes them vets lmaoComing out the restroom, some dude yelled out “yo! You from New York?!” and we ended up chopping it up. Miami Heat fan but I was chillin’ on them yesterday cause I wanted them to get the W. Healthy dialogue between me and the brother lol@MiamiHEAT 3rd straight loss I fearI think the Miami Heat are serious title contenders this season. They have a fine roster with Kyle, Herro, Adebayo, Jimmy Butler, Kief Morris, Victor Oladipo and co.Why this pic look like the DVD cover of a film where Kyle Lowry gets killed in the beginning which inspires Bam to leave the street life alone, make it to the NBA, and get their momma out the hood.

MIA 117 - LAL 120

- The refereeing was horrendous against Miami. I would rank it worst this season by far.

- Duncan and Kyle’s constant inefficient games kill us. Can probably get away with one inefficient scorer, but two puts the dagger

He's a one dimensional player. If he isn't hitting 3's then he's basically useless, and a liability out there.

This team will continue to struggle if he plays big mins.@theheatOWNyou @Wadesburner @MiamiHEAT Choking on a WIDE OPEN 3. Lmfao off!!!!!

Such was this evening for Miami.@FrankyAbrego @MiamiHEAT More like 100monk still owns u @MiamiHEAT@MiamiHEAT Cant lose this gameWork on FTs tomorrow,ok? @MiamiHEAT@MiamiHEAT We should have won this game but   missed a lot of free throws But it was still a good game@MiamiHEAT Duncan Robinson literally can't do the one thing he get paid to do. 11 games being broke isn't a slump. #straightTrashIt makes me sick to my stomach that this game could be a springboard for Westbrook. I’d rather have Martin out there instead of Duncan. #MiamiHeat@MiamiHEAT If Duncan keep playing like this, you can start to considering to trade him. For a guy who can only shoot 3pt and a defensive liability, he doesn't deserve that contract. This duncan situation is kinda similar with tyler johnson contract#MiamiHeat  way to soft for Dwight Howard, 6 fouls but only 1 legit foul. And you know it.😉 #Lakeshow@MiamiHEAT I love watching games like these but it really sucks when we don't take the W 💔 https://t.co/CCfGZLCRg2@MiamiHEAT Sick to my stomach I cant believe this@isb0121 @MiamiHEAT I loss this one also.

Miami made its final nine field goals in the 1H. Herro has a game-high 15 points on 6-10 shooting with three 3-pointers. He's the only Miami player with more than two made FG's. Heat legend Avery Bradley has 14 points while Davis has 13.Miami got nothing from Bam, had no Jimmy in the second, and the Lakers shot the lights out from 3. 

And the Heat go into the half up 2 somehow. Gotta be happy with that 🔥🔥🔥#HEATCultureHalftime: Heat 57, Lakers 55

Avery Bradley leads the Lakers with 14 points off four 3s. Anthony Davis has 13 points and 6 rebounds. AD and Dwight Howard frustrated Miami inside. The Lakers are 9 of 21 (42.9%) from deep. That half featured some of LA's better defense this season.@MiamiHEAT Damn, hate to see it.
