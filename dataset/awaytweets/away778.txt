Sacramento is playing good defense but Brooklyn still can’t feel good about themselves. Harden is a zero tonight and they’ve gotten beat in the last two periods now.

Nets not getting a lot from Harden and Irving offensively, but can use them the most at times likes these. Sacramento's defense isn't too far from mine.I feel like Sacramento Kings fans have mixed opinions/feelings on this.

Via Cleaning the Glass https://t.co/qXqo26GD5z@bansky Can we at least let Sacramento get at least one playoff performance? Kids in sac are about to graduate high school never in their lifetime having kings in playoffs.@GrayHendrix @SacramentoKings Do better sactownHalftime: Nets lead the Kings 62-54. Sacramento has shaved BK's lead down a few times and they've responded each time. Nic Claxton on pace to shatter his career-high and Kyrie Irving's dozen has been huge. James Johnson giving the Nets' good minutes tonight.Nets lead the Kings 62-54 at the half in Sacramento. Nic Claxton one point from matching his career high, has 17. Harrison Barnes leads Sacramento with 12.Nets got 62 and Kings got 54. Let the nets keep scoring on you Sacramento fans out here🙏🏼Losing to Orlando and OKC back to back?!

That's on some Sacramento Kings type shit.

Yuck @dallasmavs.Who told the @SacramentoKings that @Coolio is his favorite artist?!?!

#SacramentoProud@GrayHendrix @SacramentoKings I saw that too people are weird manSacramento kings fans pointing lasers at Brooklyn Nets players.  #nba #sacramentokings #brooklynnets https://t.co/CeTKxKZJqxY’all are dropping the ball @SacramentoKings   Light fire under y’all asses and get it done. Do you want victory? #Kings #Nets https://t.co/VkNM3HO7otA fan at the Kings-Nets game is pointing a laser at Patty Mills as he sits on the bench @SacramentoKings https://t.co/pizyGlVGKt@rednbluengreen @SacramentoKings Shit was horrible bruhDid you just see @Patty_Mills have someone at the @SacramentoKings game shine a laser in his eyes and face??? What the!?!?Nets this year:
12.9 OP TOVs per game (27th)
14.9 PTS off TOVs (24th)

Nets tonight vs the Kings:
9 OP TOVs
16 PTS off TOVs

This seems to be a product of sloppy play from Sacramento than stingy Brooklyn defense, but they're getting points in new places regardless tonight.Sacramento Kings - Brooklyn Nets

K-Fed even name drops them in the “Crazy” remix &amp; got a SUPER BOWL ad with Nationwide insurance in 2007. Nationwide was a corporate sponsor for the Sacramento Kings, which were owned by the Maloofs. https://t.co/qd5emyUwvP@DeuceMason Man the Stockton kings play way harder than the Sacramento Kings.Kings fans what are you doing besides watching the @SacramentoKings ?

I'm watching @bobafetti swear the refs are against the kings…even at home the away team is always at the line or they’re calling offensive fouls on sacramento…Nets lead the Kings 32-23 after one.

Sacramento buried a few threes to take an early lead but Brooklyn exploded out past them in the first period’s final few minutes. Great run from Kyrie and Clax.

Irving: 10 PTS, 3-5 FGs
Claxton: 11 PTS, 3 REBS@SacramentoKings are disgusting to watch. #nets #kings@SacramentoKings  BUDDY HIELD IS FUCKING TERRIBLE.
