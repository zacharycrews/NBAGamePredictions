Sacramento is playing good defense but Brooklyn still can‚Äôt feel good about themselves. Harden is a zero tonight and they‚Äôve gotten beat in the last two periods now.

Claxton: 21 PTS, 8 REBS
Johnson: 14 PTS, 6-7 FGsJames Harden has 2 points going into the 4th quarter against the Sacramento Kings‚Ä¶ am I reading this correctly‚Ä¶?Sacramento Kings, :21 seconds of perfect defense. üí™üèæüî•@SacramentoKings @James_HamNBA @TheDougChristie  why does Alex  Len not play????!!Claxton with 21 points and Neemias Queta with zero minutes played? wtf @SacramentoKings @James_HamNBA 
#NBAnaSPORTTV #NBATwitterLive@KNlCKSPLEASEWIN He got klay in the same paragraph as Levert. I think this is probably an executive with the Sacramento Kings considering how he's pretty dumbKings have made this a five-point game. Nets lead 80-75 with 3:34 left in the third quarter. Nets not getting a lot from Harden and Irving offensively, but can use them the most at times likes these. Sacramento's defense isn't too far from mine.I feel like Sacramento Kings fans have mixed opinions/feelings on this.

Should the Kings trade De‚ÄôAaron Fox?@SacramentoKings Trade Barnes bagley hield Robert Woodard Tristan Thompson and davion Mitchell other ones can also be Ramsey and king@SacramentoKings Another grease ass lube game for kings. Thank you sir may i have anotherI want so very badly for @hbarnes to be a part of a winning team in Sacramento.
