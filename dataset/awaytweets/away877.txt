https://t.co/rYInXRrFGH@RiverTamYDN I am sure Utah Jazz coach Quinn Snyder could give Mike Lee a little bit of insight as to Kanter's limitations as a player and why that organization decided on Rudy Gobert over Enes Kanter, even though Kanter was a former #3 overall pick.2022 Bet of the Day: (23-17-1)

Jazz have won 5 straight easily. Rudy Gobert is back. Lakers are still nothing special, Bradley and Carmelo are out, and AD and Lebron are both questionable.

#TheHunt | #OurGame https://t.co/B1Bhp5x8L4@FanficsUtahJazz and the threat at the rim that is Rudy Gobert.

What Bogdanovic does for the Utah Jazz, it takes precision and maturity. It takes selflessness to know he may get 22 shots in one game, or 10 the next game.So many! I follow NHL and NBA closest, so these come to mind:
2003 Ottawa Senators
1998 Utah Jazz
2006 Edmonton Oilers
2004 Calgary Flames
1994 NY Knicks
2010 Boston Celtics
2013 San Antonio Spurs https://t.co/KANWqr4eFF@FanficsUtahJazz Or do much of anything that you see nightly on highlight shows. Because of this, the veteran Utah Jazz small forward is often the forgotten man in what is a juggernaut offense when the Jazz core is healthy and together.

Bogdanovic is more like “The Terminator”.I just added “Utah Jazz vs Los Angeles Lakers Prediction 2/16/22 - Free NBA Picks” to Free NBA Picks on #Vimeo: https://t.co/8pHkJPZZfS@utahjazz @vivintarena @spidadmitchell So PreciousThe Utah Jazz are reportedly adding another player on a two-way contract
