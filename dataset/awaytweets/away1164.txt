There's 3 other guys they can go at to get to the rim. Which ultimately leads rob to bring more important to Celtics overall defense than smart. Again no knock on smart. He's insanely good@utjazzmuse @rudygobert27 @celtics @utahjazz @BucketsONeale00 @epaschall Rim protection is important, I agree. But preventing your man from even getting to the rim is Marcus’ forte.@Jayden___W @CJRealHoops1 @MUSSemeritus It is old, I’ll give you that. But they also won the game we’re talking about. I don’t usually wear a Utah Jazz 1998 Finals appearance T-shirt.@profit_wallet Good project

Quote Tweet@bojixbabaian @rudygobert27 @celtics @utahjazz @BucketsONeale00 @epaschall Defensive position. Rim protectors who can switch like gobert and Rob Williams are just more valuable regular season defenders. Marcus smart is probably more versatile and effective than gobert in a playoff setting@mariluzcook @utahjazz Love it! Congratulations 🥰@bojixbabaian @rudygobert27 @celtics @utahjazz @BucketsONeale00 @epaschall You're right he affects the game much more because not only is he guarding his guy, he's effectively guarding everyone who comes down the lane on a drive by rotating over. That's obviously not a knock on Marcus Smart, he's amazing. He just plays a less important regular season
1/@utjazzmuse @rudygobert27 @celtics @utahjazz @BucketsONeale00 @epaschall I’ll gather the stats. In the meantime, please understand that Smart has proven to guard all 5 positions. Gobert is great, not saying he’s not, but he doesn’t effect the game like Smart does.#NBA75 PHILIPPINE SCHEDULE

Better defensive rating despite having a worse defensive team around himTerance Mann has 18.  His career high*, which he's had twice, is 25.

That's his regular season career high.  He did, and not many people know this, score 39 points in game 6 of the second round last year to eliminate the Utah Jazz.Game-Time Decisions: Golden State Warriors (48-29) Vs. Utah Jazz (45- 31) Saturday, April 2, 2022.
