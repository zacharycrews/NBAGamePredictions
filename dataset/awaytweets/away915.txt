#FreePick https://t.co/deyYENLAIL@Vadersback36 @money_talks65 @TheHoopCentral Small-Ball, a mid-season creation 1st reared it’s ugly head during the win against the Indiana Pacers. Point Center has an EXTRA SHOOTER on the court to pass the ball to. 😂😂😂😂 Notice I didn’t say EXTRA SHOOTER for Westbrook to pass the ball to.The Orlando Magic opened as a 1 point favorite against Indiana. They are now up to 2.5.

Do you understand what I just said? The 14-47 Orlando Magic are getting sharp money as a FAVORITE against the 21-41 Indiana Pacers who just beat the Boston Celtics.

Choose wisely.@WhatsYaWager @BovadaOfficial @thePatMorrow #whatsyawager

Indiana could benefit from adding an immediate impact wing to strengthen their perimeter defense.

https://t.co/TId58kCM64
https://t.co/TId58kCM64Former Indiana Pacers coach and Grizzlies executive Dick Versace has passed away at 81. Versace was a groundbreaker. He was the first American of Puerto Rican descent to coach in the NBA. Versace was longtime broadcaster on Turner Sports coverage of the NBA."It’s been 418 days since Orlando Magic point guard Markelle Fultz suited up in an NBA game. However, that drought ends tonight when he makes his long-awaited return to the court against the Indiana Pacers in central Florida Monday night."
