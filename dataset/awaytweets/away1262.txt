Thanks@Eyeamog @Timberwolves @memgrizz 3/ His main value is defense. I’m not saying he shouldn’t play, but he is not playing so great that these other guards should not be getting minutes. They have proven that they are more than capable, especially in front of their home crowd.@Eyeamog @Timberwolves @memgrizz 2/ to play off them at a high level. I’m telling you that the other two guys have more offensive firepower than Bev. His game 3 was okay, but that’s not sustainable for him. Nowell was a 24ppg scorer in college and is a bucket. McLaughlin is much faster.@MEM_Parks @memgrizz @MemRiverParks Can’t wait!!! Can we bring coolers?@Eyeamog @Timberwolves @memgrizz 1/ Pat Bev is a point guard who doesn’t play like a point guard. You have 3 players on the team capable of getting 30 on a given night. He doesn’t create for them. What’s worse is that he doesn’t create for himself enough to justify not creating for them and not being able@memgrizz game 5 white out, make it happen@kjoseph1tiger @langwhitaker @SLAMonline @memgrizz SLAM website@langwhitaker @SLAMonline @memgrizz The question is, do we test out the luckiness of it yet?@NBA @dariusgarland22 @cavs @JaMorant @memgrizz @DejounteMurray @spurs Come on Dejounte!@suppaduppadread I got my nap in so I'm ready for 9pm

The playoffs are the time to lower your variance not increase them. That's why lineups shrink. I just don't see the point of taking a guy out when you went up 25 points twice. That clearly wasn't the problem. First fix what's broken 2/@brucegelin @Timberwolves @memgrizz Maybe it is an anomaly... But you expecting those two guys to come off the bench in a playoffs and perform better would be to expect an even greater anomaly.

You may NEED them in the future if there is foul trouble or injury. Tonight is the night to do it.@Eyeamog @Timberwolves @memgrizz 2/ The other thing is that bench players typically play well at home and struggle on the road. When they go back to Memphis, that's when you really rely on KAT, D-Lo, and Ant to carry you, along with Pat Bev's presence and veteran savvy.@Eyeamog @Timberwolves @memgrizz 1/ That was an anomaly for Pat Bev. And frankly, when he takes shots, it's usually out of the flow of things, and it hurts the team. Edwards got hurt and was never the same, but if you are the point guard, how does Ant get 13 shots and KAT get 4? That's partly on you.@yrntga @memgrizz South Africa@memgrizz i hope you win 💪@lukapaguro @JaMorant @memgrizz Cheers man!@CoryMizer @JaMorant @memgrizz Thanks Cory, appreciate it@MadeBySil @JaMorant @memgrizz Stunning Sil@MadeBySil @JaMorant @memgrizz This is stunning, man.

I am trying to take my grandsonI have shot for (with compensation) Ja Morant, Jaren Jackson Jr + the Memphis Grizzlies, countless music artists and influencers, as well as business owners and have been featured in GQ, We Are Memphis, Kids Take Over &amp; more.

They're ready. Kuminga can't see the floor in GS, because OTHERS (less talented i.e. Iggy) have been there, done that. IMHO You roll w/Trustworthy guys till they implode. /3@memgrizz Been with you since the first year in Vancouver!! 🐻@brucegelin @Timberwolves @memgrizz JA was 5-18...Bev was part of the reason. He'll bounce back,but you want to risk him going for 40 on the guys who haven't played? You usually change something that was a clear problem. Pat Bev wasn't. 
They lost because ANT &amp; KAT didn't show up. PERIOD (and ur not benching them)@memgrizz Y'all making it hard lol Tyson fury fight is tonightFirst pool day of the SUMMER!

Memphis Grizzlies are playing.

Vibes. The ultimate Saturday.@brucegelin @Timberwolves @memgrizz Not saying they shouldn't trust their bench, but you appealed for them to take out the guy who was their 3rd highest scorer and sparked the ENTIRE first 25pt lead--for guys who haven't played in a big game in their life.

Memphis Grizzlies / Cornell Big Red https://t.co/DFcoQ4QHbH@Eyeamog @Timberwolves @memgrizz 2/ They were the highest scoring regular season team, and it was largely due to their bench. Coach has to trust them the Memphis trusts theirs.@memgrizz Of course honey@Eyeamog @Timberwolves @memgrizz 1/ Morant struggled early, but worked his way back into the flow after Tyus Jones and the rest of the bench helped get the team back in it. Not sure we can expect too many more mediocre performances from Ja. But MIN has scored 95 and 96 points in the last 2 games.Minnesota Timberwolves vs Memphis Grizzlies is on ESPN App (US).
