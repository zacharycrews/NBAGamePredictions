Bet slip link: https://t.co/ORkKZUnSFU https://t.co/SJrDS4bHTIThe Phoenix Suns' defense has made things challenging for the Dallas Mavericks in ways they did not encounter in their first-round matchup against the Utah Jazz. 

For @MavericksSI, I wrote about some key differences the Suns' defense presents:

Phoenix as an example. Book was drafted in 2015, but the Suns stayed bad long enough that it allowed them several swings at the lottery. They got Ayton, Bridges and Cam Johnson as lottery guys. Dallas made the playoffs Luka’s 2nd year@Suns Happy Birthday CP!!!@Ludog_34 @NBA @Suns @DevinBook Bro that’s KAT@Suns LMBO this fool works for them and says he makes money making bets, the bs is real with him.@KendrickPerkins Mr. Perkins, I love your calculations...Kyrie to Los Angeles...and as you suggested Anthony Davis to Brooklyn Nets... in place of Kyrie, is doable.

https://t.co/MHsLox2uUJ@NBA @CP3 @Suns Happy Birthday, @CP3!!🎉🎩🎉@NBA @CP3 @Suns Happy BirthdayThere was a time when Dallas and Phoenix both stunted those types of players the same way.  Derrick Jones Jr and Davon Reed in particular come to mind for the Suns, and Justin Anderson, Isaiah Roby, and even Jae Crowder back in the day do for Dallas.

And both teams sucked then.@Hoodio24 Phoenix suns@TheHoopCentral @Suns @sofiasunss “And book”😭😭😭@suns_tutu_fan @PHXMRORNG @mcuban @NBA @Suns @dallasmavs I’ll take a Sr Product Manager job 😂@gwiazdyB No way man suns winning tn..
