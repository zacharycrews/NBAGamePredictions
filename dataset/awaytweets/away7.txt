If John Wall is decently healthy and some of these young wings they have like Jalen Green, KPJ, and Jae'Sean Tate can make an impact, Christian Wood, Daniel Theis, Eric Gordon, and Dorenthal James Augustin are competent enough to get this team to 28@SportsMT @HoustonRockets @ktrhnews Congrats.The Celtics don‚Äôt have nearly as big of a following as the Houston Rockets do. No China elements. No superstar players (one can argue that Jayson Tatum is I guess).
