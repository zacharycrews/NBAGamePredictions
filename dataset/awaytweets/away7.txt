No https://t.co/lxaaduIXHn@chicagobulls Oh so we losing tonightAt this point, all we can do is speculate wildly about the future of Zach LaVine and the Chicago Bulls. As I understand it, LaVine will never play basketball ever again, and the Chicago Fire Department has started a controlled burn at the UC, with plans to salt the ground after.@chicagobulls Day damn 1!🤦🏿‍♂️@chicagobulls This sucks, as a heat fan I at least want to watch a good gameWonder if the @NBA still thinks Oklahoma City is still a better market than #Seattle?

https://t.co/xEf1Kb1WnT https://t.co/IpXlKx6rltBest of luck to the Chicago Bulls. Quick fave memory:  hearing my first swear word at the Bulls/Bucks game in 1986 at the old Chicago Stadium w/ Josh Felman &amp; our dads. Bucks fans behind us, pissed at Michael Jordan destroying them started chanting "Bull S#!*! Bull S#!*!" https://t.co/Ytw4c4W3LM@chicagobulls It's a lingering issue, That will never go away unfortunately!@lettalksport Chicago Bulls@chicagobulls Hard to stay a Bulls fan.  Always something fishy going on.CHICAGO BULLS - this will be a year predicated on if names such as DeRozan and LaVine can continue their ascent with their bench.

Get tickets to tonight’s @chicagobulls SEASON OPENER and Zach LaVine is out for “knee management”…

Gotta love Chicago sports. How you miss the damn opener after no designated injuries all week is beyond me. 😒@chicagobulls 🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️wtf everybody injured now huh@chicagobulls Our season is HERE. Let the games begin! https://t.co/v0p3gDF5ZH@ZachLaVine finessed y’all. @chicagobullsGotta manage that Game 1 workload. @chicagobulls https://t.co/crElgjprVa@zaidhasports @chicagobulls @Plus500 lol that looks disgusting hahahaEither Pat scores 20 tonight or i change my stance to 35 wins @chicagobullsI want a refund! 
Zach lavine is out tonight for the season opener with load management? Wtf @chicagobulls@MrDelicious13 You stop that right now! We all know the Chicago Bulls way is to avoid the luxury tax and rely on injuries as a scape goat. Injuries are an integral part of the plan!The Chicago Bulls giving off Chicago White Sox vibes early.Chicago Bulls snap back and a Derrick Rose away jersey used to have people in a chokehold from 2011-2014 https://t.co/k7crheZIUD@ctsbulls @chicagobulls @670TheScore @Audacy This guy is a joke…. Always hurtShout out to Chicago sports for always making me sick to my stomach. You all are the best at being the absolute worst. @ChicagoBears @chicagobulls @Cubs#Bulls are gonna have a 2022 Chicago #WhiteSox type of season aren’t they? 
Hopefully Zach gets better. Go bulls. 🐂❤️ https://t.co/yjH4aGI4VJSo, who’s lying here? The Chicago Bulls? Zach LaVine? 

No chance if there wasn’t a real issue that’d he’d be missing tonight’s game. 

If the season is going to be like this, ship em all out and call it a day.

This may be an overreaction, but this is seriously mind boggling.@NOBUJORDAN @Bullskickass @chicagobulls Bruh that is insane thank you sm ❤️@chicagobulls No we not@chicagobulls @ZachLaVine either there’s continuing issues with the knee or you are a max contract player talking about sitting the first two games of the season to “manage” an injury that doesnt exist after a 10-day rest period.

Which is it? https://t.co/uSRbRVyIf5The Chicago Bulls backcourt🤧🤧#9 Chicago

Sky and Bulls have absolutely nothing to do with one another. I guess maybe bulls look at the sky sometimes? 

do the names need to go together? absolutely not. maybe it’s better when they don’t! but not for the purposes of these rankings.

#BetOnIt@chicagobulls @ZachLaVine Get well soon..@Anthonysmdoyle Well to be fair, even though they offered Caruso less than Chicago, his contract amount plus the additional luxury tax was greater than the Bulls offer. Caruso wasn't going to actually get that money, but they were hoping that would resonate with him.@Maria501161 @rdpapa123 You do realize him having a bulls hat probably has nothing to do with her. He filmed in Chicago for 11 years. Plus my family was huge bulls fans growing up bc of Michael Jordan and we live in Ohio and never been to Chicago. We even had bulls hats.@ScooterMagruder My Chicago Bulls claim 5th or 6th seed.Can’t wait to watch my Chicago Bulls tomorrow@chicagobulls @patricklw4 Unfair! How about you earn the job. It would serve Williams and the team as a whole more to have some competition. Patrick looked great in the final preseason game but I would argue that Green wanted the job more.
