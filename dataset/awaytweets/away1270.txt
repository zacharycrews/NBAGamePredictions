#NBAPlayoffs #NBAonTNT¬† #NBA #GamblingTwitter #NBATwitterI need to apologize to someone though... 

The person I need to apologize to is Joe Johnson. 

I called this man a ski-mask all-star for robbing the Atlanta Hawks with a max deal. 

But you know something? Joe Johnson showed up to work. And many nights he put in the work.@Boards2Buckets @MiamiHEAT @ATLHawks @Timberwolves @memgrizz @DisneyAlexMax TS: Ravnos

Last year Mavs fans were bugging out looking at ATL successful run to ECF. MAVS fans wanted better players. I think Hawks are dealing with too many health issues@putemupcdukes @NBA @ATLHawks I think it's comparable. John Collins being hurt doesn't help. Capella being hurt doesn't help. Just saying no 1b behind Luka either. Mavs playing incredible defense though@ATLHawks Your teams sucks, rebuild around Kevin Knox@jimponds @NBA @ATLHawks You're saying the Hawks roster is better?The Heat can close out the series vs the @ATLHawks tonight, while the @memgrizz and the @Suns aim to regain series lead vs @Timberwolves and @PelicansNBA, respectively

Trae Young is a great player and he will continue to help the Hawks win games.@putemupcdukes @NBA @ATLHawks I believe it‚Äôs because of our pick and roll game not being there.

#mffl #dALLasIN@MikeBellATL @TheTraeYoung @ATLHawks Hawks need a Vince Carter on the floor and try to trade for karl Anthony Towns.

It‚Äôs a combination of the team not moving the ball, standing around, not playing defense, committing stupid fouls on 3 point shots, heat getting too many points in the paint. Bad matchup all around.@ATLHawks we need to go get rudy@peacock_coach @MikeBellATL @TheTraeYoung @ATLHawks I‚Äôm not giving him a pass but look at other great teams. They have more than just one true star. Usually at least 2 or 3. It‚Äôs just the truth. Hawks need a true leader on the floor that don‚Äôt mind holding players accountable for not doing their job.@peacock_coach @raleigh_dawg3 @MikeBellATL @TheTraeYoung @ATLHawks Why? Put Trae on any team like the Knicks, Charlotte, even Miami. Those teams would be so much better with him playing point. You keep Trae and go get stars that can go get their own buckets. We have too many ‚Äúnice‚Äù players but not stars.@Subbi232 Pretty much the Atlanta Hawks from 2007-2017.@MikeBellATL @TheTraeYoung @ATLHawks The Heat make defense a priority where as the Hawks just hit and miss at it. Hawks need another STAR who can go get buckets when Trae is being double teamed and can‚Äôt drive the lane.

Welcome to the A, my boy üíØ@gallinari8888 @ATLHawks you not lebron üíÄ@VChandler10 @ATLHawks We still can though highly unlikely. One never knows üëèü§£ü§ô@t8dav @putemupcdukes @ATLHawks Completely disagree. Is he Lebron and can take an average team to the finals? No. But he‚Äôs definitely the guy to build around. Heat are literally all in on Trae, and asking the other 4 guys to beat them. They can‚Äôt.@ATLHawks As I watch the playoffs I see most other teams play with a toughness and their younger players making significant contributions. Wish we could do the same. I've never seen an NBA redshirt season until now.@sportsgrill @MiamiHEAT @ATLHawks Heat 127 hawks 117@2chainz @ATLHawks How u hold the ball was lit, ‚úîÔ∏èthat‚Äôs why u balling lit too ‚≠êÔ∏è

To show &amp; spread some Love https://t.co/7rRDPcVHjtI‚Äôm not proposing any @atlhawks trades the season not over !! Can they win in Miami ?? Yeah , they have no choice but to keep playing  if they want to keep season going . Hawks usually play well when back against the wall . Depends on what mood they in !!@raleigh_dawg3 @MikeBellATL @TheTraeYoung @ATLHawks SGA has been on one of the worst teams in the league, that was been tanking for 3 years. He has a positive winning percentage. And he plays both ways. The argument is Trae is so flawed on D that it crushes this team. It can't be ignored, and he shouldn't be untouchable.we pulled up to the  @ATLHawks game last night ‚Ä¶.

The @ATLHawks coaches seem clueless. But also the players. Paid professionals.@babyjocko @_HighlyFavored2 @RoRazzi @ATLHawks Trae's timing with horrible shot selection and over dribbling the shot clock away don't help either.I gotta say - tonight‚Äôs performance from @BenSimmons25 is better than his previous playoff performance against the @ATLHawks. #BenSimmons #BrooklynNets@babyjocko @_HighlyFavored2 @RoRazzi @ATLHawks have little to no offensive or defensive basketball IQ. It's like they plan on hopes and dreams. It's frustrating because it's obvious stuff they miss. I blame the players &amp; coaches. No excuse a team should beat you the exact same way 3 times.@sportsgrill @MiamiHEAT @ATLHawks Heat 115 Hawks 96@Kam7810 @ATLHawks @StateFarmArena And the hawsuks are getting exposed@Cavs_House @ATLHawks @StateFarmArena But you‚Äôre not in the playoffs correct?Earning gift cards for selling my stuff on @Listia!
