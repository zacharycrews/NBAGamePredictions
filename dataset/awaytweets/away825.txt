1u Miami Heat -3.5 (-110)

MIA been on a roll recently as well NO, they’ve covered in 5 straight and I think that ends tonight. Integrating CJ who will have a big role is going to take time. Heat defense is going to cause them fits

Let’s get the first one 🔥 🍻his team in the playoffs. They were in the Orlando Bubble where they had one of the hardest playoffs of all time and made the NBA Finals, where they faced his former team, the Miami Heat. After a 6 game series he won his 4th and most recent Mickey Mouse ring.
James is an amazingFinals and won 2 of them. In those years with Miami he got 2 NBA MVPs and 2 Finals MVPs. In 2014 LeBum left the Heat to go back to the Cavs. During his time there he went to the Finals 4 times, all vs the Golden State Warriors, and in 2016 he led his team back from a 3-1 deficitand just a few season later, in 2009, he got his first MVP award. After that season in 2010 he was a free agent and left Cleveland to go to the Miami Heat. In that team he was part of “The Big 3” including Dwayne Wade and Chris Bosh. During his time in Miami he went to 4 straightBlack History Month essay for school. 
Lebron Raymone James Sr is a professional basketball player in the NBA. He is currently playing for the Los Angeles Lakers but he has played for the Miami Heat and Cleveland Cavilers (twice) in the past.MIAMI HEAT ML 5u

Now this. Miami starts the day in 1st and rated 2nd best odds to win east. Finishes the day possibly as low as 5th and vegas has them with 4th best odds. Wtf. They wasted another year of butler's prime#NBA In hindsight, the Lebron Miami Heat are a bit of a minor miracle. Between injuries and team chemistry, it's so easy for Super Teams to go off the rails. They have so much salary and talent focused on so few players that they don't have the depth to adapt.Ben Simmons will be with the Brooklyn Nets when they face the Miami Heat on Saturday Night.

The only other team with a prayer is Mil who lost PJ Tucker to Miami who was pivotal to their championship season

BKN has the talent but do you believe they can put it all together with 30 games left in a season?

Would ❤️ for @MiamiHEAT to sign him!!People keep forgetting, Miami Heat became the number one team in the east playing Caleb Martin, Max Strus, Gabe Vincent and Omer Yurtseven big minutes while the stars were out. And now, you add a healhty Bam, Jimmy, Victor Oladipo and Morris to that lineup? Thats a win.@besttakess @MiamiHEAT @MiamiHEATstore Oh look! The same dude from that “owners of heat twitter” group chat 💀All these trades to make their team "better". Miami Heat, we add VICTOR OLADIPO to the #1 tem in the East in exchange for...

NOTHING!!

In my eyes, this is the best move of the trading deadline. 💪🏽👌🏽

Why trade the guys who literally dominated the league when our start were out?all these trades only to lose to the @MiamiHEAT #heatnation https://t.co/G1UcgQxX8xLakers didn’t make a trade SMHHH!!!! Wassup big head @MiamiHEAT@TheHoopCentral The Miami Heat 🔥❤️Between the Sixers and the Nets, I will be holding out hope for the Miami Heat this year. Knock both of these Eastern Conference squads out of here. 

(Sorry Bulls fans, I'm a Piston fan. Can't remotely come close to cheering you on)At the deadline houston sent Victor Oladipo to the Heat for Kelly Olynyk, and a 2022 frp.

At the time this trade looked like an easy fleece for Miami, but Dipo has barely played and Olynyk had a good stint with the rockets.

Will have to see how oladipo plays when he returns https://t.co/FeSyQZ2zJc1/28/22: Miami HEAT vs L.A. Clippers; B. Adebayo Offensive Reb Putback to L. Kennard 3 https://t.co/F6yV6gTsID via @YouTubeEnd of season standings now (after play in).

I’ve waited 9 years to see this (Fingers crossed). I’d be ecstatic for even a 70% version of Oladipo as long as health permits.

Cause I’m a fan and choose to believe lolMiami Heat are the best team in the East following the trade deadline https://t.co/HHX2BXzv1ZGuys you won’t believe it…the Miami Heat are the #1 Seed in the Eastern Conference.@TheHoopCentral The Miami Heat@TheHoopCentral the Miami Heat@TheHoopCentral the miami heatNo Deals for Miami Heat Source tells EspnAfter This Deadline I Got Miami Heat Winning The Championship This Year…The Miami Heat not making a move confirms my belief that 2022 playoffs with determine 2022 offseason for us. If Herro, Duncan, Dipo, Lowry and other pieces do not push the Heat over the top and win in a stacked East...expect the Heat to send a package with FRPs for a star.@HunnSaelee @MiamiHEAT Y’all got one of the best bench lol and Olidipo ain’t come back yet.James harden
James brown 
James earol jones 
Idgaf Miami in 4. @MiamiHEATAll of that to still lose to @MiamiHEAT 🥱🤣 https://t.co/0UxzLhLdXQ@BallySportsNO @PelicansNBA @MiamiHEAT tell ya friends!!1. the Miami Heat are still a very good team.

2. They can finish anywhere from 1 to 6 in the seedings.

3. This team is built to make a deep run, but the East is so stacked. So Jimmy, Bam, Tyler, Lowry, etc... will have to be consistent.

Going to be interesting.

#HEATCultureAll these trades just to lose to the Miami Heat in 5 💅Lots of trades today… @MiamiHEAT in 6 vs anybody@MiamiHEAT sign @Michael8easleyBam Adebayo and Gabe Vincent forming quite the bond.

Best team in the East is apparently not the best team in the East. #HEATCultureI’m happy for the sixers just don’t play the @MiamiHEAT and ya should be goodANNOUNCE @Goran_Dragic @MiamiHEAT 🐉🐉🐉@MiamiHeat_Fra Dragic en buy out ? 😏Will bring this back since we didn’t make a move today @MiamiHEAT https://t.co/OYRthygpr2The Heat have 13 players under contract and have two weeks under NBA rules before they have to fill the 14th. That spot is expected to go to Caleb Martin. Miami may also be a factor on the buyout market.@LongMasterWolf @Swarlayzers we straight up could've been given the entire miami heat roster for dragic and they'd be screaming like "why not the lakers roster???"@HeatvsHaters Why would they go to the regimented Miami Heat over the bucks, improved nets, and improved 6ers.No other trades for the Miami Heat. Electing to stand pat. Freeing up that 2022 and 2023 1st round pick though with the KZ Okpala deal. Pat Riley already cooking up an offseason deal for another star. That dude is a menace. https://t.co/hnsQ46bp1iKendrick Perkins on NBA Today on who’s the best team in the East now: 

“I don’t wanna knockout the Miami Heat but I’m going with the Sixers” 

The biggest flip flopper 😒😒@MiamiHEAT you just ruined my day. thank you. i haven’t slept in 72hrs, crying and screaming because you didn’t want to make a move. you don’t love me like you say you do. i hope you’re happy.It was frantic
It was unscripted
It was fun!

Catch up on all the reaction here or at Miami Heat UK TV on YouTube 👊 https://t.co/Id6QQA0mzh@Frescobar777 @MiamiHEAT Sixers, nets, Milwaukee... who just added a needed player who gives them more front court depth... do I have to spell it for you buddy? We need to trade to get someone who can back up PJ tucker at the 4... at this rate he will be gassed by the postszn. Think some talk less kid.Love u @MiamiHEAT don’t listen to the cowards@adamiami_ @MiamiHEAT I’ll take current healthy roster Heat over any team on the East. Especially any team that just made a trade and only has half a season to get to know how to play with new guys. Stop trying to break apart a good thingDon’t see the reasoning to pressure Miami Heat to make a trade. Think of Oladipo as our deadline acquisition, help is coming everybody.@DownBadForDevin @MiamiHEAT If anything we getting the scraps in buyout market 😭So it is confirmed. @MiamiHEAT going to the buyout market! We could potentially see a @Goran_Dragic comback with the Heat! https://t.co/MvYAC3mRPz@MiamiHEAT Everyone says we will have Olidipo back. But I don’t trust him. He’s injury prone. He played what a whole 4 games for us last year until season ending injury and in those 4 games he looked like shit. Not sure if he’s the answer for the help we needed for trade deadline.On to the Buyout market @MiamiHEAT@WrldofChris_ @MiamiHEAT you’re rightMa G yal better make sure Dipo and Morris are back soon ay @MiamiHEATThe Miami Heat confirm that they did not make a move todayVictor Oladipo is the Miami Heat's trade deadline acquisition. 

He could be the difference maker that takes this Heat team over the top.For the second straight year, the Miami Heat’s trade deadline acquisition has been Victor Oladipo.

Let’s ride. @hothothoops #HEATCulture https://t.co/b43IAJV4xCDragic o Schroder por favor @MiamiHEAT https://t.co/QXXAYiRrDN@correops7375 @MiamiHEAT Trade what 💀 we got Oladipo otw for free no trade required.

https://t.co/bNGBP14dAn@smitchell17 Dragic has been in Miami the whole time, just waiting to be traded and bought out so he could go back to yhe Heat.  Don’t know why anyone would speculate he’s going anywhere but home, haha.Some #nbabets #Propbets #GamblingTwitter  
I like today:

🏀Miami Heat -4.5
🏀Memphis Grizzlies -11
🏀Stephen Curry OVER 20 pts (alt points)
🏀Ziaire Williams OVER 9.5 pts
🏀Bam Adebayo Double Double/Miami Win
🏀Norman Powell UNDER 16.5 pts
🏀Giannis Antetokounmpo UNDER 29.5 pts@MiamiHEAT This ain’t what we got notifications on forHe’s going to Miami. He’s been there with his family this whole time waiting for a chance to be bought out by a team after they traded for him. Would be a great Bulls get but he already has a connection with the Heat https://t.co/DTCBxhViWlMilwaukee traded for Ibaka. Philly is in talks for Harden.

All this means to me is Heat fans are going to lose their mind if Miami doesn’t make a dealIt’s crazy how they was tryna call the Miami Heat “bubble frauds” when the Lakers really been hot ass ever sinceFor the ppl who wanna bring Dragic back… please tell  me how does he make this MIami Heat team better? 

Because Lowry and Dragic about the same age and Lowry better…

Gabe has improved and earned the right to be the backup PG

Stop pretending Lebron &amp; KD are the same! KD has won zero!the scary part about Goran Dragic getting traded:

he is now eligible to sign with the Miami Heat if he gets bought out.

that was only allowed if he got traded and THEN bought out.Rui Hachimura is being traded to the Miami Heat for Omer Yurtseven and draft compensation. Caleb Martin is also being brought up on a two way, per sources@TatumFan4Life @alexboswell576 @StoolGreenie Dragic is coming back to Miami 😂😂 he legit hasn’t left and still works out in heat gear at the team facilityWell then again Dragic would be an "upgrade" but he's not the same Dragic that was on the Heat that first season got in Miami.

My Miami Heat thoughts:

- Keep Duncan Robinson unless there’s a trade that truly makes the team better.

- A smaller trade feels more likely than a Robinson trade.

- It’s okay if they move forward with no moves. Sit back and have zero expectations.#NBA Trade Deadline is 3:00 PM ET today

Will Duncan Robinson be a member of the Miami Heat for tonight’s game in New Orleans?

MIA are 6-3 in there L9. This season with Jimmy, Bam and Lowry they are 12-6. They are 7-2 ATS with 2-3 days rest and 9-4 ATS with rest advantage. NOP have a 13-23 record against teams over 500, I expect it to take time for CJ to fit.

Basically they are open and don't mind being revealing@AaryanS19 The Miami Heat.@JamesGreenInUK There are teams out there, like the Miami Heat, who's front offices are pulling genius moves. Even getting restrictions removed from their future first rounders, and so far the Lakers have been sat on their hands. Something better be done todayMIAMI HEAT. WE ARE THE BEST TEAM IN THE EAST@PrinnzyC @hothothoops @MiamiHEAT Yeah. I doubt that Riley wants to mess with the chemistry and camaraderie the team has built but, if he does, my guess is that it will have to be a for a real good player that will be welcomed with open arms. Perhaps a player that guys like Jimmy Kyle and Bam are friends with.@Undefined003 @hothothoops @MiamiHEAT My hope is we don’t trade Duncan for just anyone has to be a big upgrade but i doubt he’s going anywhere, i know yurt trade value is very high should be interesting tomorrow@PrinnzyC @hothothoops @MiamiHEAT Yeah, we got 2 roster spots open, one which is expected to be used to convert Caleb, and the other is probably for a buyout player.

There's also a chance of a relatively big trade package involving Duncan + Yurtz + picks.@nicekicks @djkhaled @MiamiHEAT What did I just watch@NateHillShow @NBAHistory @MiamiHEAT The Nuggets are a poverty franchise, the fuck would you know about actual achievements@MiamiHEAT @DanielAlva85 Source: trust me broParty in the city where the heat is on

Hats off to him.@2strong2superio @DracoBuckets7 @LauraGNiculae @TheNBACentral @JakeLFischer @MiamiHEAT When was ur last chip??@MiamiHEAT So the trade within the trade is:
Heat give up 2 years(2023/24) of lottery protection on a Heat pick that OKC owns.  It's only protected in 2025 and then 2026 no protection. 
In exchange, Heat can now trade our 2023 pick. 
Heat can't suck 2024/25 season!@BillyReinhardt Not going to happen, Dragic has literally been seen at Heat games even though he's still technically a Raptor. There are pictures of him practicing with Victor Oladipo, Dragic is in love with Miami. If he gets bought out, no doubt in my mind he goes to the Heat.Bro are you saying this to a Miami heat fan? 😂 https://t.co/mImygCLpLs@Undefined003 @hothothoops @MiamiHEAT I respect it i heard things about Thad young and Paul milsap in the buy out@JCrossover it's LeBron's choice.. the culture same as Miami Heat big three, lets create a big four out of aging ringless hall of gamers.... thinking he can give a ring to his friendsSaying this to a Miami Heat fan is wild https://t.co/jhw7QY3wiT@PrinnzyC @hothothoops @MiamiHEAT He played pretty bad tonight, which should've been a game for him to showcase for the Heat.

Barely active, disinterested, bricking shots, turning it over, lazy defense.

The Heat fans who wanted him before tonight decided they didn't want him any longer.@Nets_Bets_10 @srog72 harden to heat a sneaky thought. we’ll see if miami has a full roster tomorrow. pels revenge game. we were +6.5 in miami and +4 at home. heat have struggled with teams with length. pels been switching 1-4 with excellent defense/rotations. should be a great game. grabbing the +410 away!

Barely get to watch my team out here on the West Coast.@AKBLJS @Raptors @Bucks @BrooklynNets @MiamiHEAT @sixers @Pacers Again, i could be wrong and I'm 100% willing to listen to experts and/or good reasoning.

I get that the East is a crapshoot - Milwaukee is the only thing close to a sure thing, but I don't see the Raps making a deep run just by adding Myles Turner.@AKBLJS @Raptors @Bucks @BrooklynNets @MiamiHEAT @sixers @Pacers I like Myles Turner a lot - but he's injured for at least another month and the Raps would only control him until next season.

Not sure the Raps are one player away from title contention [this year for sure]ALERT: New high roller bet posted!

LMFAOOOO what a casual.Not sure I like this trade that much for the @Raptors - they take on a LOT of salary for two guys that won't put them over the top vs. @Bucks  @BrooklynNets or even @MiamiHEAT &amp; @sixers 

@Pacers get a LOT of assets + cap space.

Have these people even seen Mann's filmography?This Heat trade set Miami in a very nice poison as they can add Caleb Martin on the roster and make a buyout move at a possible impact veteran like a Thad Young who if not traded can be on the market. #HEATCultureDown in Daytona like Miami heat@JimmysBurner5 @MiamiHEAT neither but I want PJ Washington@BAYCBlackList @opensea @BoredApeYC This one’s a big one boys.

Riley and Spo have a lot of impressive accolades. Tap on any of these pics to see the listNow that I’m no longer on the Los Angeles Clippers and a proud member of the Miami Heat I’ve decided to play victim and sell stories to the media about how @ruhikhan_ and @uEatCrayons cause locker room problems.Ok, this is why we don’t just trade for anyone @MiamiHEAT #HEATCulture https://t.co/yAWTCAZeD0@clarkpetion305 @MiamiHEAT It’s a tough time for them bro, let them mourn 😂😂 - Joel@HVTWpodcast @MiamiHEAT I think that was the point@stan_heat @Macgyver1312 @sell_dalton Lmao with mvps🤷🏾‍♂️

I wonder what miami doesnt have rn@MiamiHEAT Bullshit https://t.co/nyBfGSVQTB@JimmysBurner5 @DeanScorpion_ @TheHoopCentral @MiamiHEAT As a joke bro. Let’s be honest@AcunaPlusButler @DadeTeflonDon @MiamiHEAT one is in the playoff the other is in mid season meaningless game.@MikeDeliversPod I booked a trip to Miami weeks ago expecting the heat versus the nets Big 3. Smh 🤦🏻@maxigorilla2 @Nickheat3 @DeanScorpion_ @TheHoopCentral @MiamiHEAT He’ll definitely get more minutes to develop in OKC, I hope it works out lolCorrection: Heat are ~1.95M below the luxury tax. 

Thanks to @teixeiraluis92. Yurt’s cap hit is counted as a “2-year vet minimum” salary ($1,669,178) rather than his actual “1-year vet minimum” salary ($1,489,065) due to “tax variance” since Miami doesn’t own his draft rights. https://t.co/txrtj1VmFe@NBA @NBAonTNT @MiamiHEAT 
So the NETS get another primetime nationally televised game tomorrow after losing 9 straight and are complete ass! How about you move the games around and show an actual team like the Miami Heat? Bet that wont happen though.@EraGiannis @DadeTeflonDon @MiamiHEAT And KZ and Caleb Martin own yall so who really cared@MacMulholland1 @ZachLowe_NBA Because right now worst case scenario the heat pick will be in the 20s. By doing this they have a mich better chance of the heat starting a rebuild around bam and herro and getting a much better draft pick from Miami in 2025 or 2026.@MrRed024 @Bam_Adobobayo @MiamiHEAT Lmaooo@ztwhite23 @sixers @BrooklynNets @JHarden13 @Bucks @chicagobulls @MiamiHEAT Don’t count out @celtics@MiamiHEAT PJ Washington@NBA @NBAonTNT @MiamiHEAT 
So the NETS get another primetime nationally televised game tomorrow after losing 9 straight and are complete ass! How about you move the Games around and show an actual tram like the Miami Heat? Bet that wont happen though.As part of the trade, the Heat and Thunder agreed to amend the protections of the first-round pick that Miami already owed to Oklahoma City to a protected 2025 first-round selection that will turn into a 2026 unprotected pick if it’s not conveyed in 2025. https://t.co/uzhA67ScMJ@MiamiHEAT Dan went from hard drives to hardwood 🤣wakes up at 4 am just to practice half ass jumpers and troll in the clutch trade him @MiamiHEAT@Nolan51266499 @officialyasserr @GalacticSama @MiamiHEAT Imagine yall in 8th right now let that sink in we # 1I am watching closely if Washington sits at any point and comes back in for the Hornets during this game. If this deal has traction for the Miami Heat, last thing they need is for him to get hurt.@FaceGod37 @RussNRoses @tbl_lancewinnz The Knicks were very clearly an up and coming team before Pat got there. Same thing in Miami, he took over a Heat team that just won 59 games the season beforeBtw if y’all haven’t, make sure to follow @HVTWpodcast for dope Miami Heat content and more 🔥 https://t.co/vHtCrLl3V7@MiamiHEAT lol this team!!@7thGypsy @mounties777 ATLANTA BRAVES/MIAMI HEAT/LA CHARGERS@KacperCroft @evianwater @trulyseltzer @DUALIPA .@DUALIPA @MiamiPD @MiamiHEAT @MiamiHerald @NYPD EVEN @WhiteClaw IF YOU CAN GET US THERE WE’LL SWAP OUT TRULY@AcunaPlusButler @DadeTeflonDon @MiamiHEAT Bryn Forbes owns ya'll@QRich @MiamiHEAT @Bam1of1 @PlayersTribune I'm still amused how he got his nickname. 🙃
Thanks for sharing that with us. 😬💥🦵🏽
Play great ..and watch where you're going! ☺️@MiamiHEAT Much LOVE to KZ!!!Goran Dragic is staying in Miami and in the Heat facility as a member of the Raptors. I don't see why Joe can't stay around, maybe just not very openly. https://t.co/Ci8AxWasbWIdk why I give a fuck what the lakers are doing but honestly it's only because nobody scaring @MiamiHEAT in the east. Not one team even phases me. But in the west, golden state, phoenix, and if LA gets dame, then that's the only other team besides gs and phoenix that phases us.Hope @sixers trade for @BrooklynNets @JHarden13. It downgrades both teams. He’s a bad teammate and is too broken down to make a positive impact. If trade happens, it puts @Bucks, @chicagobulls, and @MiamiHEAT on top in East. #BullsNation #SeeRed #NBA #NBATradeDeadline #NBATwitter4. “In Miami with my mf heat ouuuuut” https://t.co/RAQDgB2vfn@MiamiHEAT Easy W 🧤GameThread: Miami Heat (34-20) @ Washington Wizards (24-28) https://t.co/CUGEh2kafk@MiamiHEAT Thank you Dan @LeBatardShow@MiamiHEAT @LettingItFly_ thank god@HVTWpodcast @MiamiHEAT I heard they may sign Thaddeus young if he gets buyout.new vid out now OKC THUNDER GET KZ OKPALA &amp; PICK FROM MIAMI HEAT | PORTLAND TRAILBLAZERS NEW ERA

@MiamiHEAT https://t.co/pVEiLcZoHT@giannisgotaring @NBAHistory @MiamiHEAT Wait till you find out the rosters that Kerr, Doc and Jackson have had.The heat are roughly 1 LeBron away from being the best team. Rumor has it LeBron wants to play with his son before he retires. As a heat fan I just want to put on the record that if LeBron comes back to Miami I would be happy for the heat to draft and sign Bronny.@HVTWpodcast @MiamiHEAT What they do wrong?@Jimmyjackdadoe @MiamiHEAT nah i was just kidding, i used to be a fan of his and hoped for the best but he’s been too disappointing for too long to keep putting development into if we are focusing on contending. We’ll need that roster spot for someone that could get minutes@ilykazagi @MiamiHEAT well he’s a terroristFriendly reminder that the Miami Heat are going down in the first round of the playoffs again #NBAonESPN@ssdanilovaz @NBAHistory @MiamiHEAT you needed a superteam, hushJalen Rose just picked us to come out the East @MiamiHEAT@Laober22 @MDYDemocrats @MiamiHEAT @GloriaEstefan @AARPFL @aarpsoflo @AARPC2CFL @AARPTampaBay @AARPTally @mrnick107 @WaltDisneyWorld @Disney @NikkiFried @RepValDemings Just wow.
