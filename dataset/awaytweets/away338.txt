Tell me what he has done except talking about nonsense? Nothing. Sorry about that. Watch this video and give me a reason why he started to care about human rights. For money, of course. The man supports Israel and asked us to shut up.@celtics Of course the game I go to he sits 😅@AnjelikaYakovl2 @sagforvet @TayaSuri @celtics @EnesFreedom I mean he’s pretty much saying most Americans talk outta their ass when it comes to not having freedom in America, considering he delt with problems with rights in his home country that were far worse. But still, he is ignorant to the problems that Americans face@cedricmaxwell81 Hi Cedric, how are you doing?  I like to ask you if you might be interested in coming on my Canadian weekly podcast Live With CDP and talk some @celtics basketball and your career in the @NBA and going from a player to in the media as a colour analyst?@sagforvet @TayaSuri @stellarct @celtics @EnesFreedom And this. https://t.co/rqc6BgnDMR@sagforvet @AnjelikaYakovl2 @stellarct @celtics @EnesFreedom I'm not speaking in Enes Kanter's house. How is that I'm not sympathy?  By the way, I didn't hear him complain about Turkey, I just see him complain about people and things that has nothing to do with him. Why should I show mercy to this?

https://t.co/gojKaJ9MNL@celtics Let's go 13-10 soon@PabloRiveraNc @celtics He has missed 59 games total in his entire career. That is over 87 percent attendance of reg season games. He really doesnt miss that much its just recency bias@drdavidsamadi If we don't do this at the border this is pure theater. Close down the border for illegal immigration so we can focus on helping the immigrants that do it legally. Like the Boston Celtics NBA player.@celtics Question though…did he even release it in time?

For a week or so, really. Hopefully he'll get stronger thoughh@sagforvet @AnjelikaYakovl2 @stellarct @celtics @EnesFreedom Politics should stay away from sports.

This is USA freedom!@sagforvet @stellarct @celtics @EnesFreedom Lebron in not coward. This Kanter is CIA propaganda puppet. He is making fame out of human rights issue.
