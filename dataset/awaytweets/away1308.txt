20‚òÜ Dallas Mavericks +6' (-110)The mavericks have 5 years to blow up that roster.

#GamblingTwitterAfter getting steamrolled in Game 1, the Dallas #Mavericks regroup and try to fight their way back into the Western Conference Finals series when meeting the Golden State #Warriors in Game 2

#MavsVsWarriors #GSWvsDAL #NBA #NBAConferenceFinals https://t.co/ONwGreTo8xIn game 1 Dallas was held to 36.0% shooting overall and 22.9% shooting from three-point territory. The Mavericks were outrebounded 51-35. #betting #bettingtwitter #bettingpicks #bettingodds #bettingsports #bettingtipster https://t.co/i08q7SjvVWAccording to our data Dallas is 26-9 ATS following a loss with a plus-6.6 ATS. The Maverick‚Äôs were embarrassed pretty bad game 1, they are bound to make adjustments and so the mob is taking Dallas +6.5. #DubNation #MFFL #GamblingTwitter #NBATwitterLive #NBAPlayoffs #NBATwitter https://t.co/JZpjolGaGXDallas Mavericks Team Total over 103.5 (-121) @BSSportsbook 

I‚Äôm not confident on how the game plays out as a whole. Could be 107-104 Mavs cover and the under is good or 126-108 and not cover and the over hits. I am confident in the Mavs scoring tonight. https://t.co/CzlxYGy26XNBA player prop bets, predictions today: Warriors vs. Mavericks Game 2 (New York Post)

https://t.co/LFtkTkLXjH8/ Do national experts expect a similar rout for the Mavericks in tonight's Game 2 to the one they experienced in the opening loss? Some at @NBAonTNT sense a Dallas rebound is coming. https://t.co/lCulpgvzzi3/ It's hard enough to win on the road in the playoffs, but Dallas is also facing the Warriors, who have made five NBA Finals appearances in the last 10 years. Columnist @TimCowlishaw reminds us of the challenge the Mavericks face. https://t.co/QPwaQHlglU2/ All was not well when the Mavericks lost Game 1 in a 112-87 blowout on the road Wednesday. That included Dallas' star point guard Luka Doncic, whose 20 points were well below his playoff average entering the series.

Red 4 and Red 5 have to stop the roller as its also a mismatch. That's what their defence is for.

We haven‚Äôt lost playoff game there, yet!@claymorespears @dallasmavs @NBAonTNT @theeagledallas Not always. The other way:

1) P5 sets a screen for Luka
2) Hopefully Wiggins goes under the screen as he normally does
3) Red P2 comes to help wiggins
4) P2 +/- P3 cut the baseline
5) Luka find 5 after a roll
6) 5 either kicks out to the corner 3 or passes to the cutter
7) Shot@TedH6 @MavsHoops77 @dallasmavs @NBAonTNT @theeagledallas Nah. Everytime the Mavs have lost a game by 20 or more points, they win the next game.

2) Luka has to shoot the 3 well enough to force Wiggins over the screen
