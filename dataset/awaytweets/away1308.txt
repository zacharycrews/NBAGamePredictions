20☆ Dallas Mavericks +6' (-110)The mavericks have 5 years to blow up that roster. It’s way better than the one lebron had in CLE first stint but they are spending way too much money on a team that is not championship caliber let alone playoff caliber without luka and I like the guys in Dallas.🏀20/05/22

Dallas Mavericks @ Golden State Warriors - Over 53 points in 3rdQ @ 10/11 (1 unit)

#GamblingTwitterAfter getting steamrolled in Game 1, the Dallas #Mavericks regroup and try to fight their way back into the Western Conference Finals series when meeting the Golden State #Warriors in Game 2

#MavsVsWarriors #GSWvsDAL #NBA #NBAConferenceFinals https://t.co/ONwGreTo8xIn game 1 Dallas was held to 36.0% shooting overall and 22.9% shooting from three-point territory. The Mavericks were outrebounded 51-35. #betting #bettingtwitter #bettingpicks #bettingodds #bettingsports #bettingtipster https://t.co/i08q7SjvVWAccording to our data Dallas is 26-9 ATS following a loss with a plus-6.6 ATS. The Maverick’s were embarrassed pretty bad game 1, they are bound to make adjustments and so the mob is taking Dallas +6.5. #DubNation #MFFL #GamblingTwitter #NBATwitterLive #NBAPlayoffs #NBATwitter https://t.co/JZpjolGaGXDallas Mavericks Team Total over 103.5 (-121) @BSSportsbook 

I’m not confident on how the game plays out as a whole. Could be 107-104 Mavs cover and the under is good or 126-108 and not cover and the over hits. I am confident in the Mavs scoring tonight. https://t.co/CzlxYGy26XNBA player prop bets, predictions today: Warriors vs. Mavericks Game 2 (New York Post)

https://t.co/LFtkTkLXjH8/ Do national experts expect a similar rout for the Mavericks in tonight's Game 2 to the one they experienced in the opening loss? Some at @NBAonTNT sense a Dallas rebound is coming. https://t.co/lCulpgvzzi3/ It's hard enough to win on the road in the playoffs, but Dallas is also facing the Warriors, who have made five NBA Finals appearances in the last 10 years. Columnist @TimCowlishaw reminds us of the challenge the Mavericks face. https://t.co/QPwaQHlglU2/ All was not well when the Mavericks lost Game 1 in a 112-87 blowout on the road Wednesday. That included Dallas' star point guard Luka Doncic, whose 20 points were well below his playoff average entering the series. How's he feeling now? https://t.co/GPp7cjCnAO1/🏀 In the @NBA tonight, the @dallasmavs look to even their Western Conference Finals series with the Golden State @Warriors.

Luka and Mavs are focused on winning the West after knocking out the 1st-seeded Suns. Do they have enough firepower to compete with the Dubs? 🎮

Pick the winner ➡️ https://t.co/N7Uo7jKfIb
#NBA #NBATwitter https://t.co/2v5DzodRDHThe Mavericks are 6.5-point underdogs ahead of Game 2. But if Dallas loses tonight they can take solace that it beat the Suns after going down 2-0.

So do they?

#WorldOfSport https://t.co/rfxskGKedJ@claymorespears @dallasmavs @NBAonTNT @theeagledallas As you can see, The roller has the option to pass to the cutter or if one of the corner guys stays, he kicks out to the corner 3. 

Red 4 and Red 5 have to stop the roller as its also a mismatch. That's what their defence is for. 

The Luka/Powell pick and roll game is key https://t.co/I1k5aGocZJ@galacticosrmfc @dallasmavs @NBAonTNT @theeagledallas i like those pussy they call them a fan and delete the message bozos15-year-old went missing after going to the bathroom at a Dallas Mavericks game. Her parents found her through sex trafficking ads on the internet. - TheBlaze https://t.co/zV0vVEzGBQ@Pawlalapet @MavsHoops77 @dallasmavs @NBAonTNT @theeagledallas That wasn’t vs us

Especially, not at Chase 

We haven’t lost playoff game there, yet!@claymorespears @dallasmavs @NBAonTNT @theeagledallas Not always. The other way:

1) P5 sets a screen for Luka
2) Hopefully Wiggins goes under the screen as he normally does
3) Red P2 comes to help wiggins
4) P2 +/- P3 cut the baseline
5) Luka find 5 after a roll
6) 5 either kicks out to the corner 3 or passes to the cutter
7) Shot@TedH6 @MavsHoops77 @dallasmavs @NBAonTNT @theeagledallas Nah. Everytime the Mavs have lost a game by 20 or more points, they win the next game.

1) We missed 32 open 3s by my count. If the Warriors are giving you the 3 ball then you have to continue taking them. They go under the screen always

2) Luka has to shoot the 3 well enough to force Wiggins over the screen

3) Transition D needs work

4) Limit turnovers@dallasmavs @NBAonTNT @theeagledallas Please show upThis mic'd up clip of Dallas Mavericks head coach Jason Kidd instructing his team's defense has generated 4.4 million views on Twitter, ranking as the NBA's most-viewed Twitter video of the Playoffs and third-most viewed Twitter video of the entire season.
