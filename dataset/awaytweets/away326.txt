Lakers fans were super loud during a second half in which LAL held Sacramento to just 33 points to run away with the road win and get back over .500 on the season.LA Lakers swim past Sacramento Kings 117-92 Anthony Davis 25points 7rebounds 3assists.Sacramento Kings thought they were Gods from another World by beating Los Angeles Lakers in triple overtime. They tried to punish Lebron James.

Tonight, the Kings lost to the Lakers, without Lebron James playing.

Be careful when you talk about one of greatest players in the NBAYou just got punked like the bitch you are on your own home court. Disgraceful @SacramentoKings@Lakers defeat @SacramentoKings by a 25 point lead #LAKERSWIN #LakersShow

The Lakers improve to 12-11 and 5-7 without LeBron James. LA outscored Sacramento 67-33 in the second half. This is the Lakers' largest margin of victory this season -- and just their third double-digit win.

Up next: vs. the Clippers on Friday.Who you gonna fire now?
@SacramentoKingsThe Lakers outscore the Kings 67-31 in the second-half to win 117-92 on the road in Sacramento. Anthony Davis led the way with 25 PTS and 7 REB. Russell Westbrook finishes with 23-5-6.

The Lakers bench outscored that of the Kings 58-20.Why do bad things (losing) happen to good people (the Sacramento Kings)Ugly loss makes me siiick @SacramentoKings#sacramentokings @ Golden 1 Center https://t.co/bmhlFIEfZZIf the #DreamTeam from the 1992 Olympics played for the @SacramentoKings , in their prime, they'd still only get 30 winsSacramento Kings fans deserve better.@Michael98770048 @tailorgang1984 @SacramentoKings Didnt want to draft Luka because they had Fox then proceed to draft Haliburton and Davion.

I hate it hereSorry but a team with Anthony Davis-Russell Westbrook-Carmelo Anthony-Dwight Howard shouldn't need Lebron James to beat 8-13 @SacramentoKings team whose arguably best or 2nd best player @hbarnes isn't even playing.

I was watching a b ball tourney on tv right after the pandemic started and saw quality basketball with undrafted players and former collegiate's. They all had great form but so many misses. To watch this makes me realize how much God given talent they have@Matt_Barnes22 @SacramentoKings @Lakers The lakers are being so passive‚Ä¶ they need to attack the paint.. Westbrook needs to play above the rim.. stop throwing silly lobs all the time and forcing the ball inside when the defense clearly collapses on AD‚Ä¶ and work Melo into the game move on offense and guard the 3!@WestGoat @NBA @Lakers @SacramentoKings Hahahaha flakers fans said he was the secret weapon a few weeks ago@Matt_Barnes22 @SacramentoKings @Lakers I love you so much!!! You‚Äôre one of my favourite players ever!
