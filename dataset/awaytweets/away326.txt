The Kings are an embarrassment. Fox is averaging 5 to 6 Turnovers a game, Tyrese can't score, Buddy???
So what happens now? What does one do with a below-average, underperforming, overpaid, nonchalant, leadership-less team?We are gonna play a pissed off Kings team from their loss last night to the Lakers. Seems like the Clippers are very overconfident to beat Sacramento without their star player but ok they better win and they better beat the Lakers since it seems they want PG to sit tonight@Jumpshot8 @ShannonSharpe @undisputed @Lakers @SacramentoKings @warriors @Suns It's cause they spent all off season crowning the Lakers as the 2022 NBA champions and don't want to admit they were wrong. They'd rather double down and continue to spread the narrative that they can make a comeback, but will quickly shoot down the Suns even being in the WCF 😒Happy game day #ClipperNation!

https://t.co/LVnvIpFYJH️@chrissmith Checking the league schedule, I guess ESPN couldn't stomach the Sacramento Kings for one night, even if they are playing the Lakers.

Thank you, Coach, for acknowledging what we are all feeling. @SacramentoKings @CarmichaelDave https://t.co/53FGSM778T@_JasonLT The NBA ranked the Sacramento Kings the worst defense in the NBA, they haven’t improved much so this was the perfect team to play if you don’t have Lebron.Since their 5-4 start, the Sacramento Kings:

James is vaccinated for COVID and it is unclear if he tested positive for the virus. https://t.co/WgRqBoZgVVWhat do the @SacramentoKings do during halftime?

If only they drafted Luka...@SacramentoKings @Rich_Holmes22 Pitiful fucking franchise, something has to changeThe LAKERS will finish November 8-8 after a comeback from 14 points down on the road in Sacramento. LAKERS 117 Kings 92 as the LAKERS out score the Kings 67-33 in the 2nd half. Anthony Davis had 25 points, Russell Westbrook added 23 points and Malik Monk with 22 points in the winNo triple-overtime needed. The Los Angeles Lakers walked into Golden 1 Center and embarrassed the Sacramento Kings Tuesday night by a final of 117-92. It was a pathetic showing by a Kings team that has now been blown out in back-to-back games. Here are six quick thoughts.@SacramentoKings @Rich_Holmes22 i just feel bad for our team man, first 2 quarters were full of having fun and playin good then we just suck ass#NBA | FT:

Including the game  commentators. A Robitussin joke when Holmes turned his ankle? Sad.@MarcosBreton @SacramentoKings The quickest way to turn a franchise around is for the fans to stay home...
Owners hate an empty arenaLeBron James is put into NBA isolation after 'testing positive' for COVID: Lakers star won't play against Sacramento Kings tonight

And he is fully vaccinated, this whole thing is fucked up.  https://t.co/Vf9lxQOMv2We suck @SacramentoKingsSacramento kings are so useless i hate this team@j_biegler @SacramentoKings @Vivek @joshhigh66 Nah walton is probably the worst coach in the league. Gentry ain’t that good either lol but these players aren’t good together and stop trying half the time. And idk wtf it up with fox and HaliburtonTypical @SacramentoKings !!! Not even surprisedMe watching that second half trash the @SacramentoKings  put out.

#TheyDontWantIt https://t.co/x6iO1f0H3QFinal: Lakers 117, Kings 92.

Lakers fans were super loud during a second half in which LAL held Sacramento to just 33 points to run away with the road win and get back over .500 on the season.LA Lakers swim past Sacramento Kings 117-92 Anthony Davis 25points 7rebounds 3assists.Sacramento Kings thought they were Gods from another World by beating Los Angeles Lakers in triple overtime. They tried to punish Lebron James.

Tonight, the Kings lost to the Lakers, without Lebron James playing.

Be careful when you talk about one of greatest players in the NBAYou just got punked like the bitch you are on your own home court. Disgraceful @SacramentoKings@Lakers defeat @SacramentoKings by a 25 point lead #LAKERSWIN #LakersShow 

@KingJames has said it finalMovie starts on the side lines. Musicians. All spoiled rotten with World star basketball players. And the Sacramento kings still had you shaking in your boots lmao.@stillwhohei @SacramentoKings @Rich_Holmes22 @Chimezie_Metu Nothing but pain…@SacramentoKings  fucking suck.. no ♥️… how embarrassing..@SacramentoKings THEY DIDNT POST THE FINAL SCORE LMAOBig W for the @Suns! 🔥

Haven’t lost a game since October 27 against @SacramentoKings with Harrison Barnes’ game winner. Fans stayed patient with a 1-3 record and haven’t looked back since. https://t.co/cSmL6d11nNThe Lakers who lost at home to the Kings last Friday in 3 overtimes (as LeBron missed TWO game-winners) just won the second half at Sacramento 67-33 without LeBron. Hmmm.@SacramentoKings send the loss tweet@Raidernugg209 @SacramentoKings All bad brosacramento kings' fans are so extreme 😂 chill and suffer it's not so bad man, enjoy the hoops@SacramentoKings @vivek y’all are embarrassing@SacramentoKings postgame show starts &amp; all you see are @Lakers jerseysIf @Vivek is angry that @SacramentoKings fans have left the arena and it has been taken over by Lakers fans he has no one to blame but himself for this mess of an organization.Pathetic and embarrassing, even for the @SacramentoKings.  Off to cancel single team pass because I’d rather have $18 than watch these horrible games.@MarcosBreton @SacramentoKings Demand Vivek to sell.

My god this team.Final: Lakers 117, Kings 92

The Lakers improve to 12-11 and 5-7 without LeBron James. LA outscored Sacramento 67-33 in the second half. This is the Lakers' largest margin of victory this season -- and just their third double-digit win.

Up next: vs. the Clippers on Friday.Who you gonna fire now?
@SacramentoKingsThe Lakers outscore the Kings 67-31 in the second-half to win 117-92 on the road in Sacramento. Anthony Davis led the way with 25 PTS and 7 REB. Russell Westbrook finishes with 23-5-6.

The Lakers bench outscored that of the Kings 58-20.Why do bad things (losing) happen to good people (the Sacramento Kings)Ugly loss makes me siiick @SacramentoKings#sacramentokings @ Golden 1 Center https://t.co/bmhlFIEfZZIf the #DreamTeam from the 1992 Olympics played for the @SacramentoKings , in their prime, they'd still only get 30 winsSacramento Kings fans deserve better.@Michael98770048 @tailorgang1984 @SacramentoKings Didnt want to draft Luka because they had Fox then proceed to draft Haliburton and Davion. Braindead franchiseE'Aaron Fox ain't got no D! #tradefox @mmcnair @SacramentoKingsPathetic but so predictable.
@SacramentoKingsAlways nice to beat the Sacramento Kings in Sacramento.
😌@SacramentoKings take the franchise to Seattle.This doesn't look like a player worth a max contract. Our "best player" has zero heart, accountability and leadership skills.
Disgusting hearing all these Laker fans in our building.
@SacramentoKings @Vivek @mmcnair https://t.co/gXzF9gm05j@SacramentoKings where’s that same energy from Friday?I really wanted to renew my season tickets, but this is just too much to take.

Just pack up in the dead of night, the way the Baltimore Colts snuck out of town.@SacramentoKings take the Kings out of your team nameTime to hit the reset button  @SacramentoKings@SacramentoKings year in and out I experience being apart of the shittiest franchise of the NbBALet's go Lakers chants roaring in Sacramento. Man, can you believe the Kings haven't made the playoffs since 2007. They're practically the Mariners of the NBA. #LakeShow@SacramentoKings ya'll are false kings, Lebron is the real king smdh@Michael98770048 @SacramentoKings Fox is hot garbage@Matt_Barnes22 @SacramentoKings @Lakers Love to see itLoud Lakers chants in Sacramento.

LolIs Fox trying to lose a game on purpose??? 7 turnovers! What is wrong with him this season?  #sacramentokings@ElkGroveNews @SacramentoKings Kings games are so much fun but I can imagine it’s entirely different now with Covid.@SacramentoKings I think this is the worst kings team I have seen yet@Matt_Barnes22 @SacramentoKings @Lakers Lakers showed more energy and effort the second half!@danieltyree @SacramentoKings I mean all of my teams apply@tailorgang1984 @SacramentoKings The spacing is awful. Haliburton and fox don’t play good together. I would trade fox obviously. He’s good but not going to win anything alone. Mitchell also plays too much. It’s like they went out and drafted a black jimmer.@toffhibee By “sports,” do you mean the @SacramentoKings ? They only loosely fit the term.@Logan96979691 @SacramentoKings @Rich_Holmes22 @Chimezie_Metu true but let's not act like qw had the game to 11 just now and fox came in and turned the ball over 2 times and missed an elbow jumper that he created space for... poor shooting in the second half i think we missed 20 straight fg attemptsI feel genuinely bad for Sacramento Kings fans.Even though the @SacramentoKings have effectively lost with about 3 minutes to go - they just gave up - these behind-the-backboard seats are consistently empty. https://t.co/sgPQDfImaQI'm done watching this tonight. The Sacramento Kings other than Richaun Holmes have zero heart. Not worth investing my time and money into the product if the players don't care. Blow it the fuck up!!!
Not #SacramentoProudThat overwhelming sound that you hear is one of two things:

1. The large quantity of Lakers fans in attendance at Golden 1 Center cheering as their team pummels the Kings
2. The rest of the NBA laughing at Sacramento's expense@SacramentoKings are losing because they have a stupid coach.Tale of Two Halves … Basketball is a game of runs &amp; the @SacramentoKings weren’t ready when the @Lakers made a run in the second half.. Lakers have out scored the Kings 55-27 in the second half 🤦🏽‍♂️Kings 6/26 from distance tonight.

#SacramentoKings@momoragan The @SacramentoKings have been pushing shots and second guessing good looks. Plus not sharing. Team needs to wake up or walk off floor.Hearing the handful of kings fans ringing the cow bell at the Sacramento Kings home court is just really sad now, but I get it.  Trying to recapture that long lost magic of those late 90’s/ early 2000 teams. #LakeShow #lakersLmao yall stink @SacramentoKingsIt makes no sense and yet happens way too often. Sacramento goes away from what works and settles for iso sets &amp; chucking threes.

The LAKERS would finish the quarter on a 35-8 scoring run as well. Anthony Davis with 23 points and Malik Monk is a game high +/- of +19 as he has 15 points.@SacramentoKings Joke franchise.
