Forecast: €31.91@ederref @RonaldfreakinD @MarionTiger @HoustonRockets Edereff is correct. This is legal in NBA. Here is where dribble ends. Right foot down. Left foot slightly off floor so right is gather step. Next foot down(left) becomes pivot. By rule you can lift your pivot(which he did here) as long as you shoot/pass before it hits floor.1986 NBA Finals | Game 6 | Houston Rockets @Boston Celtics | Boston Garden https://t.co/Bmv7ste7ZE via @YouTube@TslaSteve @brags_08 @JyotiGondek In Houston they would be what… 6th in line of draw?

 I'm not sure why the Clips think Wall would be an upgrade, though. https://t.co/2hPTenQ7Ku@sportsfan_ian Right... but still need to work out a deal to play/move there. Doesn't Houston Rockets owner want his own team? So is Murray selling the team to this owner, is NHL BoG allowing this (again, unsure but needs 2/3 vote in favor).

I read about Wall being considered by the Clippers for trade. Their fans are excited about it as they spreading the news. Luke Kennard is one of the players being considered in the trade talks.No joke, I saw "A. Brooks" in the Houston Rockets box score the other night, and my first instinct was, 
"Oh damn, COVID in the league has gotten so bad that they brought Aaron Brooks back!"

It was Armoni Brooks... https://t.co/0Z5Gg3fNZG@rocktredblood @MorpheusDeZion @d2derrick @wash77033 @cdhthegreat @abbyeddymom @mikecanjerk @SammyDpsi @coletrain_tnt @johnnyoplaya64 @IamWendums @RocketSilasEra @SportsDean @RicknSugarLand @HoustonRockets We probably shouldn't be in a rush to trade off those guys, I'd say.
