Wilson has resigned with the Toronto Raptors on a 10-day contract.

Wilson has starred in the G League thus far. And frankly, there’s no one more deserving of a second chance than him.

Robert Woodard II is expected to assume a larger role for OKC. https://t.co/smnV0NA46n@_JasonLT THT was hurt the most by Russell Westbrook’s arrival. THT caught the Toronto Raptors eye because of his ability to attack off the dribble. Westbrook needs to be on the ball to hide his weaknesses = THT off the ball, his weakness.U excited for the Woj tweet in July saying “Chris Boucher has agreed to a 3 year 40 million dollar deal to return to the Toronto Raptors”??? https://t.co/JyV62K7OeI2/28/22 Part 1...
