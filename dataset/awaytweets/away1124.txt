Carolina Hurricanes vs Washington O6@bandz81 @sactowncrown I disagree with you, if the Kings are top 10 in defense they will be a playoff team. They're capable, I watched them live against the Chicago Bulls and I was amazed how good they are, they lack consistency more than talent. Most teams would want Chimezie Metu on their team.The Chicago Bulls have definitely struggled as of late 

But they won their most important games which were against the Raptors and Cavaliers who are right behind them in the standings

Important games tonight as all three of those teams are in action

https://t.co/uB6UJRcrPdI love this, the Boston Celtics in first place, and the Chicago Bulls in fifth place, guess my delivery guy is going to be shutting his mouth soon@chicagobulls NBA Champions. Calling it now@TheSASBurner @KOT4Q The Celtics choked a 14 point 4th quarter lead to the Chicago bulls this year@ZachLaVine @DeMar_DeRozan please guys, You need to play more together, some time seems like both give efforts separate, if you play like a team you can will do big thinks @chicagobulls@Lakers are very bad when they need a bucket. That’s all the playoffs is. More half court offense and less foul calls down the stretch.

They’re F’d

Just because Miami and Chicago are top in the east doesn't mean anything. Bulls are trash against good teams and Miami blowing games left and right. Bucks and Grizzlies are the real testsI predicted that the #chicagobulls would finish first in the east however the Boston Celtics at the end of it all proved the be the number 1 team in the east 🍀 @celtics https://t.co/67VNUTZdaoThere is nobody who wants to face the Chicago Bulls healthy in the playoff having Lonzo Ball.@chicagobulls @ACFresh21 NiceWhat’s up with lonzo @chicagobullsChicago Bulls: The importance of Patrick Williams' return (Pippen Ain't Easy)

 #ChicagoBulls #NBA@fekeney @gustavomvzuchi @chicagobulls celtics 1st seed!!!@HaroldsBro talked for about an hour. I learned that he was a basketball player with the Chicago Bulls in town for playoff game with Trail blazers. I'd noticed a lot of tall people!

New item $6.99The Celtics would beat the 1995-96 Chicago Bulls by 50As Donovan, DeRozan campaigns fade, who will win #NBA awards? @McGrawDHSports makes some picks. @chicagobulls https://t.co/fPx1D3yHPR@AtomsBomb41 I haven’t heard much Scal, but during my years in Chicago I would have argued (former Mav) Stacey King was the biggest homer on Bulls telecasts. It was hilarious and his work on the telestrator was always good for a laugh.
