Instead of that, they got a guy 20/10 guy who doesn't need to be more than a 3rd option for them next year when Beal and Kuzma return to health. And a pick.@GerryStackhouse @bealswrld @dallasmavs Dallas just took on more guaranteed salary with Bertans and Dinwiddie. Bertans isnt an NBA player and hes guaranteed 17mil per for the next 2 years

Wizards brought Dinwiddie in to run the point alongside Beal and Dinwiddie just can't do that at all. He's a scorer, nothing else..@Enormous_Papaya @LoneStarSmoker @dallasmavs condolences, my friend #TSCares https://t.co/f1R3Xlvl4YDallas booing a man with a clothing company called Maverick is ironic. 

#WrestleManiai really want mark williams on this team @dallasmavs@GerryStackhouse @bealswrld @dallasmavs Dallas got Bertans and Dinwiddie. Washington would have given Dallas a 1st round pick to take those guys for free.
