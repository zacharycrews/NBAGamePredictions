1. The Bulls didn't have to defend a team as talented and as stacked as the 2017 Dubs.
2. The Steve Kerr advantage.
3. Chicago's offense was 7.6 PTS better while their defense was 5.8 better than league average. The Warriors' were at 6.8 and 4.8.Chicago Bulls vs. Boston Celtics - 1/15/22 Free Pick &amp; NBA Betting Prediction https://t.co/macgMgAcPS

The chicago bulls were dominating the East and a run of bad games were due.

I just hope today's battering isn't going to affect them in the long term. It's hard to see.
