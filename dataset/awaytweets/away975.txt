My question is, deriving from your statement: Were there teams that went to Finals despite being under .500 through 65 games, besides the 1975-76 Phoenix Suns? 
I'm asking if you know other teams that repeated such feat.
Thank you in advance.Vintage 90s NBA Phoenix Suns Starter Black Purple Stitched Pullover Hoodie XL https://t.co/K8LEO4qZlr@section_sport yep. If they're the #1 seed, you'd get one of Minnesota/LAC (as it stands now with no play-in upsets) and that'd be a cake walk for Phoenix. Then you get the winner of 4/5 (Utah/Dallas now), another cake walk.

Conference Finals is anyone's guess but I'd take the Suns there too.Miami continues their homestand as they take on the Western Conference Champion Phoenix Suns. Game starts Wednesday at 7:30pm on NBA League Pass and Bally Sports Sun.@section_sport You gotta think the Suns have a great chance if their healthy. GSW? slim chance. MEM? No way. Utah/DAL? We should know the answer to this by now.

The west is Phoenix's for the taking@Darkseid241 I don't know cause I honestly don't even know how they lost the coins. Maybe Landon is connected to the Gods well his phoenix side because they are associated with the sun god. But Legacies doesn't seem to be following Egyptian Mythology.  I missed something somewhereThe Miami Heat defeat the Houston Rockets 123-106. Herro and Oladipo shined bright on this Monday night. 
The team will look to keep the positive momentum going against the Phoenix Suns this Wednesday, March 9. @MiamiHEAT #PressBoxUPHOENIX SUNS vs

I’ve enjoyed it but I still live right down the road from Scottsdale Stadium spring home with a Giants. Play ball!Interesting article outlining Book’s routine on game day. So proud to have him on the Phoenix Suns Team!  
#ValleyProud https://t.co/Cj5IoQH0au@WSJMag @DevinBook Wonderful article that shows the sacrifices Book makes to “Be Legendary.” So very grateful  that he plays for the Phoenix Suns! #
#ValleyProud@redriverboat2 Look at Miami and Phoenix, Miami have been significantly more injured than the Suns and the drop off has been much less. https://t.co/VT25ZclMKqSOL CRESTA

[Steam] https://t.co/TY5dHUafwW https://t.co/3rGM7QeMI5@haralabob I’m gonna pick Miami vs Phoenix, will pick Phoenix to win but this year seems more wide open than most! Health, as always is key. Seems like Suns have the best path if healthy. But I could see Nuggets or Clips knocking them out if CP isn’t 100%.If you like #CARS, you will love this article.
