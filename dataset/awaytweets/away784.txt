Dejounte Murray O18.5 (Low Points Line) - Murray is coming back tonight from a rest game. The Spurs are at home up against a poor Houston Rockets side who are not defensively great. In Murray’s last 5 he has hit; 27, 29, 16, 19, 19 points. #nbabets #bettingpicks #dejountemurrayDirect

https://t.co/My0JtJCNWqThe Houston Rockets Terik Black had 64 hotdogs in his pockets while playing.@Metaserph At least a minor part of my little brain is pretending to work 😎

I have some personal connections to Houston  (spent some time  there in 2018). Rockets, Astros and Cougars 😄✌🏼Rockets should give Brooklyn their picks back for Harden!

 I will say, the best case scenario is for Harden to walk in  this upcoming FA, but the trade Houston made with Brooklyn looks a lot better with Harden leaving the Nets this soon.#Cavs head coach J.B. Bickerstaff said that focusing on containing the Hornets and dictating the overall speed is the priority tonight.

Charlotte is only behind the Houston Rockets in terms of pace.I follow @JHarden13. I wanted him to go to the @sixers when he was still with the @HoustonRockets. My thought process was he needs a really good big. I thought @AntDavis23 should’ve gone to HOU instead of the @Lakers. I just hope this drama with the @BrooklynNets end soon.Free @KyrieIrving, he doesn’t need a vaccine down in Houston!!
