I don’t know about the house as regards movies#Wizards #NBA it looks like an NBA championship is open for all comers, except for the Golden State Warriors are 10-1 and looking to win another championship. At the same time Washington Wizards, and the Chicago Bulls are playing pretty well. Don't count out Phoenix though.Nets about to be the 2 seed, a half game back of the 1 seed ... Washington Wizards

If you don’t think so then idk. He surely turned Kevin Love into a jump shooter. Washington Wizards 8-3 first in the East1) The Washington Wizards have the East's best record &amp; three former Lakers
2) Dennis Schroeder just nearly dropped 40 against the defending champs
3) The Bulls are second in the East in large part to Caruso
4) Drummond is thriving in Philly

But last year LeBron didn't have helpHarrell - MVP candidate, leading the wizards

Drummond - doing great in his Philly role

Schroder - doing amazing in Boston

Kuzma - playing very well in Washington

Caruso - playing awesome in Chicago
