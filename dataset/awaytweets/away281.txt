@mcgboye I mean the Suns are on a 14 game winning streak and NBA media houses are barely talking about them even with CP3 on the team. So how will young and less recognized players on team get noticed all the way in Phoenix?

I do love the players they are the most emotional team. I really love Phoenix Suns so much no matter what it is. Love ya all.💋♥️Hey @FanaticsSupport, I scrolled thru 20 pages of the "Holiday Doorbusters" listed on your web site and not one Phoenix Suns item was discounted. You guys have something against Suns fans? Please correct me if I'm wrong. #SunsFrom “#Witch cards of the Sun &amp; the Moon with Phoenix &amp; Dragon”

You overestimate your power.
It is useless to follow the glory of the past.
Let's do your best with the power as it is.
