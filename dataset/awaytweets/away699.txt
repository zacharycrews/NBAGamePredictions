@utahjazz | #TakeNote https://t.co/CqxiNy6ZUR@get_jeffery @ultimatejazzfan First: there are plenty of reasons why poor character would be a valid reason to not wish to honor Stockton anymore. Ex: If he started publicly attacking the Utah Jazz org or the city of SLC. If he began publicly praising ISIS or Kim Jong Un.Those Utah Jazz teams with this nutso and the pedo Malone. How nuts was that? https://t.co/jR7JilPOWkGood to know there are generations of Utah Jazz that are bats**t crazy about Covid.Both John Stockton and Karl Malone trending. The UTah Jazz top legends are also the most problematic.

By all accounts they should have lost in the first round to the Utah Jazz who had the 3rd best offense and the 8th best defense. But the Rockets got momentum and beat the Jazz in 5.the Utah Jazz stoppers https://t.co/Px6KoAi8b6Let me make you guys aware of something before I go to bed.

The Utah Jazz made it to the Final at least! 

The Packers are the NY Knicks.@itspikaaa The Utah Jazz haven‚Äôt won a championship haven‚Äôt been to a NBA finals  since 1998 when they lost to Jordan Aaron Rodgers has got a  ringMaybe we never should have called it The Last Dance. They're the Utah Jazz from that doc. https://t.co/dBitP72a40Rewatching last night's @utahjazz - Piston game.  Clarkson's 4th quarter rebound, dribble out, cut back in for the basket was an absolute thing of beauty. Especially when he cuts back through - We are so lucky to have him on our team @JordanClarksons 
https://t.co/s1Az0C3qwOMark Pope was asked about his relationship with Utah Jazz exec Danny Ainge.

‚ÄúWhat I love talking to Danny about is the trends and the direction of the game.‚Äù

Packers lolAnyone who genuinely feels like trading @mconley11 is a good idea for the @utahjazz is either clueless or giving up all hope of us being competitive@miiller_tom @dmorey @JoelEmbiid @SacramentoKings @utahjazz I saw that. But I also saw they were considering a trade package including Haliburton for Simmons.

I know they would much rather keep Hali.

But if Haliburton is the final snag in a deal to whether Ben Simmons ends up on the Kings before the deadline, I think the SAC does do it.@SpencerKeele @dmorey @JoelEmbiid @SacramentoKings @utahjazz They‚Äôve sent the word out that they're building around DF and TH In the backcourt.@mattschneidman The Utah jazz of nfl quarterbacks@DrGuru_ Nah Dog. They they Utah Jazz of the NFL.@JuMosq Personally this one hurts less because I'm fucking numb from all the prior years. Cool being a sports fan is so fun. Time to focus on my other team, the Utah Jazz. I'm sure they won't disappoint me in the playoffsAaron Rodgers and the Green Bay Packers are the Utah Jazz of the NFL,  regular season winner, playoff loser never a real contender@Suns go to 36-9 defeat @Pacers by 10 113 ‚Äì103 next up  @utahjazz #UTAvsPHX #ValleyProudI hate to say it, but my Packers look more and more like the Utah Jazz bro. Don't do shit come playoff time@miiller_tom @dmorey @JoelEmbiid @SacramentoKings @utahjazz Idk‚Ä¶ I think SAC has to get Ben NOW. A superstar has put the Kings on their short list. rn, SAC has the best offer. If they wait til offseason, other teams will be more competitive. Simmons &amp; Fox makes so much sense. Hali is great, but Simmons is a much higher caliber player.@Mike801_ @utahjazz Lol it‚Äôs disappointing.

Hali will be way underpaid for the next 2 seasons after this one because of rookie contract. Tobias will be way overpaid for the next 2 seasons.
