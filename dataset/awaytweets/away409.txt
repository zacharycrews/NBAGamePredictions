We dont need to trade Julius (honestly, not possible) We just need to embrace our youth. And LIVE with the results.@hornets His lips not it lolThe Hornets begin their 6-game road trip tonight in Dallas. 

Terry Rozier will return for Charlotte, while Luka Doncic will be out for the Mavericks.

[via r/charlottehornets Dec 13, 2018 #Hornets]I'm a @CleGuardians fan. No titles since my father was 4 years old. 

I'm a @hornets fan. 34 yrs and 0 appearances in a conference title game. 

I'm a @Panthers fan. 2 Super Bowl losses &amp; a current team that's nowhere near contention.
