They’re a fun team to watch.

Eddie, in the video, KPJ seemed oblivious to his almost-triple double. Wasn’t trying to get the rebound at first.@SunsfanTrey If the Suns lose tonight it's because Phoenix didn't match/beat the temperature heat record. Record is 81 degrees, we only got to 80.

Example

GSW 100 PTS
SUNS 104......So if you subtract 3.5 from 104 , you'll have 100.5 that means they won with 0.5 but we lose if they play 103 against GSW 100@gnuts12 @Suns @utahjazz Even when they get bounced. Exhibit A:

I sold them short.Can we please skip to May already and press play on a seven-game series between the Phoenix Suns and Golden State Warriors in the Western Conference Finals?

For @basketbllnews, I examine how both teams are already on a season-long collision course: https://t.co/V1oeXs0czg@StephenCurey @Saltysalo1 @milo_wessel @MikkeyG59 @statmuse @Suns @mikal_bridges @CP3 @DeandreAyton Ion got time either but y’all thinking y’all a lock for anything in December is hilarious. Just don’t block me cus I’m on yo ass when the playoffs startPhoenix Suns are at the end of 3 games in 4 nights, second night of a back to back with a flight in there, missing their leading scorer. No one would worry if Suns drop this game on the road against a GSW thirsting for revenge

My greedy ass, however, wants that 19th win a row@watchagame @RocketsfanSid @HPbasketball I mean, It's not, I'd put him below everyone else on that list, but the Suns' success at least puts him in the mix. 
It's also undeniable that the team's W-L record has a strong influence. If Phoenix drops a couple of spots he won't be in the conversation anymore.@Suns @warriors @BALLYSPORTSAZ @AZSports @az_mejor Here we go again.@NBALatam @Suns @warriors WarriorsI already can’t wait to get home, get dressed down in some warm ass clothes, and watch the @Suns game!!@7thlifeKarl @StephenCurey @milo_wessel @MikkeyG59 @statmuse @Suns @mikal_bridges @CP3 @DeandreAyton Bro shut ur meat riding ass, this isn't 2018 lebron is a top 5 player but he ain't top 1 like he was in 2018 he's good but not a monster who can carry bad teams, and Steph right now is as good as him if not better@Saltysalo1 @7thlifeKarl @milo_wessel @MikkeyG59 @statmuse @Suns @mikal_bridges @CP3 @DeandreAyton That’s why I stopped responding lmaoo, ion got time lol.@MettaWorld37 @Suns what sup @MettaWorld37@StephenCurey @7thlifeKarl @milo_wessel @MikkeyG59 @statmuse @Suns @mikal_bridges @CP3 @DeandreAyton Bro don't talk to these dumbasses, first it was just the pre season when our B squad blew out their big 3, then on opening night it was just a fluke, now it's wait till play offs, then it'll be wait till next season, their dumbasses don't waste ur time on emWarriors -7
The warriors just lost to the Suns, but they were on the road. The Suns also won’t have Booker for the whole game this time. GS will adjust to how Phoenix played them first. Steph won’t have many nights off like he was. Idc who guarding him. GSW make a statement!@ajshapi1 @badlhoch @Suns @BALLYSPORTSAZ Well sure. But Bob’s tweet said since Oct 30th, where the Suns have won 18 straight and the Jazz have lost to the likes of the Magic and the Pelicans.  But yes that did happen too.@Suns @warriors @BALLYSPORTSAZ @AZSports @az_mejor let’s hopeSuns look to outshine the Pistons

They are a WELL OILED MACHINE. 
It's these losses against Teams we could beat if we just played hard for 48 minutes that are Killing me.

Also 5-7 @ The Garden isn't helping.CP signature 🖊️ https://t.co/WnmrcQWZvp@ll0ydd0bler @cooliworldpeace @NBAonTNT @warriors @Suns Bruh😂… he was involved in a transaction that helped the warriors… he didn’t “give” the warriors anything, nor did he try to make the trade lean in our favor, it just happened to work out as such@Suns hit a 3 get me my early payoutGreat first half by the #Suns! The bench is stepping up big time with no Devin Booker (Hamstring). In the 3rd quarter right now, Phoenix leads 80-62. #ValleyProud https://t.co/DieDjZSHoG@NBA @Suns Overrated@NBA @Suns We don’t careBoard 🏀

#PhantomCam Johnson (12 PTS) and the @Suns lead in Q3 on NBA League Pass: https://t.co/V0kkYEEIkG https://t.co/6S7akUwYDw@Suns NiceGo @suns go!!!!@DemiseGE @cooliworldpeace @NBAonTNT @warriors @Suns and kd didn’t ‘give’ anything.  he got too.  but he didn’t have to.  that’s the point@brawadis It’s a bunch of grandpas bruh that’s why!! Go @Suns@Jack_Cardinal @Suns As I watch it from Indonesia, I thought it was something that had been done often. That's why I searched it on Twitter.@DemiseGE @cooliworldpeace @NBAonTNT @warriors @Suns for basically a useless draft pick.  sure.Former Phoenix Suns second round pick is now on the Denver Nuggets https://t.co/GPdPNJR1cI@cooliworldpeace @ll0ydd0bler @NBAonTNT @warriors @Suns Y’all childish acting like kd tried to “give” warriors shit when it was another man’s decision(Deangelo) to choose to agree to come to gsw just as much as it was Durant’s to go to the nets, kd ain’t decide shit except give the nets leverage to ask for a bit more@ShamsCharania @TheAthletic @Stadium Phoenix Suns legend@chicano_malo @Suns LFG Fellas.

How are the Warriors sitting at home for 2 full days while the Suns are playing in Phoenix today and then traveling to San Fran tomorrow? It’s pretty much a scheduled loss. It’s not great.@ParkerRenberg @savitriia @Suns The Suns’ score makes it perfect@cooliworldpeace @ll0ydd0bler @NBAonTNT @warriors @Suns It was the same as any other transaction in the nba, two teams tryna form a deal that benifits each of them the fuckjn most… kd didnt try to give the warriors fuckjn nothin… warriors wanted to make the most of it and so did the nets@Suns Nice 
lets go guys keep on stepping it up@Suns are freaking legit https://t.co/cDbbdcIcPE@savitriia @Suns I never even heard the announcement to vote, at this point I’m convinced nothing is real🚨 UPDATE: Deandre Ayton - Phoenix Suns has a Double Double
