He took a team that wasn’t in the playoffs for how many years to the damn Finals and they have the best team in the league by 6 to 7 games. #PhoenixSuns fight for your coach Smh @Suns@ALEXBOBAlNE @Suns @BannerHealth Okay 🤨💀@Suns @FrysFoodStores pls have some east valley locations@Suns @BannerHealth Iffe minutes or elseBased on the stat, the Lakers will definitely lose in their visit to Phoenix and Golden State, but the Suns and Warriors might save their key players for Play-Offs since they have already secured their positions. Spurs must win at any cost. https://t.co/ukmpqKMgA7@Suns @BannerHealth IFFE SZN@casualtakeking Smh. With All due  respect, @MarkJackson13. I may not get paid for my view but people people was saying the same thing about the Jordan Bulls until Phil Jackson took over.Phoenix suns acquired Jason Kidd and made it in2 the Playoffs.

After the Anthony Davis comments, Phoenix wants to kill them.Do y'all think the Phoenix Suns organization knows that if it releases a Devin Booker 90s sun burst jersey it would be the end of times? That's why they haven't done it?@Suns space Dey for new fan? https://t.co/7QdHVn7soO@Suns Iffe?Can Devin Booker and the Phoenix Suns win this title this year, the answer is yes they could, and if they do, will they have had the best player in the league.

The answer is yes.As it stands right now the Phoenix Suns will finish with the leagues best record, and the question will be, do they have the leagues best player on their team to win the title this year.What are the chances of the number one team in the NBA the Phoenix Suns, to finish as the champion of the basketball world.

The Suns currently hold the leagues top record with a chance to get in the top record holders if they pass the 64 win mark.Does the Phoenix Suns Best Record Mean a Championship

 #DENvsLALIf the @Suns handle business as expected against the @Lakers, and the @spurs win a game in their next two matchups, the @warriors can eliminate the Lakers from the play-in tourney and essentially end their season. 🔥🔥🔥@KennySoloGaming @Suns @BannerHealth That’s fair.

Though not my main team, I like the GSW team. Looks like Poole-Thompson partnership works... kinda like Curry-Thompson. Hope this shows that my opinion has some merit.@getnickwright Nick, Dallas will not beat Memphis or Phoenix. They both have the first two seeds locked throughout the playoffs. They have better teams. Dallas will have to go through either Denver with Jokic or Utah before the 2nd round match up.

@Suns #NBA75 #NBA #ThunderUp@arisonsned @outonbluesix Break in the Sun, no. Phoenix and the Carpet, very vaguely, but it would be the 1997 version, when I was 13.The NBA bubble meant nothing. The Phoenix Suns went UNDEFEATED in their bubble stint, and look at them now.

Oh... Oh they're the Number 1 seed for two years in a row? Well this is awkward.3 Phoenix Suns Players Show Silver Linings from Chris Paul's Injury https://t.co/D9WmtCE8zV https://t.co/2wxGN94FZm@PapiSoloTweets The @Suns have to be praying that the @memgrizz and @warriors face each other in the second roundGet @K1 some @Suns tickets@KittyKatDeee @ae_allchin @Kenny58211098 @NBA @Suns @FBI But I don’t know if you were around at the time the Chicago Bulls had the best record and won a championship! You might’ve been about five years old The Golden State Warriors were actually compared to the team do you want to know why? Because the warriors have that record haha@LilMonsterJDR @cryweirdolmaooo @jvhein2 @Suns As a Suns fan I agree Giannis exposed us last year which is why they beefed up this year's team. No excuses, they just have to go out and win. It will be tougher this year.@Burritoexp @Suns No, you should make some great food, and watch at home. Maybe give me half of that $14,000. &lt;Ost of it would come back to you anyway. LOL@ManuelM76131192 @ae_allchin @Kenny58211098 @NBA @Suns @FBI And?

Anyone else fascinated with phoenixes :3? https://t.co/1c3mCkyOWDThanks for supporting the Basement Goblins tonight! Hope everyone enjoyed the Awko Phoenix interview at the end (I know I did lol).

We take the series 2-0 vs TU. Puts us in pretty good standing for the Playoffs at the end of this league. 

Stream Sun! Match #5 Mon! See you then!@jeremeaz @8727Winkyy @Suns Maannnn you really did em like that 🤣🤣🤣🏀 The Los Angeles @Lakers are playing the Denver @nuggets and the Phoenix @Suns in their next two games.

🤔 How much chance then to see these two in the playoffs? https://t.co/HixIO70svL@JustTheTip_18 @Suns That’s fair, and I won’t argue that. Just seems like folks get mighty critical after one of their VERY few losses.4/2/91 – Benched for 3min early in the 3Q for not playing aggressively enough, KJ scored 16p that quarter and finished w/37p/20a (his season-high in A's) as the Phoenix #Suns (50th win) cruised to a 131-117 win over Utah. X-Man: 28p/12r. Hornacek: 18p.

Dan last Tuesday: “The Grizzlies aren’t as good as Phoenix”

Grizzlies beat Suns without Ja and 3 other starters 😏@goomvi Crazy how every team except the league-leading Phoenix Suns is fake4/2/71 – The Phoenix #Suns acquired Otto Moore from the Detroit Pistons for future considerations (1972 1st: Bob Nash). Moore also signed a contract w/the Virginia Squires of the ABA in March so the Suns had to litigate his rights to make the ABA contract invalid. #ValleyProud https://t.co/DtwiBR1r5sPhoenix Suns’ Mikal Bridges nears top of NBA’s DPOY betting odds https://t.co/2q6pzdeU7c@KTeaiwa @Suns Finally got to see your show Katerina!
