Looks like he’ll clear protocol for Tuesday’s game against the Oklahoma City Thunder.OTD Jan. 9, 1951. Room in Louisville! Six NBA teams fold after 1949-50 season (Anderson, Sheboygan, Waterloo, Chicago, Denver &amp; St. Louis). Washington Capitals now fold mid-season w/10-25 mark. NBA won't return to DC 'til '73 when Baltimore relocates as Capital Bullets (Wizards). https://t.co/u9bxi7WAvkSub 6’0” guards:
