@TheTraeYoung 21 pts &amp;9reb https://t.co/znCVKjyGLm@celtics Looks like another first round exit for the Boston Celtics this year if they even make the playoffs with the way they‚Äôre playing@hayescarroll_ @celtics focus on your failing franchise@celtics I‚Äôd rather be a top 4 in offense team with a top 20 in defense 

Than a top 4 in defense and a 20th offense like this Ass team!!! Get some shooting!!! https://t.co/QdPldTCzlR@gogonzalez04 @omezy2424 @celtics At least the Hornets can win and know how to play team basketball@BrownOfJaylen @celtics 6 game win streak our bigest win streak is 3 hawks are clear@celtics Somebody tell this team that there isn't a rule against scoring in the 4th quarterThe 2022 Boston Celtics do not deserve a single fan watching them if this is how they‚Äôre gonna play‚Ä¶ 

I will not watch another second of #celtics basketball until the playoffs.

Translation: I‚Äôm not gonna see them play again cuz they‚Äôre not even good enough for the 10 seed.@THCeltics @celtics Jaylen had 7 turnovers tonight. As a playmaker and a ball handler, he‚Äôs a butcher.I‚Äôm over this @celtics team this season. No more up at 4am or shuffling things around to free up time at 11am just to watch this garbage.
If I‚Äôm accidentally around and they are playing I‚Äôll probably have a look but I‚Äôm not getting burnt anymore.@celtics Only consistancy we get is inconsistency. Love it üò≠It‚Äôs one thing to be in your crib . . . it‚Äôs another to be in someone else‚Äôs talking the most smack to you &amp;&amp; not being able to do anything about . My getaway wknd starting off terrible !! Thank you @celtics@max_maryott @omezy2424 @celtics Hahahaha I‚Äôm with you. I have been loyal to the Celtics but man it is becoming so frustrating to see them play like that. It‚Äôs like having to Carmelo Anthony‚Äôs on the team hahaha. At this point I think I‚Äôll watch the hornets games üòÇ@celtics perfect post. good job tweeter account manager.  thank God you didn't try and spin this. Perfect!@LordBrOFFICIAL @celtics First time in 2 years the entire Hawks Team has been healthy; no injuries.

And One word Travis Schlenk - GM. (Former GM of Golden State)

He knows how to build a complete team@LostxSawce @celtics mutual?@celtics The @OfficialNBARefs saw that @Celtics attempted more free throws than Hawks in the first 3 quarters so they called cheap foul calls to put @Celtics in the penalty with 9 minutes left so whenever the Cs fouled, it was automatic free throws for Hawks. Killed the Cs momentum. Lame.@BrownOfJaylen @Nesmith_stan @celtics 6 game winstreak we‚Äôre better@celtics It doesn‚Äôt appear to bother any of the players when they lose. The NBC Boston announcers are even worse. Tatum either goes off the 40+ or he has a 5-20 night. Why????? Does anyone in the organization care they are losing???Does anyone actually enjoy watching @celtics?@celtics easy winü§£ü§£ü§£@celtics Some@celtics Bias Boston Fans Didnt Wanna Vote For Tatum &amp; Not JB üó≥ Ok Hold Another L üëåüèæ‚úÖ@celtics Just Lose Baby.@K843_T @celtics Led his team to an L.@celtics Bums!y‚Äôall boys just gave up this year huh?? @celtics üòí https://t.co/6pdUnRVHtG@celtics Brad Stevens must go@celtics Supprime@THCeltics @celtics That does nail it, JT fail day@celtics When the hell are they going to trade for a PROFICIENT THREE POINT SHOOTER!!!!!!!!!!!!@celtics HADEH!The Boston Celtics are a different team every single game.@THCeltics @celtics The allstar has got to pad his stats...@LordBrOFFICIAL @celtics These games are all ‚Äòfixed‚Äô I believe.

Which means I prolly won‚Äôt be watching them at all again this year@celtics Frauds are back. Good to see the real C's again üòÅ@celtics Had a chance to take the lead and tie twice Tatum took 2 bad 3's, from there on all hell broke loose smh this team don't need no damn "play making non scoring PG" how they gon get them going when they're super inconsistent against bad teams and horrible against decent teams?I now hear ‚Äúthe Boston Celtics‚Äù in Homer Simpson‚Äôs ‚Äúthe Denver Broncos‚Äù voice.@celtics ya‚Äôll better have that @spurs front office on speed dial https://t.co/zRSSb3pwUTI being wrong, especially when it comes to basketball game spreads. @celtics I had y‚Äôall at +7.5 on 4 parlays. Can y‚Äôall figure out how to close out games already!@max_maryott @omezy2424 @celtics No teamwork also, all they do is shoot the ball when they grab it. They force so many shots. That it is even annoying to see them play.@celtics Final? Are you describing the game or the season?Tatum and brown suck BECAUSE the Celtics suck at taking risk. Make everyone available including Tatum &amp; brown. See what‚Äôs out there. How hard is it to get a PG. Ime is the worst coach in 25 years @celtics TRADE THE COACH. @TomBrady could coach this team better than ime. #FIREIME@celtics Pathetic effort‚Ä¶@THCeltics @celtics ratio@celtics All these long stretches the Celtics go without scoring is the perfect proof that @balldontstop is full of shit.

Imei has to trust the boys at the moment and get them minutes@celtics Horford. https://t.co/yAfNX6GHWf@celtics First Celtics game and yikes@celtics Can we start to give the ball to JB when he is the only good finisher in the game? We were losing by one, Tatum checked in and took the ball out of brown's hands and in a blink the lead was 11Tough loss for the C's @celtics fell to 25-25 on the season after loosing 108-92 to the @ATLHawks.
