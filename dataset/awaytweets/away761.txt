Thanks@nishiqie @AndyinMN Yall are tripping, Orlando says no quickly. Franz Wagner and Suggs fit our time line and have shown high potential. Ben can’t/won’t shoot, is disgruntled, and costs a fortune. Also, an unprotected 1st? What. Magic are rebuilding, Simmons dismantles that. No chance.#NBA Big Odds!

Avg 30/gm against Orlando in 3 games. Magic last in league in fouls; DeRozan gets to line a lot. In the blow out game against Magic he just missed the line. Magic like to play Bulls close.
