Orlando Magic wing Gary Harris could also be a buyout candidate for BKN to sign #NBA #BrooklynNets@OrlandoMagic TAKE NOTES. The team always talks about getting more fans. When the team has 11 wins we shouldn‚Äôt be charging 20 dollars just to get in the stadium. Also 150+ to sit lower bowl with 0 lounge access is also ridiculous. https://t.co/CylTfoLP1j@OrlandoMagic y‚Äôall won‚Äôt do this next Saturday https://t.co/Kts5NF8Yqt@OrlandoMagic take notes here lol https://t.co/oLWuttH1jA@PlayoffFultzV2 I totally agree he should have been inducted into the HOF. And when it does happen I want to be there to help celebrate. Hedo considers Orlando his second home and he still supports the Magic.Now Playing on LITE 99 Orlando Every Little Thing She Does Is Magic by The Police #nowplaying #orlando #orlandomusic #softrock #oldies #florida #lastplayed #recentlyplayed@kp20magic @OrlandoMagic @FieldsAuto He didn't pack clothes he's got all the clothes he needs already on@drivera94gmail1 @wendellcarter34 @OrlandoMagic Lol sheeeeit man https://t.co/VNi2e58cUT@ocafebelgrado Shaquille O'Neal no Orlando Magic@MavsStan41 I've been praising them for not really losing to bad teams this year and they embarrass me like that.
