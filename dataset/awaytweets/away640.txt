Suggs looked a lot more comfortable and in control by a mile. @OrlandoMagic #MagicTogether@WAYNOKA_ @Titanfan86 @memgrizz @jarenjacksonjr memphis is good whoever coach you put.  You have ja morant.  He easily can lead any team to the playoffs.  Jenkins is a tyronne lue who needs a lebron to win.  Put him in new york knicks or orlando magics, he will not go to the playoffs.@chicagoandmagic @bestirstrata23 @OrlandoMagic @PapaJohnsORL Dude he’s undefeated 😂😂Moritz Wagner - Orlando Magic
