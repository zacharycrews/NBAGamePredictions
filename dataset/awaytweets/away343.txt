The Heat's struggling shooter paired with a more aggressive Kyle Lowry to pace the team to an impressive win in Indiana. @GregSylvander had the guts to pick Miami, and he joins @EthanJSkolnick, who didn't.

This game marks the 2nd contest between these squads this season. Miami blew the Bucks out by 42 points in their season opener.Heat +5.5 ✅

The heat were leading for majority of the game and Kyle Lowry (26 pts, 9 assts) and Duncan Robinson (24 pts) really stepped up big for Miami leading them to a win on the road.@MikeInglisHEAT @MiamiHEAT Miss you Mike! You are the GOAT! Hope you are enjoying retirement@mystickybun @heat_razor @MiamiHEAT I agree that that is what Spo did with Bam but Bam was a very raw talent. Omer hits 3's he rebounds, he blocks shots. All these things the Heat have been lacking in the games they have lost. Spo should have been using him in preseason.Great team win in Indy for @MiamiHEAT last night especially being short handed. Onto the champs house tonight to close out this back to back road set in Milwaukee. Then it’s home for a week.Ende #Basketball Herren #NBA

Then again, in game 1 against Miami in the bubble, Brook got into foul trouble early and sat and Robin didn't play. Donte was the rim protection and it was a Heat layup line.
