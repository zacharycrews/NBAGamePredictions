The Bulls found a gem in AYO DOSUNMU. Now, all they have to do is polish that gem to make it shine bright.One thing no one ever mentions about the #Bulls dynasty is the huge sacrifice Ron Harper made.

Id stay away from that game unless you can get a fat + spread on either team while live betting. Slap spurs spread 2h if theyre down at end of 1h.@Founda_ Yo Chicago bulls then San Antonio who go wey?The Chicago Bulls will bounce back from their recent skid (via Thomas J. Brown)

Babyde Pegues@JohnnyH004 @arturasfanclub @chicagobulls @DeMar_DeRozan All he said was if they were to end the season right now they wouldn’t be in the playoffs, I think he knows seeding isn’t set until the last couple games basically with some outlier games.@AndrewYang As a @chicagobulls fan, I'm biased. DeMar has proven doubters wrong. Ayo is the steal of the draft and a feel good story. Caruso is no longer a meme and is just a legitimately great player. Lonzo is proving worthy of his early career hype. When healthy, they play gorgeous bball.Blck tight'

The Boston Celtics welcome back Harry Bird.

The LA Lakers welcome back Paula Abdul Jabber.@Ggdog108 @arturasfanclub @chicagobulls @DeMar_DeRozan Once Caruso first got hurt they were winning most of their games. They recently started losing.

They know that I’m going through a tough time, and what did they do? Invited me over at 10pm to walk around town and ding dong ditch. And they also gave me a Chicago bulls hat, which I’ve been trying to get for a while.@icetraelatte @chicagobulls @ATT @DeMar_DeRozan Lol good luck making play ins@BibsCorner He was also named a starter over 2 Chicago Bulls Shooting Guards

Zach Lavine and Michael Jordan@Coldheart_j @arturasfanclub @chicagobulls @DeMar_DeRozan Like I said stop with the excuses about the Injuries y'all should've been signing these other players out there to these 10 day contracts like my Bullsand the rest of the other teams have been then you guys could've been up there with us in the standings.@chicagobulls @DeMar_DeRozan Let's go Deebo #ProveEm@BearsFa48541406 @chicagobulls @KCJHoop Exactly, and watch the chip on LaVine's shoulder in second half. Let the team get healthy. Get in the playoffs and EC...watch our 2 closers and everyone close their season.@chicagobulls @NBCSChicago @ZachLaVine (LaVine) He is back 😍@Coldheart_j @arturasfanclub @chicagobulls @DeMar_DeRozan They were getting blown by the Nets, Warriors, and the weak ass Magic and barely bearing the Wizards, OKC, Cleveland and Indiana when Caruso got hurt that how much of an impact Caruso is with the Bulls when they were winning games when Caruso was injured.@BearsFa48541406 @chicagobulls @KCJHoop He’s gonna go MAD the next month to prove he should’ve been a starter@BleacherReport @ZachLaVine @DeMar_DeRozan @chicagobulls Are star@Ggdog108 @arturasfanclub @chicagobulls @DeMar_DeRozan And being a Allstar is a personal accolade. Trae has been the better player and earned his spot with nearly as much press as Zach and the bulls.@Ggdog108 @arturasfanclub @chicagobulls @DeMar_DeRozan The hawks players have been hurt for majority of the season and are now coming back. During December multiple teams had numerous games postponed; the hawks didn’t. They literally where flying in players signed that day. Btw the bulls had multiple games postponed in December.@Ggdog108 @arturasfanclub @chicagobulls @DeMar_DeRozan Lonzo got hurt a few weeks ago. They were winning without Caruso who has been hurt most of the season. DJJ plus minus is less than 1 showing the team barely improves when he is in. This team has also been significantly worst and losing to subpar teams.@FOFailureTWT you got me? @chicagobulls@chicagobulls “This is your captain speaking…” I like the sound of that@imamretired @KOT4Q @chicagobulls all star game baby@chicagobulls @ATT @DeMar_DeRozan ??

Without Zach the bulls can still win.@chicagobulls @arturasfanclub On their way to San Antonio, where they said Demar was washed and done for@windycity2117 @arturasfanclub @chicagobulls jokeim noah is ugly tho@Coldheart_j @arturasfanclub @chicagobulls @DeMar_DeRozan If Trae has an impact the Hawks would've been a top 5 team in the East right now instead of being the 12th in the East rught impact players make their team better all around and winning games.@imamretired @KOT4Q @chicagobulls of all people a chicago fan is talkingWhen your AMAZING @CSUSBNews student PA announcer is brought to tears after the first time he announces @CsusbMbb starters to the @chicagobulls intro song from Jordan era, it’s something special! “I love this song!” #LivingHisDream #ChampionPeople #WeDefineTheFuture@chicagobulls future cav@chicagobulls luv this...it feels like #CollegeEnthusiasm #team #GoBullsThe Chicago Bulls want to win a championship?

Trae is a 2x player of the week. And let’s not forget Zach had a great start to the season since he has been inferior to other guards.

So proud of you &amp; I know your Pops Frank is beaming, looking down on you from Heaven (probably holding a video camera filming). Pride of Compton HS &amp; Hub City! https://t.co/tfsPhJ6F9u@alex______0 @Ricardom1503 @agtotedaglizzy @chicagobulls Not saying this is gonna make it happen, but DeMar is really a frontcourt player, idk why they have him as backcourt. He hasn't played the 2 all year he's been playing the 3 and the 4@TheWienerCircle @DeMar_DeRozan @chicagobulls @bennythebull Hell yea fuck @TimBontemps @NickFriedell and anybody else who hated@SHCJaney @Dylan85439919 @chicagobulls Yeah but he was still voted as a starter.@austin16_sports @NBA @chicagobulls u are@chicagobulls Ok with that that king talk now… 👀.. lol@byron_c @Dylan85439919 @chicagobulls Kd's not playing@chicagobulls I really love this team https://t.co/kxj6NlSQ5iZach LaVine announced to the team that DeMar DeRozan was selected as an #NBAAllStar starter 🙌

https://t.co/u7Wjx5rMDQ@chicagobulls @DeMar_DeRozan This screams @hometown_design@Ricardom1503 @agtotedaglizzy @chicagobulls Not as a starter, Book replaced him to make the game@chicagobulls @ZachLaVine &amp; @DeMar_DeRozan both will All-Stars this year or Bulls fans are rioting. #BullsNation #NBAAllStar https://t.co/jXXVChyVU1@chicagobulls Disappointing how he isn’t a starter! It was much deserved@katieSmarto923 @Stacey21King @chicagobulls She's coming for Benny's job https://t.co/o0aS78Js34@Ricardom1503 @chicagobulls True but was ad a starter that year? I cant remember. But if so I’m all for it@chi_ale773 @chicagobulls_12 @arturasfanclub maybe if they listed demar as a forward which he is then all 3 woulda made it don’t blame trae who actually plays his position 😹Zach LaVine so real for this 💯

https://t.co/3LgskPbDf9@chicagobulls Trae young soesnt deserve the spot. Lavine is definitely better@chicagobulls Looks like Spirit Airlines to me. Wtf Reinsdorf@chicagobulls I’m crying red@chicagobulls Zach should be right there with him! But they are about to have ✌🏽All stars! 😤@Dylan85439919 @szn_playoffs @chicagobulls How many times you gonna tweet this and still be wrong about it@chicagobulls Love them@psorensen @ZachLaVine @chicagobulls yea but 2 Bulls starters would've been so sweet 🥺@weeklystocksco @IDTwoZero20 @NBAonTNT @DeMar_DeRozan @chicagobulls debatable but even if so its reeeeeally close@SLAMonline @chicagobulls So cool✊🏽@chicagobulls Love the chemistry of this 2021-22 Bulls team@kevinlpate If they want someone taken off, it should be Demar. But fan vote plays a HUGE part. Demar has fans in Chicago Toronto San Antonio and Cali, Lavine has to rely on old time fans and bulls fans. Not a good combo.@KingTunsil78 @ZachLaVine @chicagobulls @NBA Not even@chicagobulls After all what Zach went through with the shitty teams I don’t think he cares as much. He has a person that can make him a champI love watching @DeMar_DeRozan thrive out there as a Chicago Bull. Miss him on my Spurs, but the man is overdue this mainstream respect. #demarderozan #ALLSTARSTARTER@chicagobulls Absolute king, got snubbed but still upped his teammate@Ricardom1503 @chicagobulls that would be ideal but i doubt they’ll do that since he’s a guard and KD is a forward@chicagobulls @devnkeller Imagine, a change in the front office allowed this group to come together 😏 They got something nice here, looking forward to see how far they goProud of you Chicago Bulls you can do this. Bradley you will get back on the court if you decide to offensively dunk the ball and stop trying to lay it up when you already up there dunk the thing in the basket and show some emotions! Draw a foul! Get nasty!!@chicagobulls This was so wholesome https://t.co/fdqcNZ2SBa@Ricardom1503 @chicagobulls I don’t think so cause he isn’t a forward I think it has to be a forward that replaces kd@chicagobulls This is such a cool thing. The support they give each other is absolutely fantastic. This era of the Bulls has some time left together, and it's going to result in much more than a few All-Stars.@chicagobulls_12 @arturasfanclub y’all beat us with demar we wasn’t letting zach get in 😹 https://t.co/Z4SLXtee13@DeMar_DeRozan big congrats to the best guard in the east #ChicagoBulls@chicagobulls When @newbalance dropping those FLIGHT8 #1s? @ZachLaVine@chicagobulls that shit cute@chicagobulls Awww that’s so sweetZach being the one to tell DeMar and the team he was named an All-Starter is so fire.
