During December multiple teams had numerous games postponed; the hawks didn‚Äôt. They literally where flying in players signed that day. Btw the bulls had multiple games postponed in December.@Ggdog108 @arturasfanclub @chicagobulls @DeMar_DeRozan Lonzo got hurt a few weeks ago. They were winning without Caruso who has been hurt most of the season. DJJ plus minus is less than 1 showing the team barely improves when he is in.
