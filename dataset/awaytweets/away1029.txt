Hayes has missed Detroit’s previous two games, while Stewart has missed the last three.Detroit folks are not lying when we say the media really hates Detroit. Hate as in lazy—indifferent—uninformed—-dismissive opinions. It’s unreal. And there is no reason for it. The Pistons are one of the top 10 winningest franchises in league history.

detroit pistons@MIKoenig44 @MotorCityHoops @omarisankofa @Charlottean28 The Logistics argument does depend on the individual fan.
 
My gut is that Downtown Detroit is more central and easier to get to for the majority of Piston fans. 

I had so many AH tickets that went unused because people didn’t want to go that far away. People gladly go to DET.#MIAvsDET

I don’t know who the Detroit Pistons will end up with. 

But the organization will be getting the best version of whoever that player is.

That’s the bonus benefit of Cade Cunningham.

Including Clarkson, they would have flipped D’Angelo still &amp; Zubac &amp; Randle also is forgotten on this picture too.
