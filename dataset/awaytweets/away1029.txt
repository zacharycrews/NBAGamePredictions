My gut is that Downtown Detroit is more central and easier to get to for the majority of Piston fans. 

I had so many AH tickets that went unused because people didn‚Äôt want to go that far away. People gladly go to DET.#MIAvsDET

#Detroit https://t.co/IvV4pGiIKN@Keith_Langlois @DetroitPistons Do you think we will eventually see a lineup of Cade-Saddiq or Killian-Jerami-Bagley-Stewart to close games this season?
Why is Cory Joseph still getting starter minutes and closing out games?
Can Bagley cement himself as the starting PF next season?#MIAvsDET
