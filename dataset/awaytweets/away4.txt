https://t.co/Ll4WAnJQCt@GalFerenc82 @tankathon I thought the Rockets have the right to swap the Nets pick and Rockets pick, not all the picks the Nets own as that wouldn't make sense? Nets didn't own that pick when they made the Houston trade.The Houston Rockets P.J. Tucker had a six pack of budlight for breakfast on game day.@PauloAlvesNBA GM bro!

Highest of the 3 picks - out of Rockets, Nets and Sixers - goes to Houston.
Second highest goes to Brooklyn, third highest goes to Utah.

Nets are basically not able to select first, even theoretically.HOUSTON ROCKETS OFFICIALLY BACK TODAY https://t.co/vuznKYQyze@TheHoopCentral @HoustonRockets Will make the playoffs this year!  @JalenGreen  will put league on Notice.The Houston Rockets play regular season basketball today. https://t.co/wIBCGT4VcBThe Houston Rockets Eric Gordan had a falling out with his uncle billy.So the Houston Rockets will clearly have a better record than the Los Angeles Lakers this season, there’s no way the jazz will too, right.

#manhattanassassin#12If the Lakers shoot the same volume and % from 3 in the 2nd half as they did in the 1st, they will shoot worse than Houston Rockets did in that infamous game 7 of the 2018 WCF.@PatrickNurseFTW Yep.

I hope the rookies will show their potential exceed everyone's expectations.@Odirtyxblaster @BLima790 Ask for help and also ask how many games y’all need to win a WS it’s not rocket science. If y’all would have won all 4 games in Houston then there wouldn’t be an argument. It’s the World Series l, teams are going to go back and forward on each other!!!The Houston Rockets Terik Black had two chains.Houston Rockets James Harden is back!!!!!!!!@youngthug @JHarden13 I hope he gets a ring too. He would have already had a ring when he played with Chris Paul together on the Houston Rockets but Chris Paul got hurt.My analysis after the 1st 3 minutes of Lakers v Warriors is that if they can't hit shots the #Rockets will embarrass them bc Houston can/will score.@onlyonewalker and @Amen__92__ discuss Texans getting their 1st win, Rockets starting the regular season, the departure of Jack Easterby, and their Top 5 Rookie CB's so far this season. #WeAreTexans #Rockets #Astros #Houston  https://t.co/IeQn1Hic30@ChaseStackwells @Kevinporterjr @HoustonRockets @geniusandvanity Thank you@ChancellorTV @BobanMarjanovic @HoustonRockets How many GOAT’s? https://t.co/6m1YIcnU5dHouston Astros, Houston Texans, -, Houston Rockets, Houston Dynamo. https://t.co/YfHaFQmgGuThe Houston Rockets will win the championship this year@ChrysNBA Harden's points very often come at the expense of his teammates.

Tucker had the Run DMC CD playing during the game.@seanie_bhoy Too many ex Rockets. Morey enabled that in Houston.@shaqtin @NBAonTNT That's why he missed with that raggedy ass shimmy🤬🤣🤣🤣😭😭😭 you quite on us Blood @HoustonRockets💯 I don't even care that you wanted a trade to get a ship💯 you went out bad-bad‼️‼️ and you still ain't got that ship you left to get 3yrs ago removed🤷The 76ers signed horny ass Danuel House?!?! Daryl Morey out here trying to recreate the Houston Rockets 2.0 in Philadelphia@ScooterMagruder The 1994 Houston RocketsI like the look of these Philadelphia Houston Rockets, but oh yeah, Tatum/Brown are cyborgs and they terrified me during the finals. 🫣Houston Rockets:

OVER 23.5 Wins. This team is bad but wins a few games they shouldn’t when the young guys go off

Best: Jabari Smith Jr. and Jalen Green are future superstars but they lose enough to add a 3rd star in the draft

Worst: 30 wins + we see why Jabari Smith fell to #3 https://t.co/J7TOXFAN0QJames Harden masterpiece getting wasted. Is this the Houston rockets?The Sixers offense reminds of the offense the Rockets ran in Houston, which is five-out isolation ball. That shit doesn’t work no more in the NBA. They are expecting him to do everything, and without ball movement. Make sure everyone touches the ball so no player is cold.@DerekBodnerNBA Switch Harris for PJ and trade Melton for Eric Gordon. Houston Rockets 2.0 baby!!!@IAM_TBreezy @Kevinporterjr @HoustonRockets @geniusandvanity Good DudeThis was my nephew’s reaction to .@Kevinporterjr hitting the game winning shot he was so excited!! 🫶🏼 🏀.@HoustonRockets
