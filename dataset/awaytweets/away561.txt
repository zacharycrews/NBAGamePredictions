With commentary from Matt Devlin. Co-commentator is Amy Audibert.  For more details see https://t.co/moQaFd40r3 #TorontoRaptors #SanAntonioSpurs #SportsNetCanadaHDThe Raptors -7 was a line we also looked at, which turned out to be a much better play. Unlike Ja’s points prop, the -7 was never really in doubt with Toronto winning by 25. Without Murray, the Spurs weren’t going to bring it tonight. Good eye, for those who took the Raptors@ClappedBK @Raptors Thai doesn’t countOne basic trait amongst good shooters: Their backspin. 

Proper rotation on the basketball after the shot is huge. It gives a direct correlation on how the ball is released from a player’s hands. 

A big concept focused on by Nick Nurse and the Toronto Raptors.@wacchi1013 @Raptors Hope you’re feeling ok.
