[via r/torontoraptors Mar 11, 2017 #Raptors]@Raptors That strut on point 👌🏾👌🏾Tonight @Raptors vs @Suns #NBA75@PackripEwing Anyone but Rafael Araujo for my beloved @Raptors.

Why?
Because he is himself, which is not great at basketball.In Game 3 of the Raptors series, the Sixers blew out Toronto at the Wells Fargo Center. Embiid was doing airplanes and the whole city thought it was wrapped up 

They lost the series.

Tonight was the complete opposite. It sucked, but don’t overreact@BobbySolez Hometown Toronto Raptors for life.

But player wise though... Ja Morant is so fun to watch.Shout out to all RAPSES, the parachuting training method, the off-the-grid electricity system, and the nickname for the Toronto Raptors.#Nets are still facing 10 of their last 15 games at home without Kyrie. They’re 2 games up on the 9/10. They’re 5 games back of CLE to escape the play-in. They’re 2 games back of the Raptors to avoid Toronto (no Kyrie) trip in the play-in. They have an uphill battle ahead of themWhat a ride that was, @Raptors https://t.co/Jez8YBnXVn@guidedbybrodie @TermineRadio @Raptors @BrooklynNets @NBAonTNT @sixers @ReggieMillerTNT @SiriusXMNBA The Nets will mop you@blazersforreal The Toronto RaptorsI swish like Toronto were the raptorsCustom Toronto Themed Bedroom
