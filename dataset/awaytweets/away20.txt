Milwaukee Bucks
Miami Heat
Chicago Bulls

Atlanta Hawks@BrooklynNets Petrovic was an amazing player and would have been remembered as one of the best shooters in NBA history.

Brought them up at -1.5 on the pod yesterday when they open at DK. Market move and Embiid injury makes it murky but overall better spot and matchup for the Nets in my mind.@NBA @BrooklynNets @sixers While these teams are so close they should just make Kyrie and Ben swap benches. 🤣@F1 @celtics @BrooklynNets @nyknicks Celtics and Timberwolves are fab. Knicks is awful 🙁@DylanFrew6 @isaiahthomas @BrooklynNets @KyrieIrving So as I said before clown, your metrics are crap not indicative of reality. Today a Brooklyn team with kyrie is more of a problem than the warriors were. A Celtics team with Tatum, Brown and a fully recovered Isaiah Thomas are a problem.

Hawks end up between 1 and 3 - prob 3. Get in playoffs, see what happens. Brooklyn flawed w/Harden(playoff failures), a crazy Kyrie, and bunch of guys thrown together w/KD(who is top 3 player in league). Bucks are tough. Bucks/Nets/Hawks are top 3 IMO.@BrooklynNets Lets Go NetsBrooklyn Nets vs Philadelphia 76ers 10/22/2021 Picks Predictions Previews

Phoenix Suns @ Los Angeles Lakers 9 pm ESPN@warriors This is some of the best passing as a whole squad I’ve ever seen…calling it now: @warriors 2022 NBA champs in 6 vs. @BrooklynNets@barclayscenter @youngthug @1GunnaGunna @BrooklynNets Slattt@NBA @Patty_Mills @BrooklynNets Win or lose@Awood732 @DYoffee @RealMichaelKay Lastly, the Brooklyn Nets got 3 Superstars/Future Hall of Famers &amp; the Barclay’s sounds like a Library inside of a Church. MSG is the greatest &amp; Knicks fans are some of the loudest &amp; def most loyal in the NBA, whether ppl like it or not…@DylanFrew6 @isaiahthomas @BrooklynNets @KyrieIrving Ur not listening at all. It’s pointless talking to you. Points decide the outcomes of games, not defensive rating. Even then being 10th out of 16 is nothing to boast about either. And no I don’t want the game to be soft, but it is what it is. DR is a metric. PPG is a stat.@tiffanee_dawn Trying to make it look like the Brooklyn Nets boo@_EnvyNoMan @papyfaye1 @ShamsCharania The game of basketball is a team thing like what are you getting at ?  With your logic all these players should be in a 1 on 1 league then or something, the fact that without kyrie last year in the playoff Brooklyn Nets could not beat the bucks, if kyrie played Nets would've wonThe Brooklyn Nets play today@josh2saint Sounds like his Brooklyn Nets team that he was with. 🤡@BrooklynNets A No brainer in my bookThe wait is over! @Bballforeverfb @NBAonTNT @BleacherReport @BR_NBA @ESPNNBA @NBA_Philippines @KDTrey5 @JHarden13 @BrooklynNets https://t.co/WjhLXgB2SV@BrooklynNets @KDTrey5 @JHarden13 @_claxton33 fighting@TheNBACentral Or he could've compared it to those Brooklyn nets teams he was on, those lakers atleast made the finals@Dominati_ @BrooklynNets Petition to support Kyrie : https://t.co/Q5pzTqVQ6e@LandonBuford @JCrossover @Bucks @Lakers @KyrieIrving @BrooklynNets My Lakers got alot to figure out before we can think about finals.

Poor Harden, too.@sidetalknyc How those gentrified Brooklyn Nets fans look at us 😂 https://t.co/t5I6Fbxxu0@BrooklynNets @KDTrey5 @JHarden13 @_claxton33 all the 5 starters in game 7 of last playoff were there, why Nash is trying a totally new thing? did not he try enough last season? how long can Nets let him learn to be a coach this way?Checking in with the Sharks and Bears game at the Art Hauser (thanks PA for the facebook stream)

Julia Cey had given P.A a 1-0 lead but Brooklyn Siemens tucked one in beside the net and tied the game up at 1

In 10 out of 20 years a team with subpar defense made it to nba finals out of the west and won 6 out of 10 times.I guess the NBA gave number 11 of the Brooklyn Nets the same treatment that Isiah Thomas got when it came to the Dream Team selection 🤣🤣🤣 #sportzbiznessTHIS AINT NO BROOKLYN NETS DEFENSE PAPO! @Bucks@Herring_NBA "Why couldn't they do this to the bucks in the playoffs last year?!?!?!?!?!?" - the brooklyn nets@BrooklynNets if kai don’t work out go get @Dame_Lillard@KobeFleming2 gonna be in Brooklyn so lotta nets fans too@DylanFrew6 @isaiahthomas @BrooklynNets @KyrieIrving The stats don’t back up your defense wins championships mantra about the type of team Brooklyn needs to be to win the finals. In other words with kyrie, the nets are a better offense than those golden state teams and that’s all they need to win it. The nba been soft for 20 years@EVRLAW @BrooklynNets no, ma’am, they’re losing their jobs in order to take a stand against medical malpractice and government tyranny.@iMColdtart @papyfaye1 @BleacherReport Then the Nets will trade him.

He's an adult, he's made the decision not to be vaccinated, he knows the consequence of that decision is unemployment.
