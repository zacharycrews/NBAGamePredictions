It's so annoying to buy food in airports.@SacramentoKings doing our Starbucks run, and and as always reppin our Kings.
#SacramentoProud https://t.co/po2NDlcTH3@SportsCenter 🏀 2002 WCF Game 6 Lakers  &amp; Donaghy vs. Kings. Sacramento was robbed of a title.@ken_triglia @hbarnes @SacramentoKings @DeuceMason @momoragan Pure dope bro love it!BTW, used to fly @SouthwestAir a couple times a month when my duty station was Sacramento. If you fly on SWA in uniform, they treat you like a king. It's actually a little embarassing for old guys, but it's good for the young troopers.@StocktonKings @SacramentoKings Still mad the team didn't stay in Reno and call themselves the Jacks@SacramentoKings It was one heck of a shot!@deafheaven @NDTalksBall @KateBDoll Yeah  the Sacramento Kings  are  the champions of being  ignored.@HiveCards @breakingbald2 Looking for some cool football or Sacramento kings cards https://t.co/xzppoMoM92@lead2324 @KyleDeming1 @SacramentoKings @nbatopshot @TyHaliburton22 Nice Giveaway TS: Draino@EllaHernangomez @MattyBforThree @SacramentoKings Trade him for who?@Twitch @SacramentoKings HOW COULD YOU@lead2324 @SacramentoKings @nbatopshot @TyHaliburton22 Love that man!
TS: jak12daxter@aaronhimself @BigRorDawg @JillAdge The same Vlade that drafted Bagley over Luka? He announced who he was picking before the draft with this picture. Zoom in. Vlade was a great Player for @SacramentoKings but was a lousy drunken GM. https://t.co/sESIuNQguy@SportsCenter Easy, 2002 @SacramentoKings getting the screw job by the refs in games 6 &amp; 7. The Robert Horry game 5 “wtf are you standing at the top of the key” tap back rebound 3 hurts too. The NBA knew what they did and didn’t let the team move- so I guess we got that 🤷🏽‍♂️@lead2324 @SacramentoKings @nbatopshot @TyHaliburton22 Amazing giveaway!

Let’s make this happen @mmcnair@MadMatt_G @SportsCenter @SacramentoKings Kings till I die. 916 rise up!!!@EssentialSNKRS @SportsCenter I was rooting for @SacramentoKings all the wayThe Dallas Mavericks are listing Kristaps Porzingis (low back tightness) and Sterling Brown (left ankle sprain) as questionable for Sunday’s game vs. the Sacramento Kings. Porzingis did not play in Friday's loss to the Denver Nuggets.Trade @BenSimmons25 to the @SacramentoKings for @buddyhield and @hbarnes.
