https://t.co/u5FrFCmcamJa Morant is a nightmare to guard because he has a freakishly quick first step, has a feel/handle/pace and pairs it with long arms and creativity. He has you guessing the whole time. Very few guys can completely dictate and manipulate a defender like this.

The Lakers are an absolute dumpster fire just two games into the season, as their new-look roster has looked incredibly out of sync. Grizz on the other hand is firing on all cylinders, and Ja Morant should show out once again here. #NBA https://t.co/MsA4YArBeJThough the Clippers fell to the Memphis Grizzlies last night, Paul George put on a special performance, reminding everyone that he is a future hall of famer.
