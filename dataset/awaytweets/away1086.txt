Last play of the night. Grizzlies are tough, but without Morant I think the Nets are in a good position to win this game. Toughest play for me all night, but I'm excited to watch and with Kyrie + KD playing for Brooklyn I love their chances.Let’s go !!!!!!! Man, if Brooklyn wins the chip!!!!! The entire city of New York will be cheering the nets on, during their playoff run!! https://t.co/g6yu0T8xst@mgbushwick1 @BrooklynNets Hoping to be there Sunday 🤞🏻🤞🏻Brooklyn now a legit contender to get to the Finals.

KD and Kyrie are the real deal. They can possibly get you a chip soon but the KNICKS will always be the real NY blue and orange team!!!@mjaff126 @BrooklynNets You did it@TheHoopCentral The Brooklyn Nets just added Kyrie Irving full time. Might want to reevaluate that TatooNYC is changing its #VaccineMandate rules to create an exemption for pro athletes—so that the few remaining unvaccinated #Mets &amp; #Yankees will be able to play home games. #KyrieIrving too, of course, for the #Nets in Brooklyn, but it was baseball that forced the change. https://t.co/SFbAFcMDafNets fans hype to see Brooklyn get eliminated again lol hate to see it , I’ll quote this again when it happens 😂😂😂😂😂So @espn @ESPNNBA has 2 games on tonight…one w/ @memgrizz &amp; one w/ @Lakers.

Morant isn't expected to return, which sucks because this had the makings of a classic. Brooklyn is a historically good team on the road, for obvious reasons. Memphis has shown they're formidable without Ja but this is too tall an order.

It let Garland be Garland. Which leaves the Cavs in an interesting position – Sexton's an RFA this summer (I think).

Since the Harden trade (which are the only stats that matter IMO) the Nets have an ORTG of 120.3 with KD on the floor, and Kyrie off. 

Since KD's return, Nets ORTG is 120 in home (!!) games.we need some more off the court content from the Brooklyn nets like those question games and shit ofc we love the on the court content but yk@TheNetsJunkie @BrooklynNets Break ?

I was looking at @nba careers, but didnt see what I wanted. Do you ever have openings for bookies for the @OfficialNBARefs? #GSWvsORLIt's no surprise that the Nets won't keep Drummond (albeit he's being far too honest in saying so), but he's right. Brooklyn needs Claxton. I know that I'm clearly biased, but after the last few games, I'm confident that everyone can see it.3-23-22 Picks
