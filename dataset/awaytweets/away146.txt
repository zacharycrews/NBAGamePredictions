Evan Mobley has 12 for Cleveland. Kid is lengthy, relaxed, and has a lot of potential. 
Regardless - New York NEEDS to break this game open soon. Shouldn’t be this close.2021-22 New York Knicks vs Cleveland Cavaliers | Halftime to Crunchtime | November 7th 2021 https://t.co/vfoDGUyzIc#New York Knicks - Cleveland Cavaliers ★ #2º cuarto terminado: 57 - 56 by: #SofaScore
