They begin a two-game road trip tonight in Denver. It marked just the third time in team history, and first since 1980, that Milwaukee went undefeated on a homestand of five or more games.@SnellSeason @Bucks Surely Connaughton and bud weren’t reasons we won a ring!@Bucks You spittin frI can’t wait to see the @Bucks play for the first time in person on December 12th.A delicious reminder that the Bucks are the reigning NBA Champs!
