Duncan Robinson was a Hauser before Miami gave both of them a huge hug and told them to shoot, shoot, shoot. They didn’t pull them because they missed a def rotation, they gave them 100% confidence, the key to everything in basketball.Cancel the season until the Miami Heat is 100% healthy@MiamiHEAT Who’s playing?@RussCarr3 I'm old enough to remember when the Miami Heat super team up was the only thing to worry about@Jyreecefeasts @MiamiHEAT good ratioMiami Heat vs. Detroit Pistons - NBA (12/19/21) | Tip-Off, How to Watch https://t.co/UOJEYtrefb@MiamiHEAT Bad coach@MiamiHEAT i‘d run into a brick wall for this dudeMiami Heat vs. Detroit Pistons - NBA (12/19/21) | Tip-Off, How to Watch https://t.co/TUCXjMwczs#MIAvsDET

#LEGENDoftheMiamiHEAT #NBA75@Rynge_ @WSOLogan I personally don't have a 'top 3' when it comes to a team winning a chip. Shane Battier wouldn't be classified as top 3 on Miami heat championship team.

Put your man love aside and be objective.@shadowbates @LilBartho @umichbball @MiamiHEAT Right now?

Miami could be an alternative destination, considering his ties to the Heat + the team is built to win now.

Bam would be moved to the C, Butler to SF, LBJ to PF, Herro to SG and Kyle Lowry to PG.

Cap space would need to be fixed tho.Miami Heat Coach @ErikSpoelstra_ in Ann Arbor supporting @JuwanHoward and the @umichbball team.. also @D_Bo20 was in attendance as well.
