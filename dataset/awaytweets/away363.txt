RJ wasn‚Äôt in any Top 100 player list or even Top 25 under age 25 list. 

I think we overrate RJ in comparison to how other teams and league views him.

I like RJ for what he is.it‚Äôs great if the @nyknicks win tonight but at this point I need a substantial win streak to believe we‚Äôre on a right track. 1 win ain‚Äôt cutting it sorryNew York is 30-11 ATS in its last 41 games when the line is +3 to -3.  The Knicks are 8-0 ATS in their last eight games after losing five or six of their last seven games coming in.Tuesday's Free Pick: New York Knicks -2.5

This looks like the spot the New York Knicks get back on track after three straight losses to three of the best teams in the NBA in the Nets, Bulls and Nuggets.  In fact, their last seven games have been against tough competition.New York Knicks üÜö

We need RJ to be a star, or have other teams think he is a star.

Everybody Has To Be Better.' ‚Äì NBA News https://t.co/qbCwfIkSBg@timelord_ts @nbatopshot @JLin7 @nyknicks @PackripEwing Linsanity will go down as one of the best moments for NY Knicks. I absolutely love this edit. Also the moment when he waved off Kobe and hit a 3 would be one of his best. @JLin7I should just become a bandwagon sports fan. Decades and decades of loyalty have gotten me nothing @nyjets @Mets @nyknicks https://t.co/VbAdSwHx1EOne week after he was benched and removed from the Knicks‚Äô rotation, Walker said he has no idea what comes next for him both in New York and beyond. Personally I wanna see ole boy get another shot at living his dream. Can't give up, never give up.@BabyJa83y @nyknicks They ain‚Äôt been shit since u been alive ion even know how u a fan üòÇ@burgosclan22 @livelikelefty @nyknicks @KembaWalker A statistical summary of why the Knicks pulled Kemba Walker from the rotation:

Knicks have the best defense in the league when he‚Äôs on the bench (99.0 DRtg) &amp; are dead last (116.3 DRtg) when he‚Äôs on the floor. 

They are 27th in offense with him playing, 9th with him off.@timelord_ts @nbatopshot @JLin7 @nyknicks @PackripEwing #Linsanity
Sick üî•@PlayoffBoundNYK @nyknicks Wish he would come back and we could trade Fournier for him@BuiBotOlolo @dannygzrcia @nyknicks Fournier does nothing else though.. just stands there and looks off teammates dribbling in the same spot and bad defender.

It would be a much much better fit in LA &amp; NY. @ShannonSharpe approves üòúI like @KembaWalker and want to see him succeed with the @nyknicks but his defense was as big a liability as his offense was an asset and his +/- couldn't continue. Instant offense off the bench when its needed might be a better roll for him. https://t.co/U3wCg4gXg2Probably like times by now lol @nyknicks #nyknicks https://t.co/Po5G8ONPFQ@nyknicks Maybe play team ball, like last season also trade for Elfrid@XXXCHINO99 @nyknicks Just as a reminder, we took Knox over him üòÇ@Freddybetta_23 @nyknicks Your team‚Äôs nickname is literally another man, L@Nardelli_M @nbatopshot @JLin7 @nyknicks @PackripEwing Thanks, my guy!@Scubba04 @wcknicks @nyknicks @deucemcb11 I was thinking the same thing.@aaronrift The New York Giants and Knicks@BPA_Ballerz @timelord_ts @nbatopshot @JLin7 @nyknicks @PackripEwing Legit üî•üî• On my Raptors too !!!

I feel bad for the talented rookies who'll be sucked into this cesspool.Knicks fans are largely stupid imo lol. I think NY sports fans in general are so insanely pessimistic and their negative energy is making every New York team bad. The only good New York team is the Buffalo Bills and that‚Äôs because their fans are die hard supportive.@nyknicks start Rose@nyknicks start rose@iohaneko @nyknicks Shit what about everyone else.

There are five other teams scoring less than 50% from inside; non of them are in the top 10 of either conference.Even though Lin, a former @nyknicks player was born and raised in California, he is of Taiwanese descent which prompted Enes Freedom to demand that Lin "Stand with Taiwan" and criticized him for going to play for China's Basketball Association@AlchemysBitch @NY_KnicksPR @nyknicks Way off.Kemba Walker uncertain on future, keeping heads high amid Knicks rotation absence #KembaWalker #NewYorkKnicks https://t.co/GtdjNrLjoAIt‚Äôs a long season @KembaWalker; as a @nyknicks fan I hope he gets his @TheGarden moment this year.
