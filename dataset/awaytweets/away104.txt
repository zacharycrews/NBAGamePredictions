Rudy dominated the Kings last time the teams faced off and I think he does again tonight.

Sure. What’s Fox excuse going into his 5th year? I love Fox but as more time goes by I’m starting to believe he’ll never improve his shooting. He is what he is at this point and that not good enough to be the #1 option especially in the 4th qNo new additions to Sacramento’s injury report for tomorrow vs Utah

Ramsey, Woodard, Queta &amp; King are all listed as unavailable (G-League).

Rudy Gay (heel) is out for the Jazz.Gripes I read today about why they keep choosing a city nickname for a… CITY jersey (instead of just “Kings”) got me thinking. Is it odd that we’ve had, what, 2 jerseys over 36 seasons that actually say the full “Sacramento” name? (Besides 1 Sac + 4 Sactowns) Not marketable? 🤷🏻‍♂️Special thanks to @macys the @Golden1Center team, @SacramentoKings, SD Visual Productions, and Macy's DOCO for making Pastor’s wish come to life this holiday season! 💙
