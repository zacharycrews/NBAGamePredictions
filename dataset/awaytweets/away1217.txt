If the Bucks lose as appears likely, the Bucks would be the thread seed if the Celtics won, no matter what Philly does.Well, Vegas expects Bucks to mail it in today. Cavs are 7.5-pt favorites.

Milwaukee loss puts the ball in Celtics' court. Would they prefer the 2-seed or playing Bulls/Raptors in 1st round?Reports say that Donte DiVincenzo wants out of the Kings Organization, Bucks fans do you thinks he want‚Äôs to come back to MilwaukeeüëÄ https://t.co/yq0JeobiS7Hey Milwaukee @bucks, it's CelticsForum.

Accordingly, the @Bucks are locked-in to the second seed regardless of the match up outcomes today.

There is no incentive for the @Bucks to win or lose today due to the fact that same holds tiebreakers over both @celtics and @sixers.

#NBA #Playoffs #BrooklynNets #Milwaukee #bucks@eric_nehm This is disappointing. It makes no sense to give away the 2 seed.
