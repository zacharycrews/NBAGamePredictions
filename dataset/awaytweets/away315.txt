Hello to everyone, except Warrior fansIf Wiggins can’t go, @warriors should seriously consider giving Kuminga the starting nod. Otto is still rounding into form physically; don’t compromise him while he isn’t 💯.

If Kuminga can mitigate fouls and turnovers, he can compete with anyone.

Ending it tonight would be good.

But can you imagine if the Warriors beat the Suns twice this week?
And then to follow up and beat them a 3rd time on Christmas? 

Demoralizing.

Not saying he can’t score. I’m saying play like he is rn. Not miss shots he normally drains. Look at 2016 finals when he choked a 3-1 lead.

The two teams play again on Friday.The #SITix @NBA matchup of the week is between the two hottest 🔥 teams in the league! The 18-2 @warriors head to Phoenix to take on the 17-3 @Suns Can MVP frontrunner @StephenCurry30 snap the Suns 16 game win streak?

And apparently, the Golden State Warriors are shooting 81% in the restricted area over their past 4 games???? What the heck.

Only one other team shoots better than 71% during this stretch, the Suns with 75%.

It shows up in other, more important things like Mikal being left off the defensive teams too.#NBA 🏀 Big Odds!

Now in MLB there’s been time a veteran has vetoed a minor league rehab. This is definitely great for the G League.@GoldenKnightGFX Golden State Warriors make the western conference finals but don't win the whole thing!!@warriors Poole, making a case to remain a starter or the same minutes coming off the bench.
