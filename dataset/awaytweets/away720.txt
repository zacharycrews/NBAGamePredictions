Because i have watched every single game he has played in his career since his first minute in the NBA, and watching him steadily improve and grow into his game (which was definitely too big for him in the beginning 😆) has been so rewarding. 😎🥰 #24sGirl https://t.co/smOf2QfHv8@thewingguru @memgrizz @JaMorant. It’s hard being a grizzlies fan. You hear so much negativity about your team and city. So when you have a player that invests his time and shows his sincerity for the city he plays in it help promotes  the spirit of the city.

My god how do you pick a fav out of that crew? Like picking your fav child! 🥰@thewingguru @memgrizz @DBane0625 because dude has the 3 shooting this franchise has needed since coming to Memphis!!!@thewingguru @memgrizz @JaMorant because he is a beast and can’t be stopped.@thewingguru @memgrizz @ashleyripple17  I gotta work this one but hope we can score some tickets to see @JaMorant  kill every record in the NBA@thewingguru @memgrizz @DBane0625, lights out shooter! https://t.co/qq70llz6oq@thewingguru @memgrizz My fav is @dillonbrooks24  every night you will get all he’s got. Offense and defense. He has a touch of grit and grind in along with that NXT GEN swagger.@BrianDeal @thewingguru @memgrizz @DBane0625 Them arms &amp; shoulders!!!@thewingguru @memgrizz @DBane0625 for suuuuuure!@YOLA901 @thewingguru @memgrizz @dillonbrooks24 is a THRILL to watch play! Plus so many other teams have fans that hate him… which is a plus! They know he’s a threat!@thewingguru @memgrizz @brandonclarke23 is my fav &amp; this video is the only explanation needed https://t.co/WRYYfQGls7@thewingguru @memgrizz My favorite got the smoothest jumper in the game @DBane0625. https://t.co/jNrTGEZ1zs@thewingguru @memgrizz @dillonbrooms because he has grown every year since he’s been in the league. Constant terror on defense and doesn’t shy away from guarding the Kobe’s (RIP) KD’s and Lebrons of the league@thewingguru @memgrizz James Posey will always be my favorite Grizz player. He was Grit and Grind before it was a thing. He was the glue on those trams that came from an undrafted player out of Xavier to a 2 time NBA champion and he did it in the Pyramid aka Bass Pro Shop@thewingguru @memgrizz @DBane0625 cause of his energy and 3 pt shootingCongratulations to parabellum (@parabellumTS) who moved up 4 spots to take #8 on the Memphis Grizzlies team leaderboard.

https://t.co/JSGB8JerPv@thewingguru @memgrizz Gotta love some @jarenjacksonjr What he has been doing on the court this year is SOLID and he is such a good guy. Love this team to the moon &amp; back! Love me some JJJ!!@mattcummings @OrlandoMagic @memgrizz Thought of driving?@thewingguru @memgrizz @JaMorant He's got that next gear that only the greats have and he's got a Mamba mentality with his approach to his game.

Dude is straight legit 🔥@thewingguru @memgrizz @JaMorant because he’s a Super Star!!@thewingguru @memgrizz @MacBo50 is my favorite grizzly of all time. Everything from the spurs series in 2011 to his last season with the Grizz in 2017 was awesome to watch.

I was sitting courtside and literally took one step forward. I was sober, I didn't argue with anyone, and did as I was told afterward. If Mr. Silver hadn't seen it, I probably wouldn't have been in as much trouble.@thewingguru @memgrizz @JaMorant got my 5 yo hooked on watching the game.@thewingguru @memgrizz My fav player is @JaMorant because he’s a great team player, represents the 901 with big heart, hustler for the win and a great father/role model for our future!@thewingguru @memgrizz @JaMorant so entertaining to watch!@thewingguru @memgrizz @konchjitty55 because of his 3 point shooting and defense.

Have a great broadcast.@thewingguru @memgrizz @jarenjacksonjr hands down! He really ushered in the "Nxt Gen Grizz" Era when he was drafted.

Win win either way@thewingguru @memgrizz @jarenjacksonjr is mine because he's the unicorn!🦄 (and also has good taste in wings)@doubleyouwest @memgrizz @GrizzOnBally Latest is Des is questionable.
