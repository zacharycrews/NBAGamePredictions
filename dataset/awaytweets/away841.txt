I believe in Simons being a better player for them than CJ was. Enough room to sign FA in the summer with the cap they freed up

Kings are going to be a scary team with Sabonis getting a bigger role than he had in Indiana. They win that trade imo🚨 Line Change 🚨

Been to hella games because they’re dirt cheap.  Very similar to the old Nets days.  Something about supporting a team that everyone sleeps on.  Nothing like it@CaliBoyRez @SacramentoKings Where did you get it?@SacramentoKings It’s not even 40% lol@SacramentoKings So bad it’s good@SacramentoKings Thanks for Tyrese 🤝@wihldrose @SacramentoKings And Bibby with the white headband@SacramentoKings i’m a fan of these jerseys.

This jersey is 🔥🔥🔥The owner of the Sacramento kings is not a king cause wtf@ChefTelmo @FestusEzeli @SacramentoKings They arent? Its impossible? Also a lot can change in 2 years, they shed buddy Heild &amp; Bagley, they have first their 1st round picks, I mean phx was bottom of the league 3 years ago &amp; in the play in 2 years ago. Hali wasnt winning here or contributing to wins. Had to make a move.@Pacers congrats, y'all got a nice start to your rebuild. @SacramentoKings y'all are dumb af@SacramentoKings Bring back these, and his socks https://t.co/DAGtyRfZfNPacers Announcer: "This is the most passing that I have seen Buddy do. He doesn't pass it a lot."

Sacramento Kings fans: "NO SHIT!!"@SacramentoKings Those are god awful. Stop.#TristanThompson has been traded to the #IndianaPacers along with two of his Sacramento Kings teammates amid reports that he's likely paying $120,000/month (which totals almost $1.5 million a year) in child support payments! 

Welp. He brought it on hims… https://t.co/r6vTRKrLuI https://t.co/B9IZBaKXVX@SacramentoKings @Divincenzo @DialpadHQ Too soon@ChefTelmo @FestusEzeli @SacramentoKings Love the concrete forecast. My God. Kings will have Bird Rights.  They’ll be able to pay the most if it goes well.  Players take the most money.  Maybe he’ll like CA.  People get on here and make arguments against their own guesses.@SacramentoKings The worst...@SacramentoKings Oh you got me with the Peja I can’t refuse@SacramentoKings As a non kings fan man I love it@SacramentoKings @Divincenzo @DialpadHQ haliburt0️⃣n 😔@gordonho560402 @SacramentoKings Vivek’s Daughter@Varitech @SacramentoKings 😆 man you’re tough sometimes. I’m a jersey wearer but pretty much just during the games. I don’t really wear any of my jerseys around otherwise.  My wife got me a Mostert jersey last Christmas. And of course he promptly goes out for the year Week 1. I told her to get Deebo.🤦🏻‍♂️@Mistahbroooooks @SacramentoKings @Divincenzo @DialpadHQ Shit we did to🥺 https://t.co/kIT5ubOcHmLet's go @TyHaliburton22 ! Sacramento Kings still rooting for you!Just want to say thanks, @SacramentoKings. #PacersGameNight https://t.co/OtHIw4WxpR@SacramentoKings @TreyLyles Pleas @TreyLyles and @swipathefox run before it's to late!! The fall of Kentucky players there is pitiful. Please run as far as you can.@Varitech @SacramentoKings So you think there comes a point where a person just becomes too old to wear a jersey.  Do you feel that way about all jerseys or just basketball?@SacramentoKings @j_josh11 @DialpadHQ There's only one 55 https://t.co/Dc7Ctu38Df@SacramentoKings @Divincenzo @DialpadHQ JK y’all 😭
