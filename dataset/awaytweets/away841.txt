A mediocre at best player, couldn‚Äôt stay healthy,  represented a terrible mistake. You can get a good bench guard for that, you take it. We also never had Divecenzo so we‚Äôre not getting him ‚Äúback‚Äù@SactownKingsFan @SacramentoKings @TheCityofSac @mmcnair I was talking to my rep about a ‚Äústate of the franchise‚Äù event several months back.

Also a lot can change in 2 years, they shed buddy Heild &amp; Bagley, they have first their 1st round picks, I mean phx was bottom of the league 3 years ago &amp; in the play in 2 years ago. Hali wasnt winning here or contributing to wins. Had to make a move.@Pacers congrats, y'all got a nice start to your rebuild. @SacramentoKings y'all are dumb af@SacramentoKings Bring back these, and his socks https://t.co/DAGtyRfZfNPacers Announcer: "This is the most passing that I have seen Buddy do. He doesn't pass it a lot."

Sacramento Kings fans: "NO SHIT!!"@SacramentoKings Those are god awful. Stop.#TristanThompson has been traded to the #IndianaPacers along with two of his Sacramento Kings teammates amid reports that he's likely paying $120,000/month (which totals almost $1.5 million a year) in child support payments! 

Welp. He brought it on hims‚Ä¶ https://t.co/r6vTRKrLuI https://t.co/B9IZBaKXVX@SacramentoKings @Divincenzo @DialpadHQ Too soon@ChefTelmo @FestusEzeli @SacramentoKings Love the concrete forecast. My God. Kings will have Bird Rights.  They‚Äôll be able to pay the most if it goes well.  Players take the most money.  Maybe he‚Äôll like CA.  People get on here and make arguments against their own guesses.@SacramentoKings The worst...@SacramentoKings Oh you got me with the Peja I can‚Äôt refuse@SacramentoKings As a non kings fan man I love it@SacramentoKings @Divincenzo @DialpadHQ haliburt0Ô∏è‚É£n üòî@gordonho560402 @SacramentoKings Vivek‚Äôs Daughter@Varitech @SacramentoKings üòÜ man you‚Äôre tough sometimes. I‚Äôm a jersey wearer but pretty much just during the games. I don‚Äôt really wear any of my jerseys around otherwise.  My wife got me a Mostert jersey last Christmas. And of course he promptly goes out for the year Week 1. I told her to get Deebo.ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è@Mistahbroooooks @SacramentoKings @Divincenzo @DialpadHQ Shit we did toü•∫ https://t.co/kIT5ubOcHmLet's go @TyHaliburton22 !

The fall of Kentucky players there is pitiful. Please run as far as you can.@Varitech @SacramentoKings So you think there comes a point where a person just becomes too old to wear a jersey.  Do you feel that way about all jerseys or just basketball?@SacramentoKings @j_josh11 @DialpadHQ There's only one 55 https://t.co/Dc7Ctu38Df@SacramentoKings @Divincenzo @DialpadHQ JK y‚Äôall üò≠
