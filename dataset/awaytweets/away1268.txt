However, we expect Toronto to cover the lofty 8-point spread on the back of Pascal Siakam, who should pick up the slack against the 76ers.

🔴𝐋𝐢𝐯𝐞 𝐋𝐢𝐧𝐤 𝐎𝐧📺 @nbaplayoffs222 https://t.co/sQSc4svu4JThe Toronto Raptors are fighting to become the 1st team in NBA history to erase a 3-0 series deficit against the 76ers. 

My @OntarioBets preview of tonight's Game 5 is live here: 

https://t.co/wjVAMDxPsi@JoeAMacDonald @OpenGymAnunoby @russwest44 @Raptors No .. James Harden and Ben Simmons are cancers. Westbrook was given poor plays that were written and executed for LBJ and AD. He's a small ball player, just like the Raptors play. He'd fit in well I betThe Philadelphia 76ers (-7.5) will look to end the series tonight at home against the Toronto Raptors (+250)

🏀Philadelphia has won their last 5 home games
🏀Toronto is 1-5 ATS in their last 6 games
🏀The total has gone under in 4 of the Sixers' last 6 games against the Raptors https://t.co/dSMWEyDIiN@BlakeMurphyODC I hope @Raptors will be able to stretch the series 😭😬🙏🏼🔴𝐋𝐢𝐯𝐞 𝐋𝐢𝐧𝐤 𝐎𝐧📺 @nbastreamshdtv

P.S. @Raptors admin got a good excuse to get me out of work?Fred Van Fleet is injured @Raptors who caresGame number two going up is Raptors-76ers. Joel Embiid's thumb is still an issue, but Philly's injury luck is still way ahead of where Toronto is at with FVV out and Scottie at 75% health.

Are the Sixers taking it all or are they going to game 6? #playoffsNBA #NBA@BleacherReport Well, this could be it for the @Raptors .@JeffBullzos @Raptors @JHarden13 @nbatopshot TS: jared3

@afriend8888When Drake attended a Toronto Raptors game with his son Adonis he wore a nice pair of Nike Air Zoom Flight 95s (an iconic basketball shoe from the 90s) in black &amp; silver. More recently he wore an unreleased white &amp; silver version! https://t.co/sULp7RYMOp#FredVanVleet has been a liability on defence &amp; his offense has been inconsistent in this #Toronto series vs the #Sixers.

It's a good thing if he can't play in Game 5. The problem though is it puts pressure on #PascalSiakam who straight up sucks. Can he deliver a win? #Raptors https://t.co/6JRwg6FmZ2@akurjata An example of this is when the Raptors won, but in their playoff run their slogan was “We the North”. Toronto, as I am sure we can all agree, is not North. But they feel North during those playoffs because they are the northernmost NBA team.@R_G_Mercs @NBA @evanmobley @cavs @Raptors Man if yall don't win tonight that whole stadium gone switch sides 🤣 https://t.co/HPnnkpsFRm@JeffBullzos @Raptors @JHarden13 @nbatopshot TS: EWal

Toronto Raptors  2019-2020
Miami Heat          2004-2005
LA Lakers             2002 NBA FinalsICYMI: I wrote about the 76ers-Raptors game over the weekend. Toronto's bench showed up in a big way and made up for Fred VanVleet's absence. Will Nick Nurse get more production from his reserves in Game 5 tonight or will the Sixers close out the series?

Release this swag to the public. Give the People what they Want!!!@JJ_From_Jerz @NekiasNBA but they might have to problem Philly first or Toronto since Miami is the #1 seed while 76ers is #4 and the Raptors in #5, which, the winner of the Philly-Raptors series will face Miami if they win though...lets not get ahead of ourselves...@Raptors don't win their championship without trading him, but man do I miss JV. Love watching him succeed in the playoffs.Honestly, Toronto. The Raptors are fun to watch, the Blue Jays are filthy, &amp; the Maple leafs are a blue blood in hockey. If it wasn’t houston it’d be Toronto for me https://t.co/tc9SKbsFf0@MixieGeneral @davwain1 @Raptors @sixers @JoelEmbiid Dude@PlayStationCA @Raptors #2022playofftailgate #PlaystationCA Seeing Kyle Lowry, the greatest raptor of all time return home[Charania] Toronto Raptors‘ Scottie Barnes has won the 2021-22 NBA Rookie of the Year via /r/nba https://t.co/FBK7I9F7dW@MixieGeneral @davwain1 @Raptors @sixers @JoelEmbiid Oh I just got info on tsn. Embiid has a broken thumb. He can't use his hands to defend himself. Not looking good for 76ers@WorimiFella @NBA @Raptors Fouls and violations etc should be black and white. If the officiating went back to the basics and called a travel and travel and foul a foul, this league wouldn’t have so many games decided by the whistle.@KateBDoll @Raptors Absolutely!!!! 🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾@heyhalima @Raptors Honestly it would get so chaotic I need it@WorimiFella @NBA @Raptors The NBA is the only sports association in the world where rules aren’t black and white. A foul is only a foul if the player has earnt the call. How long has he been in the league? what’s his star power? Is he on the road or at home? Does he have more experience than the opponent?Raptors really only have to win the next game in Philly and they’ll lock up the series. They’ll win again in Toronto, and by game 7 all the momentum will be with them. Embiid will be banged up and mentally broken. Not to mention Doc coaching. It’s a perfect storm for Raps to win.I pray to god that the @Raptors win tomorrow! Something doesn’t feel right about the SIXERS and I think that the Raptors could very well take advantage of it! Retweet if you agree!🔥🤞👀‼️@EVRYDAYCarter Thank you to the Toronto Raptors for
taking Scottie Barnes at #4, without
you, the Orlando Magic could've
never drafted Jalen Suggs at #5.

https://t.co/f35KLNLhjkRiddle me this: How does a team only give up 2 FT’s in an entire half in the modern game? The answer is due to very subjective refereeing. The @NBA is a broken, inconsistent product. I hear you @Raptors fans. #NBAPlayoffs #Suns@SherAndLil @Raptors @ScottBarnes561 @caseybannerman This is an awesome jersey 🔥🔥From @HelloooJack &amp; @coryworon: The Raptors avoided the sweep by besting the 76ers in Toronto, but as the games shift back to Philadelphia, and potentially without Fred VanVleet in the line up, what will be the key to keeping their season alive? https://t.co/62KVvs10Mm https://t.co/9XrYcxhgw3Hey #Raptors fans!

Check out this SICK jersey being released April 25 in honour of @Raptors very own @ScottBarnes561 winning 2022 #NBA #KiaROY Rookie of the Year.

Basketball I don't even watch@MixieGeneral @davwain1 @Raptors @sixers @JoelEmbiid Speed vs slow. Raps are better.@Anthonysmdoyle All I'm saying is that you can't write off a team because they lost a home game early in R1 to an inferior team.  The Raptors lost game 1 at home to Orlando their title year.  The Pelicans are better than that Magic team, and Toronto's best player didn't get hurt.@MixieGeneral @davwain1 @Raptors @sixers @JoelEmbiid Like I said with embiid. He won't be able to do that dirty shit. Putting out Barnes.

How many of those guys did it in only 3 quarters? Kobe dropped 81 against the in your words “rat” Toronto Raptors.

Go raptors!

🦖🦕@NBA @NBAFantasy @Raptors I think Toronto is still a sleeper in this series if Embid's thumb does not hold up well! I don't trust Harden one bit! #SorryNotSorry@Raptors please extend that series at least another game so KLow can get some more rest lolAgain, I'm feeling good about the Toronto Raptors right now.

Lose tomorrow with a valiant effort, and I reflect highly on an incredible season with a ton of memorable moments.

Win, and Twitter burns to the ground as I light a cigar over its glowing flames.@TrillFrrr Toronto Raptors*@bubba_dubbs824 @Paul__Jones @Raptors That's how we do! 😁When you win @NBA #NBAROY #rookieoftheyear.

Thad rocks!The Sixers fell behind by double digits in the first half of both games in Toronto because they struggled on offense and allowed the Raptors to play to their strengths, writes @ginamizell.

You guys are done in 5After a stop-start performance versus the Toronto Raptors in Game 4, Tyrese Maxey needs to be the Philadelphia #76ers' offensive focal point moving forward.

Are you doing anything about this?toronto raptors a bunch of morons@dekker @ScottBarnes561 @Raptors Congratulations Scottie well deserved@rapsmuse_nba @pskills43 @Raptors Ah yes, the other 35 point game was Game 7 vs Miami. That game was an all around masterclass from Kyle. Thanks for acknowledging the typo.@EricPincus Fans always including THT's name in trades like they have forgotten the Lakers GM refused the Toronto Raptors request for THT in a trade for 2019 NBA Champion Kyle Lowry.  Westbrook trade benefits THT greatly.
