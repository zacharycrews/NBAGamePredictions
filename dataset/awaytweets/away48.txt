Like, here's a gif for proof, @BleacherReport https://t.co/oT8tCpgecG https://t.co/RYFmXsDXml@mcten @KingJames you must forgot about the @trailblazers cause they been chasing him for the longest and revived his career. #DamianLillard played a huge part in bringing him back. I hope he gets his first ring this year doe.The Celtics are ranked 19th in @ESPN's new power rankings:

16. Washington Wizards
17. Portland Trail Blazers
18. LA Clippers
19. Boston Celtics
20. Minnesota Timberwolves
21. Indiana Pacers
22. Toronto Raptors@BleacherReport Reminder that Carmelo Anthony played for the @trailblazers for the past two seasons. The @trailblazers wanted him.

During that time, he scored 1,819 points in the regular season -- enough for him to move past 10 players on the all-time scoring list.

But, yes, rah rah @Lakers 🤷‍♂️@BleacherReport He scored 32 points for the @trailblazers though...Paul George is off to a great start, but it looks like the Clippers may be in a tough spot until Kawhi returns. Can they get their 1st win of the season tonight against the visiting Blazers? #NBA #NBAPicks #RipCity #ClipperNation @trailblazers @LAClippers https://t.co/uWYfKJCboi@NBATV @trailblazers @LAClippers Why so late man folks got work@GoldGloveTV @trailblazers Davis specifically references that and I don't think LeBron meant after last season.  I think he meant before the Blazers gave him a shot.Love @KingJames , but you were one of the people who didn’t reach out. @trailblazers were the ones who gave him that opportunity, only ones that didn’t up on him https://t.co/ANqbt5HfBlWhat's your favorite nickname for Jusuf Nurkic?

@bosnianbeast27? How about when @kevincalabro
 calls him the “Dancing Bear?” That’s our favorite.  

We protect bear habitat in the Bull Run Watershed like Nurk protects the rim.

So @trailblazers  fans where you at?!?! #RipCityGetting really annoyed with the bad reporting by @NBA media regarding @Dame_Lillard. A recent piece on #Blazersedge suggests the @trailblazers have only this yr to convince him to stay. Its BS What else does he have to say to further deny that? “I an not leaving Portland” seems
