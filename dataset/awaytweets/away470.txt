#NBA #espn #programmer #stock"Draft the best player, not the best fit"

Detroit Pistons have Killian Hayes and Cade Cunningham. Assuming they get to pick #1 again next year and the consensus best player in the draft is a point guard, should they also select that one too?@SouthBeachMamba @DetroitPistons @Ticketmaster Appreciate it bro 👌🏾#MIAvsDET

His @DetroitPistons team WAS good...WAS great...until they met adversity.

Then, it was anything goes.

Zeke was my favorite point guard until they showed they were sore losers. 

That's when MJ became my fav player. When I saw the work he put in to win. https://t.co/7b4PWMkbHm https://t.co/nPd3TDS6NaConsensus Line Move:
