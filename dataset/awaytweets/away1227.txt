LETS WIN THIS! 💪🏻💪🏻@70files @warriors cornballPeople talk about the Knicks’ draft slip ups all day long and I’ve seen no mention of how the Golden State Warriors took James Wiseman instead of Obi Toppin to compliment Steph Curry in his prime - and on purpose@warriors w lineupLet’s get it @warriors https://t.co/qcJiUNwqqg@warriors why does Moses either start or not play at all? give my man some more consistent play time@KawhisFavBurner @warriors Enjoy this ratio https://t.co/0vBMjWOeKF@warriors Good contentThe case for the Golden State Warriors is very simple:

Steph + Draymond = Greatness

But there's plenty more to like. Including the fact that the Warriors waited all season to get Klay back... and may have gotten something even better.

You’ll kill Utah and have a better chance against Suns than we do 😂I’m a little worried about the results of the Dallas and Golden State games. But the good thing is that the Warriors are definitely going to be trying to get that 3 seed. Them falling to 4 is a nightmare scenario for Utah. I’m guessing the Jazz will finish 5th, not 6th.@KawhisFavBurner @warriors Ratio@warriors LETS GET IT DONE.@warriors Let’s get this dub tonight@warriors When curry coming back?@warriors Klay needs 29 to be 20.0PPG@warriors Maryland 💙Calling all @warriors fans…do y’all think #Poole should be benched when @StephenCurry30 returns? 
I don’t think Poole should be benched. Coach Kerr has a hard decision to make, I do know that.

@KlayThompson needs to get atleast 29 points today in the @warriors vs @PelicansNBA @NBA final regular season matchup to take his season ppg to 20. He is currently at 19.7

Answer: Golden State WarriorsWhat we do know is that the Nuggets will finish with either the No. 5 or No. 6 seed in the Western Conference playoffs, with either the Dallas Mavericks or Golden State Warriors waiting for them in the first round. https://t.co/RsQJfxeI7w@NBA @juanonjuan10 @warriors Happy birthday Juan@warriors @Invisalign Its totally fine if we lose tom@NBA @juanonjuan10 @warriors Thought he was like 25 or sumn@NBA @juanonjuan10 @warriors don’t care@AndyTassara If they play that series 100x golden state win 99 of them.

Bring home the Dub! https://t.co/qRdWhtsYuv@warriors We run cali@YC_0015 @NullaDeNiente @warriors As the commentator said, he is far more focused on facilitating the ball and involving his teammates in actions, we have scorers, he will score when needed, Team's are actually respecting him and putting a body or two on him so he can facilitate easily now and take advantage.@warriors Please Win.  PleeeeaaaseWould be rookie Kuminga the next Dray for @warriors?...👀🤔 https://t.co/8SunOLROrd@YC_0015 @flowerhakeen @warriors @NBCSAuthentic well he has been playing near 40 min per game since steph went out lol and with so many back to backs, ofc he's tired. not to mention he's taken on a lot of steph's off ball movements which are exhausting. he'll be fine@baby_face_goat @warriors No not frank lol get freedom@warriors Warriors to the NBA once steph gets back https://t.co/71B83S93Un@warriors how hasn't poole scored yetfirst half ✔️ https://t.co/2Lt7QfmGZR@warriors Love Poole’a playmaking but tell him to score more I think he is to focused on playmaking.@kemet2000 @warriors Could be a fun series.@ItsKasshh @warriors I feel like he kinda seem like he been focusing more on the play making this pst 2 games@warriors poole put all his effort into playmaking today huh@NullaDeNiente @warriors More like doubting to shoot or not...Literally that first half looked like the JP of the half of the season, I mean look I’m just judging the first half we’ll see how he is when the game finishes@warriors Is he taking his pulse? Alive &amp; well.The 2017 Golden State Warriors would’ve ran the 96 Bulls and the 01 Lakers out the gym https://t.co/YMJRKD4Abg@warriors Poole's shot isn't there tonight, but his playmaking is elite@warriors Moody play time? 💀🤦‍♀️@baby_face_goat @WheresTheBall97 @warriors Steve kerrorist won’t let that happen sadly@Buttfrags @warriors So if he’s injured why he playing?@warriors LEEEETS GO@warriors Poole slippin but that's cool kuminga got it@warriors Gotta keep hustling and fighting we got this #DubNation@TAYT99 @warriors His hand got injured last game a bit.

That's what he needs to do@warriors Warriors try not to foul challenge: https://t.co/pn3YfjZWAQ@warriors poole fg percentage https://t.co/r9Efnm9rPc@warriors Although he's hesitant to shoot after missing all FG so far it's nice to see the assist game from JP reminds me of Steph drawing the D in for a trap.@WheresTheBall97 @warriors Don’t care release Lee#NBA75 | Final 2C ⏱️

Tattoo (you) on his arm? #DubNation@warriors I’m just assuming Poole finna drop 20 in the second half@warriors Poole needs to be better 0-7 0-4 at half@warriors can't believe Kerr was trying to hide kuminga from the world@warriors Just a vibe like 0-5 at three don’t got no points is crazy@warriors Release Lee and get kaminsky@warriors Idk why kerr risking JP playoff performance for a useless game. If he’s not 100% take him out@warriors play moody@warriors vs @spurs

@JenaiaNicole @shemaiahonthebt https://t.co/XkGWcsLw8F@warriors Poole stop passing too much!@warriors Solid first half@warriors Should be more but okay@warriors Jordan Poole needs to lock in :(@warriors Ok now I’m getting a bit worried maybe I’m a bit paranoid, but does JP seem tired, hopefully it is that and not that he has cooled down after the run he just had like 0pts in 1st half and also doubting...Anyway hopefully it’s all good he’ll have time to rest a bit before playoffsKeep winning @warriors and maybe we won’t have to beat you tomorrow night.@warriors Draymond took that fade middy from LeBron 😂😂😂 ultimate klutch employee@flowerhakeen @warriors @NBCSAuthentic Nah he’s been looking tired since the Kings games, with this one 3 games now...Idk man hopefully is that he just tiredWith Spurs resting players tonight, Warriors gonna pick up a win that A) well, gets them a win, and B) locks New Orleans into No. 9

All of a sudden the Jazz are favorites to play Dallas, not Golden State at this point.@KingsRatio @warriors @NBCSAuthentic Idk but if his hand messed up idk why they have him in anyway. Risking his playoff performance for a useless gameOMG DRAYMOND WTF ARE YOU DOING !!! STOP PASSING UP LAY UPS!!
