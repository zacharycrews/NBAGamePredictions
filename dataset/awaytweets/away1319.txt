And especially when they played vs. Warriors. And they also got every call. Watched many games live, back when all you needed to know to get in the games was the security guard. Lifelong @warriors fan here 🙋🏾‍♂️@warriors I've been impressed by Porter; he doesn't seem intimidated by being in the finals. Payton looks good and, of course, Iguodala, he's the proven mastermind for all these guys!@warriors Iggy can sit out and assist the coaching staff to read the game that would be so helpful.@mycousiinvinny_ @skyy37776777 @warriors There’s multiple strategies, and that’s a thing we love about it!

Question 2 = B - Celtirs@WAD1980 @S2NFL @warriors @celtics I absolutely respect BOS too, especially Tatum. BOS defense is indeed problematic. Before series I thought Warriors would slow down BOS offense more effectively than BOS shutting off Warriors’. BOS got open looks/made shots G1.

Now, I just need to get to one of the games.@tobkrom05 @NBATV @warriors @mikecwright They should’ve but that’ll never be the case. Tatum is way better than Looney.

Here’s a recent sentence from CBS Sports about the Golden State Warriors in the NBA Finals:

“They went on to coast to a 107-88 victory, and they tied the series up at 1-1 in the process.”

Can you tighten that sentence by removing at least five words?4 years ago today...

The Warriors sweep the Cavaliers to win their 3rd Championship in 4 years 🏆

Golden State's preseason odds to win the title were an absurd -187 😳

Is that not accurate, or do the Warriors just have a ton of anniversaries?get that church money tonight. @warriors@NBATV @warriors @mikecwright ain't no way u guys snuck in Poole like that 💀@S2NFL @warriors @WAD1980 I’m a hoop fan first, Dubbs fan 2nd. I gave BOS all the credit for taking G1. G2 BOS simply got outplayed and lost by ~20. To lay that at the feet of refs appears more biased than what you’re accusing refs of. Would love any examples to support your views if you have’em tho.Okay man!!!!

It’s impossible to open up a cheque book, sign all the good players and win. Even if you signed two stats (Brooklyn), you run out of money quick 

Warriors have drafted supreme (Steph, Klay, Dray, Loon, Poole etc)@doubledworth This is the attitude we need to bring all night long @warriorsmy boyfriend took the time and had the patience to teach me about basketball and his love for the Miami Heat and I turned out to be a Golden State Warriors fan ✌🏼✌🏼@mulhollanddrove@dubsferrari @warriors You're absolutely welcome 😊@chizarone GM! I am &amp; I hope that you're well. That's not a take --- it's a fact. This series is tough for anyone to watch if you're not a @warriors fan like yourself. You should look at film of the past 2 games from a different viewpoint rather than that one of a fan. @WAD1980NBA Finals Odds!

Only Steph is actually worth mentioning. Not offense to Poole, but if he is there, should be Wiggins too. He was primary Tatum defender.@dsmooth210 @SportsGrind @jarkclonas @biggestpuma @SBJ Golden State Warriors leads the league in Local TV ratings and it ain't a one pro sports town.  I'm sure there are lots of things to do in No Cal just like in LAC amdd BRN. Bottom line fans will support a winner....on TV and at the games.@NBA @Money23Green @warriors Everyone and Celtics fans were calling the Celtics "bad boys pistons" defense but they keep crying when Draymond gets physical.

Wiggins disrespect. I hope things like this do not turn him into ball hog. Also, Curry deserves to be #1, even in Game 1.@NBATV @warriors @mikecwright I love you, Poole, but you shouldn't be in this list realistically speaking.@stlouieram @warriors "Can't win a home game"? Warriors down 55 points one game in the last round, still won the series. ONE home game loss so far in the playoffs. Celtics, have lost 3 home games so far in the playoffs. Look at Warriors home game record in playoffs over the years. I like their chances@Sixth_Castle @Joseph1994726 @stellarct @icesynnn @NBATV @warriors @mikecwright Saying steph and D loses all credibility. Nice try.

https://t.co/movuzuXiLrI would like the Dubs to prove their doubters wrong by winning the Finals in 5 games.  So many said basketball experts saying Golden State has are no match to Boston, they do not respect the Warriors' greatness. https://t.co/ctJi5xIA8i@Sixth_Castle @Dmonz21 @Joseph1994726 @icesynnn @NBATV @warriors @mikecwright Lol and Theis has been our worst defender on the floor. Even Poole was getting cooked@Dmonz21 @Joseph1994726 @stellarct @icesynnn @NBATV @warriors @mikecwright 1. Wiggs had 3 blocks and a steal in game 1; only Robert Williams has had more blocks in a game so far with 4. 
2. Wiggs, Steph, Poole, and Draymond all have better defensive ratings in these playoffs than every Celtics player besides Theis so….@Young4Blood2 @LiyahJayee @warriors They’re not locking Klay up like they’re looking Steph up though and Steph is playing brilliant.. Klay has just been poor and he know that, she’s correct, both Klay &amp; Poole need to step upno. 2

Keep that intensity every game, all game, as the Celts were tired by the 4th.

So proud.
I have nothing to do with Poole, I love that young guy but Wiggins must be there. He's consistency for two games in these series must be recognize.Brooklyn didn’t play it’s hand well enough when Golden State asked for the sign and trade. 

The Warriors were clearly the most desperate party all they had to give up was a top 20 protected 1st that became a 2025 2nd? Also, why didn’t Minny compete with that lol.@NBAMuse24 @warriors @WarriorsMuse @OnBallSteph @ramon_rican @StatMamba @SplashBrosMuse @antonin_org @GoIdenState My man is 34@KateRoyce76 @warriors None of the guys here are former Cs or locals.

Gm1 - Boston was able to attack early in shot clock, finding penetration + pitch rhythm 3's or layups.
