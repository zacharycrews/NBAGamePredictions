Priority numero uno for next year's Bulls season has to be health. https://t.co/QuZo9eoETw@voriskes @windycitybulls @chicagobulls At least they beat Boston and almost won a close one last game with no Lavine Caruso or Ball. Way things been going right now who knows but from past matchups that gives us most hope@chicagobulls Chicago Frauds (0-16 against good teams)0 women but I have Chicago bulls and Pulisic ball to watch at 1am and 3amOne more play for tonight. Took this and I also sprinkled Lavine 28/ Bulls W. Good bounce back spot for chicago and no Derozan I’m expecting Lavine to step it up tonight.

I don’t believe we were frauds when everyone said we were, but now we’re playing into the Fraud stuff by losing games we shouldn’t lose and still not beating contenders.

(1996) In their 1st season as an NBA franchise, the Toronto Raptors beat the eventual champions, the Chicago Bulls 109-108. Chicago, led by Michael Jordan, would only lose 10 games during the ‘95-‘96 season. The 2nd lowest mark in NBA history. https://t.co/ebzDeJZufbHappy Zach LaVine got his bag but New Balance makes dad shoes.

That would be my guess - the national packages protect the local rightsholders. If the Bulls are playing on NBA TV, you can't see the game on that network in Chicago - have to go to the RSN@kirkgoldsberry @cavs @Timberwolves @memgrizz @celtics @BrooklynNets @nyknicks @Lakers @trailblazers @Raptors @chicagobulls Over half the teams are worse. That's coolNets previous high for points scored on their birthday was 41 points set by Allen Crabbe on his 26th birthday on 4/9/18 vs. Chicago Bulls. https://t.co/U7bFJGn2Xn@ChiSportUpdates The fact that DeMar never gets injured, and the first time he does is on the Chicago Bulls tells everyone what they should already know: the Bulls are cursed😞wishing you the best DeMar, Zach, and Lonzo🙏🏾Miami Heat joining the Chicago Bulls as all-fraudulentThe greatest of all tine .A great era!!!.@Chicagobulls  Dont let me find my 72-10 shirt from the following season ! https://t.co/oRdZXCdXVU1986 fleer nba chicago bulls mi #tradingcards https://t.co/MnkT9jhVlU@chicagobulls @BCBSIL commentThe Sad Truth About the Chicago Bulls
https://t.co/bQANiE8Jzo@AcunaPlusButler @BuildLinval @HolidayJrueTime @chicagobulls @HorizonNews This comment shows you don’t know shit about this team@JMads34 @ESPNNBA The Chicago Bulls are the Dallas Cowboys of the NBA. Same overexposed logo used by people who aren't anywhere near the city, same struggles against actually good teams, same multiple championships those of a certain age will remember https://t.co/nO8h1N3kPHPlease stay in the top 6 please! @chicagobullsAlright #BullsNation, if we are able to get Anthony Davis but have to give up some of our key players, would you do it? Who would you offer? #chicagobulls https://t.co/J5idMZRwjIYeaaahhh.......yall see dis right? Lolz @chicagobulls https://t.co/X0Wfa0Tw4n@chicagobulls is there anywhere I can buy a jersey for a 6 year? I think a youth small will be too big@chicagobulls @SamSmithHoops Derozan is the best thing that happened to the bulls in years@Crazedrat1 @chicagobulls @SamSmithHoops Bulls beat the Nets with both durant and harden playing@bennythebull I ❤️ the @chicagobulls mascot Go Benny Go. I had a great time at the game 💯 https://t.co/MQeoGlQCFB@HelloTh09540196 @BenjiCalavera @chicagobulls @SamSmithHoops They trolling the bulls, that's don't matter we beat the Nets with durant and harden playingShaq should’ve been at this game after he spewed nonsense saying we’re inconsistent, the Jays still have bad habits playing iso ball and compared us to the 0-16 against top teams Chicago Bulls last night 😒It sucks the bulls can’t beat top teams but this the most fun basketball has been for Chicago in half a decade so who cares@julia_azari Would you like to borrow my 1998 Chicago Bulls DVD?Check out 1994 UD DECADE OF DOMINANCE RARE AIR MICHAEL JORDAN 5 CARD LOT #ChicagoBulls https://t.co/kA7ijaifl9 via @eBay@nataliereed84 just for 30 years.

Also, the Chicago Bulls are the Goff clan@kirkgoldsberry @cavs @Timberwolves @memgrizz @celtics @BrooklynNets @nyknicks @Lakers @trailblazers @Raptors @chicagobulls I’m not surprised with #BrooklynNets  ranking but I do not think it’s indicative of how good the team is. They’ve had a very messed up season and are poised to redeem themselves in the final stretch.Craig Hodges not being in #TheLastDance is very offensive to the legacy of the Chicago Bulls.@ThisLeague23 I don't think that's a crazy thing to say! Bulls just take care of business against bad teams, which the Hawks can't seem to do. I do think Chicago's perimeter defense is better when healthy which makes a big difference, but similar core construct/tier of team despite record@RossP65730031 @Vadersback36 @LakersNation Alex Caruso dropped from 40% for 3-pointers to now 35% for 3-pointers with the Chicago Bulls. 👎 That doesn't meet the Lakers GM qualifications for an Offense 1st Mentality roster. The philosophy has changed, DEAL WITH IT !!!@THESagerbomb Chicago Bulls fan here. https://t.co/YuIrSPV4sW@ekoreen the semi collapse of the Chicago Bulls is bringing out the old argument about DeMar DeRozan. He deserves betterSince Alex Caruso returned, the Chicago Bulls have ranked 19th in defensive rating (116.9), however they have the 29th ranked offensive rating (107.5).

Throughout this 6-game stretch, the Bulls have shot 29.5% from three (29th in the league), and 44.2% from the field (26th). https://t.co/bD67Qa16ONWhat do you when you’re waiting for your 🧋 order…. An impromptu #ootd shoot with your fiancé ✨

The Bulls became what they were organically, they weren’t signing multiple franchise players to compliment Jordan. Rodman was 34 when he joined them and Kukoc  developed into an NBA player in Chicago.@shane_2104 Who are you sports allegiances?

One of the NBA teams he played for was the Chicago Bulls, and the bull was one of the clues. #TheMaskedSinger@BucksAfterDark @chicagobulls @packcrj02 @ZachLaVine @DeMar_DeRozan No, bc the rebuild has only been since our last playoff app. in 2017, maybe since we beat YOU in the playoffs in 2015, but not 24 years. And, again, your rebuild lasted for 50 yrs by your logic, so, don't compare your sorry, little franchise to Chicago. It's not even close.@chicagobulls trade TT and PW for whiteside@BucksAfterDark @chicagobulls @packcrj02 @ZachLaVine @DeMar_DeRozan 30 yrs? Nice math. 1998 was 24 years ago, that's not "almost 30". Plus, MIL hadn't won a ring in 50 yrs, no Finals apps. in 46 yrs. &amp; hadn't won a playoff series in 18 yrs. before last year. Talk about a "shit rebuild". And you talk about our drought? 🤣🤣@Bullskickass Do you think the #ChicagoBulls can stay out of the play in?

#Bulls #SeeRed #bullsnation@HisSlyness44 @chicagobulls @packcrj02 @ZachLaVine @DeMar_DeRozan We’re defending champs there is no drought, sorry a 24 year rebuild, that better?
