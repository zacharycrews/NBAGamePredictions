📻 @RipCityRadio620 https://t.co/ynpW47GY4S@SusieRants The Portland Trail Blazers had a report come out on their GM a month later, invested and actioned all by early December. Makes it look even worse when the other franchise in the same city acts and takes action in a quarter of the time.@bjforsythe @trailblazers @Dame_Lillard I think Dame still has some gas in the tank. Given that plus his stature in Blazer history, I think the team MUST do EVERYTHING it can to win now. Break the bank if you have to. Trade away the future if you are getting an all star. Just don’t use it on anything less.Consensus Line Move:
