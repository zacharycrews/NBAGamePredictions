Tank szn@KellyAuCoin77 @bruceely @trailblazers No clue why anyone gets bent out of shape about things like this. These are hyper-competitive athletes. So what if Luka wants to stay in when the Mavs are up 20. Maybe they'll start using the game as a glorified practice. Ever think that people in the arena came to see Luka?@realbryanmead @KellyAuCoin77 @bruceely @trailblazers 100%. Luka’s ankles are time bombs, you wanna risk it all to snag that rebound away from Blevins be my guest, but taking exception to being called a stat chaser when you are stat chasing is just silly.Portland Trail Blazers vs. Houston Rockets - USA: NBA

CJ McCollum Over 20.5 Points -103 (Portland Trail Blazers) 

Rockets are bottom 10 defending guards. Nice spot for CJ to bounce back after being held right on the number 20 last game.@trailblazers ooh that's a good one. didn't work though1st Round: Portland Trail Blazers 

The team that pushed LA to 7 in last years WCF were out for revenge. Led by Rasheed Wallace along with Steve Smith, Damon Stoudamire, Bonzi Wells, Scottie Pippen, and Arvydas Sabonis, they would be first to fall victim to the best playoff run https://t.co/bNaLzRcHIO@trailblazers @picklesbaseball Follow back?@picklesbaseball weluvpicklez77Jan 28 1975 - #JackNicholson took some time off from filming #OneFlewOverTheCuckoosNest to watch @trailblazers defeat @Suns 115-107.  @BillWalton had his first triple-double w/12 points, 13 rebs, and 11 assists
