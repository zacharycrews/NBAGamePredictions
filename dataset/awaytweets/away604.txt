 https://t.co/3nLCCOQYfRChicago has beaten Detroit each of their last nine matchups. Only twice in Bulls history have they beaten the Pistons 10+ times in a row: 19 straight from 1993 to 1997 and 18 straight from 2009 to 2013. Are the Bulls back? #BullsNation #Pistons https://t.co/BxXKj40fiTWe catch up with NBA Insider @ShamsCharania, who talks about the recent acquisition of Bol Bol by the @DetroitPistons as well as the potential interest in one key member of the roster from other squads. #Pistons https://t.co/hMZKi9XeLvIf my @DetroitPistons get @ChetHolmgren to go with @BolBol @CadeCunningham_ Detroit will be a problem two 7 foot shootersNoticeably a LOT of Pistons fans in the arena tonight 🤨🤨 go back to DetroitDetroit Pistons HC Dwane Casey said that he hopes Chicago Bulls forward DeMar DeRozan wins the MVP award.
 
Casey: "The game has really slowed down for him. He sees the floor, he takes what the game gives him and he's just – he's almost a magician out there."

Fit wise Mobley made the most sense for Detroit. I’m glad they took Cade because Green has more upside than Cade. I would’ve been happy with Mobley but preferred Green.@AP804 @redwings924 @BallySportsDET @CadeCunningham_ @DetroitPistons I love YouTube TV and I’ve had it for years with great success.

Only issue is when Bally Sports left and I figured they would be back in a couple months, and I’m still waiting a year plus later.

Ugh…

Not going to give up my YouTube TV just because Bally Sports is greedy.@redwings924 @DerekOkrie @BallySportsDET @CadeCunningham_ @DetroitPistons Honestly you just end up paying just as much if not more.

Im not saying he has performed the best out of the rookies this season, but shooting is certainly not his issue 😂 you would know that if you watched games instead of stats@KateeForbis Facts!!! 🗣 he brought that same energy to Detroit and almost got his ass whooped by Beef Stew.

Grant chose to come to Detroit, he’s improved greatly since becoming a Piston, and has value to a young team in restoration.

Detroit not interested in 30+ year old guys or draft picks in the high 20s.@BobbyMarks42 Jerami Grant #Pistons Trade Options –
Sacramento Kings:
Buddy Hield to Detroit would provide elite 3PM at the 2-guard – and we may even be able to add Marvin Bagley III in the deal, too. Kings are horrible on defense and Grant will help. I like this more than my fellow DET fans.@BobbyMarks42 Jerami Grant #Pistons Trade Options –
Indiana Pacers:
"I don't want to see a rebuild," owner Herb Simon
Prioritizing Domantas Sabonis over Myles Turner may be a good route, and swapping Tunrer for Jerami Grant improves Detroit’s needs. Turner is an elite25 year old rim protector.@BobbyMarks42 Jerami Grant #Pistons Trade Options –
