Rockets gave defending Champ a good fight, though I thought outcome wil b different if G’matt had more touch of the ball towards last 3 mins.
Also, need 2 bigs vs Bucks!@HoustonRockets @creditkarma Is the coach racist ? U should at some point explain why they give him such minutes. Is it because he is exhausted too fast? Dont want him to go to another club? Holding him back for what? He had only 3 pf💪 @alperennsengun
