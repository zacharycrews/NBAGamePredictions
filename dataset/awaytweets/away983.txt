2) i don't know@seanmacgo @newyorkerhumor hey sean, first time long time, I have 2 follow-up questions:

1) if the Boston Celtics were playing the Atlanta Hawks, why was the game played at New Orleans' Lakefront Arena?

2) given it's length, could a giant squid dunk from the 3pt line and would it count as a 2 or 3?The Atlanta Hawks are hanging on by a thread. Trae Young isn't concerned.
