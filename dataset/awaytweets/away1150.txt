Not to mention the turnovers lol@HCH2487 @UnrulyyWill @TorontoDame @Raptors @ScottBarnes561 He was an all star last year right? Sure that's half the amount of all stars as clev and toronto (if you include siakam from 2020), but still that as well as bey, olynk, CoJo, Diallo, Stewart are all servicable players right? Shouldn't be that low in wins if he is the roty.Kyle Lowry is a Toronto Raptor regardless of what team he plays for.

Poster dunks to be exact. #7DaysofGiveaways@Raptors Go get it üî•üî•üî•The plot thickens in the East. Detroit upsets Philly, meaning the Raptors are now 2 games back of 4th place with 6 games remaining, including a big one vs the Sixers in Toronto next Thursday (and they can claim the tiebreaker with a win).My favorite thing about this playoff race is that every other eastern teams fan's have openly said they don't want the Raptors in round 1. Meanwhile Raps fans are willing to play any team with zero ounce of fear rn. Simply making the Toronto Raptors the team to beat in the eastü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è@TerryFranconia Problem is that they are tanking, but the Raptors are rising, so we‚Äôre going to tank our way into needing to go through Toronto, then Bucks or Celtics maybe and then Nets or one of them.
