I think that if the game is close going into the 4th quarter the hawks can steal  this game.@MiamiHEAT Why is he holding a giant brick?@MiamiHEAT Game 3 PJ was a monster we need that guy againTomas Sports

He wasn't aggressive with Cappella out what will he do with him back? We have two max players in bam and kyle and a 90 mil player averaging single digits for the series. That can't happen.One note on Heat-Hawks: Miami is a +33 overall in the series…Tyler Herro is a -22, even with his big scoring night in Game 3.

They're driving to kick instead of driving to finish. Usually fair looks, but in G3, they hoisted 45 of their 93 FGs from 3. 

If they attack with intent, open 3s will come.

First up @Braves and then game 4 of @ATLHawks vs @MiamiHEAT . #SundayFundayJoin me and my co host @JohnJablonka_  for game 4 of the Miami heat preview!!! At 1:30pm! https://t.co/Kmf8DlCMAI@jonvonachen @bomani_jones KD should've signed in Miami in 2016 instead of Golden State. he took a meeting and was impressed but preferred the talent already on GS's roster. i often think about how different the league would be if he went to the heat@LaGoat8_ @MiamiHEAT @FTX_Official Im trolling idc who wins@TrolledByJimmy @MiamiHEAT @FTX_Official LmaooIt's a shame the Miami Heat couldn't have gone up 3-0 vs the Atlanta Hawks. In the breakdown I go through:
▫️Heat's late game offense
▫️Overhelping defense
▫️And many other defensive possessions in the 2nd half

https://t.co/J93W5F53BE@MiamiHEAT game later today, better kill those Hawks@NBAonTNT @MiamiHEAT @ATLHawks @Suns @PelicansNBA Heat in 5️⃣@NBAonTNT @MiamiHEAT @ATLHawks @Suns @PelicansNBA Why you should support Jaylen Brown:

#HeatTwitter #TrashTalk #OhTheHumanity #NBAPlayoffs https://t.co/IRbh868sklWatching highlights of a Sunday afternoon HEAT-Bulls game from 2011–LeBron’s first season in Miami—and it blew my mind how not even having the game’s two best players at their respective positions could prevent lower bowl fans from showing up on time. Large red patches partout.@AirGiannis @MiamiHEAT @FTX_Official Why do the bucks fans hate the heat so much? I personally love Giannis and the bucks@sexyblonde212 @MiamiHEAT @Klow7 Agree….Now, i really need the Nets to get it together, cant have the Celtics having too many days off 🤣Victor Oladipo makes it abundantly clear that he just needs to play in order to get his rhythm back https://t.co/TOODU5hpoi #MiamiHeat #HeatNation #MiamiHeatNewsSo proud of this @Dedication2Comm family, which includes the @MiamiHEAT, @MiamiPD, @CityofMiami, Florida Blue and @WilsonSportingG.

Heat need to win game 4 objectively speaking.@ImagineMichael3 @HeatCultureSZN @MiamiHEAT Miami had an excellent game one that had the Hawks shook without their starting center and a 60% Collins coming back after missing 18 games. Game 2 featured a 99th percentile Jimmy Butler. Hawks took a close game 3, Clint is possible to return a Lowery will be slowed at best.Time to go up 3-1 #HEATCulture #MiamiHeat  let everybody else make excuses while we make plays@MiamiHEAT w/another chance to put a strangle hold on series tonight in Atlanta leading Hawks2-1.

So Clint Capella playing is a very big positive for the Hawks; regardless if Lowery plays or not.During a pitching change (Shawn Armstrong for Elieser Hernandez), the Braves showed who I'm almost certain was the Miami Heat's Udonis Haslem on the scoreboard for a split second while showing fans throughout the ballpark

https://t.co/Ua4wIs2ifh@heckman_eth Miami based artist, wouldn’t be surprised if it’s related to the HEAT.@KingJames please tweet how good the Hawks look when Young is playing good (Miami Heat fan here ) 😂😂Most "fans" are like that though, like when everyone and their mother was a Miami Heat fan@Joelive24 @mroselli13 @HaterMuse Miami Heat before Lebron: 47-35

Golden State Warriors before KD: 73-9 

KD stans and Lebron's haters will forever try and make it seem like both moves were the same but it's CLEARLY NOT.As your hospitality consultant, may I recommend the accommodations of Magic City? Their wings are top tier @MiamiHEAT 😏

Ain't nobody else on the team that person! Not saying that can't but that's why he's the star of the team .For moments like them but if you don't know about jimmy look him up.@C0mplexSocieTY8 @justinrgrrb Guess we need to warn the Miami Heat players and the Dolphins as well.

@ATLHawksThe national media now officially saying Sixers have no chance vs Miami cuz they lost a game 4 on the road when already up 3-0 while Heat are up 2-1 in their series is so predictable it’s honestly comical how against Philly they are at this point. #sixersI can’t wait to smoke these cocky ass Miami Heat fans next week https://t.co/DpEaUs2WVAMiami Heat are a well-oiled basketball team

We need this in #MiamiFL #MiamiHeatWhy did the Jazz win ….. @MiamiHEAT they went quick and scored. Not take forever and shoot a fade away smh.@CoachSpo @MiamiHEAT @HeatNationCom @TheMiamiHeatUK  Part 1 OF 2
Let me remind you all how Yurt did vs the Hawks with significant min. Yurt played the Hawks on jan 12. He got 13 pts, 10 RB &amp; 6 ast. and was a +19, Collins in 33 min. 16 pts, 11 RB, 1 ast. was a -20, CONT.The Mavs pulled a Miami Heat to lose this one. Almost the same formulawhat the Utah Jazz just did should’ve been what the Miami Heat should’ve doneIt’s weird to see @DwyaneWade at @utahjazz games and not @MiamiHEAT games.man i wish luka played for the miami heat@DwyaneWade Send @spidadmitchell to da @MiamiHEAT Black Man 🤝🏾🔥@JLaboss6565 @lilrocketnasa @Rell_256 @AndrewDoxy @JBJTRW The team that had to win in their house because they were down 2-0  so they were in a must win situation won by one point with no time left in the game! Great job Hotlanta😂😂😂.Who’s your team? Put their record against the Miami Heat record in the last 10 years🤔🤫🤐@BeW1se @1GR8FULGUY @MiamiHEAT Sorry but you’re wrong. Bam is there because he brings us energy on both ends. He may not be the league’s best scoring center but he can definitely put up points. Just because Jimmy dropped 45 does not make it okay for a FADEAWAY THREE down TWO.

If you include the ast., Yurt was responsible for 25 pts. Outplayed them both.  https://t.co/uY7HVasHEi#Miami #Heat: Ready for Game 4 after looking back at Game 3⁣

Who would have stopped him other than maybe himself?🤷‍♂️I’ll take a Bam floater over another Jimmy fadeawayWindow Tinting☀️🔥🥊 Privacy! Comfort! Style! Protection!
