Daniel Theis returned after missing 2 games with a toe injury to score a team high 18 points against Denver

After the game he talked his return and the loss to the Nuggets

@HoustonRockets I @topochicohard I #TopoChicoHardSeltzer https://t.co/wKzOvmciAtThis is the worst @HoustonTexans team that I've seen since existence. 

Damm shame that on November 7th the #Texans and @HoustonRockets have a combined total or 2 wins.

It's hard out here for a Houston sports fan.@ATTSportsNetSW At least they are both consistent in one thing.  @HoustonTexans and @HoustonRockets have only won 1 game all season. Hey guys let's keep it up. 🤦‍♀️🙄 smh@ATTSportsNetSW Well for sure the @HoustonRockets won't win it.  They will probably win the best last place team in the league. What an embarrassment for this city. 2 teams that suck terribly.  @HoustonTexans and @HoustonRockets.NBA Sunday

Christian Wood of the Houston Rockets will have over 11.5 rebounds at +110 

Wood avg 12 rebounds a game, this game on a B2B so they dont think he will make it. Wood has to bang down low with Looney who just collecting a check in his final year.

But look he's only 25 yo 
He can rewrite his game if he want but it doesn't come overnight@threezustrist @GayeYoussoupha @KidKinsey @HoustonRockets lets not forget what he has proven he can do without embiid on the court, 42 in Utah, 16 or 17 game win streak without him as a rookie (or sophomore i guess since people wanna slander him for that too) they clearly dont fit that well idk how it took so long to realize@GayeYoussoupha @DontForgetWall @KidKinsey @HoustonRockets This is the dude that sucks apparently https://t.co/eYFdMt1EwWThe Houston Rockets Ryan Anderson had 69 points 24 rebounds.the houston rockets are currently turning the ball over more than any other team this century (19.7 per game)@DontForgetWall @GayeYoussoupha @KidKinsey @HoustonRockets And people act like he shoots 15% from the FT like he shot 61% last season@threezustrist @DontForgetWall @KidKinsey @HoustonRockets Exactly

He’s a 3-time all star for a reason and he’s all-defense. Those typically aren’t laying around for cheap.Asked Dwane Casey about Cade Cunningham going against the 2021 draft 2nd, 3rd and 4th picks this week. "I'm sure it's (fun) for the fans that keep up with it, but for us it's the Detroit Pistons against the Houston Rockets. We can't afford to get caught up in anything like that."Dwane Casey said that maybe the fans may get caught up in the matchups between lottery picks, but for them, it's going to be the Detroit Pistons vs. Houston Rockets etc.#Pistons Dwane Casey on Cade Cunningham facing the No. 2, 3 and 4 picks this week: "For us, we're going against the Houston Rockets (and Cavs and Raptors)."Kel got 8 fav teams smh hatin on my lakeshow like he ain’t just rock with the Houston rockets two years ago 🤣@threezustrist @GayeYoussoupha @KidKinsey @HoustonRockets yeah i figured danny green would match salary off the top of my head or some other older asset to try and match salaries, a 3 team deal is what we would want for sure, and im still all for bringing simmons to DC too even with our great start@HoustonRockets @RocketsTracker It’s showing improvement. They are a young team getting use to playing together and showing such growth. It will improve with the season. Almost beat LA and Denver. Keep it up guys. Fans here to support you. #Respect@HypeBeast692 @HoustonRockets I’m remember walking up those stairs to many rockets 🚀 games@DontForgetWall @GayeYoussoupha @KidKinsey @HoustonRockets Salary wise, the 1-for-1 deal wouldn’t work out. Philly would have to add more player(s) to get it done so I doubt they do it.

The Rockets will still have 2 other 1st round picks. I’m not worried because the Rockets also does a good job of signing good undrafted guys (e.g., Jae’Sean Tate, Armoni Brooks) and trading for more draft picks in random deals.@HoustonRockets When your backcourt of porter and green scoring a combined 15pts you going to lose most of the time.....the rockets have had a rough schedule this early in the season......just going to be a crooked huge losing/learning yearThrowback to when the @warriors edged out the @HoustonRockets in Game 7 of the 2018 Western Conference Finals.

Glad he’s on our side! https://t.co/e4G0XWsIJlEven tho I had Mobley &gt; Green, Green will be good enough for the Rockets GM to keep his job. Houston should be out of their rebuild by 2023FT.
