https://t.co/923F1AGHP6Tonight’s Cavs game will be my 575th straight @Cavs game watched - including preseason, regular season and playoffs

The last game I missed was at Nets on 27th March 2015 - my tablet wouldn't connect to WiFi at the United Center whilst watching CBJ play so couldn't watch that one@BryanTali12 @imlyricalbro @DeanScorpion_ Of course I know that LeBron and the Cleveland Cavaliers came back from a 1-3 defect.

It represents the one series victory they have If your only going to win 1 of the 4 it might as well be when your one L away from what would have eventually been a 0-4 record.@SerenaWinters @cavs Wish I’d known this before I put my life savings on this game 😔@SerenaWinters @cavs Of courseSources close to the @cavs tell me that the #Cavs are playing the Bulls down there. About the only good thing about the Spanish broadcast spot at United Center is that I can say nobody has ever been closer to MJ Championship  banners. https://t.co/NFnatFAS5jWe're closing in on @chicagobulls vs. @cavs tipoff at United Center!

#LEGENDoftheMiamiHEAT #NBA75@cavs Hello?@cavs Can we play Goodwin never understood why when rondo comes back he’s out the rotation when we are down players@cavs Brown over Davis please@workingmomblog @cavs @CleGuardians That’s if I can afford it. And @MLB and I are on the outs.@cavs Jimmy Butler is a foul merchant@cavs Cedi Osman is not smart. When you get the ball back with the shot clock off you take your time and play the clock out unless you’re clearly wide open transitionLet's do better next quarter @Cavs...
#LetEmKnow@DGFanClub__ @cavs He took 2 shots and made one@cavs Maybe they can find their shot this quarter. Too many bricks! 😱@cavs Lol when our defense is back our offense disappears y’all hilarious@cavs Just wondering where’s Goodwin and new guy Moses@cavs play brown@cavs South Beach Flu is in full effect.@cavs bruh if i have to see cedi get stripped driving to the basket one more time i might lose it@cavs This offense https://t.co/zYKY0Z5pZ9@cavs We need to get HEALTHY!!!@cavs At least they enjoyed their 3 day vacation#MIAvsCLE
