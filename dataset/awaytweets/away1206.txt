This is about the practice facility. The state and locals already funded part of the stadium years ago. But ok let’s give the Panthers no more $ then Charlotte won’t have a team. I think this was tried with the Hornets and ultimately regretted.@HornetsPR @hornets @NBA Steph’s record is gonna be up for grabs at some point: he’s missed so many games, and he wasn’t launching them early in his career like these players are now.@antjams That's an apples and oranges comparison.  There are more black people in LA than there are in Charlotte, plus LaMelos family is from the black parts of LA. 

In terms of the Hornets, it's clear that they aren't focused on appealing to black folks. Look at the media coverageApril 8, 1996: The Hornets end the Bulls' 44-game home winning streak with a 98-97 win in the United Center, dropping Chicago's season record to 66-9.

Kenny Anderson had 20 PTS and Dell Curry added 19 for Charlotte. Michael Jordan had 40 PTS/11 REB/5 AST for Chicago.

The trade package would include Terry Rozier or Gordon Hayward along with Kelly Oubre Jr.

The hornets game is Charlotte is one of the few games where he actually had an impactJust 2 games to play before the playoffs but Miami will be # 1 in the East. The Heat open the post-season at home April 17. Who’s the first opponent we don’t know yet , depends with 4 teams , Brooklyn Nets, Cleveland Cavaliers , Atlanta Hawks or Charlotte Hornets.

Russ works best as the primary hall handler which he wouldn’t be in Charlotte and his rim pressure is declining as his athleticism wadesI think that the Charlotte Hornets path to the playoffs will involve beating the Cleveland Cavaliers and the Atlanta Hawks. 

If they’re going to play Cleveland, might as well go all out for the three way tiebreaker so they can be the 8th seed.Chicago Bulls - Charlotte Hornets İddaa Tahmini 09.04.22

Why on earth would the @hornets need or want Russ when they have Ball &amp; Rozier? 😂, If @JeanieBuss offered me a GM/Executive position with a $450k or more salary,I would make a trade for @TheTraeYoung to team up w/@KingJames https://t.co/umRVQNLFYo@trailblazers @Pacers @hornets did u guys watch THT tonight lol@NBA @hornets Hello 👋🏾@KyleBaileyClub @hornets This would be terrible. He would set us back tremendously. Only reason would be for his expiring contract and the ability to dump Heyward’s salary@KyleBaileyClub @hornets You trade Hayward and a salary filler for Westbrook, immediately buy him out, and get Hayward’s deal off a year early in order to sign PJ in 2023 and keep flexibility. It makes some sense, and you probably get a pick from the Lakers to do it.the stuff #LameloBall has shown this year, he's bursting with flavor

#AllFly | @hornets https://t.co/HUHHRUyh9G70-50 Charlotte at halftime. Hornets really need to close quarters better, still a lot of time left.
