#MagicTogether@YodaRaptor @MagicMan816 @Magic_PR @OrlandoMagic @thats_G_ @jalensuggs He was coming off the bench for this game because he’s coming off a stomach bug. He’s going to start regularly@YodaRaptor @MagicMan816 @Magic_PR @OrlandoMagic @thats_G_ @jalensuggs Orlando isn’t known for drafting a player and putting him to start immediately. They ease them off the bench. That’s why Magic players always become great. We just can’t lock them up long enough to be actual winners.@OrlandoMagic @jalensuggs Harris underrated

In 32 seasons, Orlando has only won in San Antonio 6 times.

One of those was on November 29th, 2016, when Orlando were led to a 95-83 win by Serge Ibaka
