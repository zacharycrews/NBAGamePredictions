For the ones to like to ladder AYO assists stats. They play the Phoenix Suns today. I think they are going to limit his playmaking ability.#HappyBirthday to one of the greatest point guards of all-time, Steve Nash, who turns 48 today.

https://t.co/8DwFUDjp9KDamn. I thought there were too many Phoenix Suns podcasts 5 years ago…@matthew_foutz @mikalbridgiz @RSaenzFox10 @FOX10Phoenix @Suns Could they get involved in a Ben Simmons deal and come out with Thybulle? Because Mikal and Thybulle are 1 and 1a when it comes to perimeter defense imoTomorrow is the dayyyyy I can’t wait I literally can’t sleep @Suns I’ve been waiting for February 7th to get this jersey signed of @DevinBook a replica Moss Point HS jersey ever since I bought the tickets in November! I hope it can be a very special night@Thedojo1 @Jumpshot8 @Suns @BuffaloBills So what you're saying is... The Suns have lost to playoff contending teams while GSW has lost to what? BUMS? Yes that's exactly what you're saying lmao!I can’t say it enough!

Saric/Stix/Shamet + pick sounds pretty good for a guy who plays D and shoots the 3 that well.@matthew_foutz @muttero4 @FOX10Phoenix @Suns I guess it depends on what you have to give upSee you on Tuesday my @Suns !!@muttero4 @RSaenzFox10 @FOX10Phoenix @Suns Why wouldn’t you shore up guard depth???@KJan55en @RSaenzFox10 @FOX10Phoenix @Suns When has CP3 made it thru a playoffs without injury and who’s his backup? Regular season wins don’t address playoff weaknesses. We don’t have enough guard depth. Shamet’s a bust. This is the window so SHORE UP GUARD DEPTH!@mikalbridgiz @RSaenzFox10 @FOX10Phoenix @Suns Someone like Mikal? Seriously, what better perimeter defender are they going to get than Bridges? Realistically…The next 3 games for the suns are gonna be goin through hell and back….. COME ON BOYZ!!! @Suns 🔥🔥🔥$100,000 Wagers I made in 2021 #GamblingTwitter
