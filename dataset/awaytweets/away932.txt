Thanks so much to the bigwigs for thinking of the fans that have so much nostalgic attachment to this place!!I shared this memory on Facebook yesterday. Today, I see the news about the March 19 farewell event. I'm sure every NBA fan in the Sacramento area, not just Kings fans, has a story about Arco Arena.

If you can go to the celebration, do it! Details here: https://t.co/SeQdZ4l3RT https://t.co/6CPO5IENuPExcited that I get to go my first NBA game in years.

Would love to take my daughter to her first game ever! 🙃Former @SacramentoKings draftee Nik Stauskas aka Sauce Castillo just dropped 57 points, 6 rebounds, 5 assists and 11 threes in an @nbagleague game.
