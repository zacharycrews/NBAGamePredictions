With four games against the Nets and losing all three games against them last season, hopefully they'll make up for it with a W tonight.

@nyknicks https://t.co/PBa9WKxZtMWhat are the @nyknicks doing? (panicking) #Kemba has always been a liability on defense, even as an All-Star. That’s not why you acquire him. He’s there to get buckets, not lead the team in assists or be a stopper. But you have to give him that freedom. https://t.co/8iqiH8PmK1@WitnessMurda @nyknicks Thibs would love him@DScottRandell @NYRangers @nyknicks @nyjets @Mets Right with you brotha. Usc got Riley tooThis last 96 hours in Dan Randell sports teams literally never happens. @NYRangers W, @nyknicks W, @nyjets W, @Mets sign the pitching duo in the game, Jets draft pick via Seattle just became top 5.
