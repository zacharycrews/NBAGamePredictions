@superstarcurry@cassmoni_ @KlayThompson @warriors Thank you so much! ☺️New York Knicks are trying so hard to be the Golden State Warriors, but they’re personnel is that of the Pelicans. 41 3PA tonight, when the Thunder don’t even have a rim protector? That’s AWFUL coaching by Thibs, and execution by the players. #NewYorkForever@warriors Scary hours, not for us though@DavidAl20355787 @warriors @StephenCurry30 Can you shoot the with 2 and 3 people guarding you? Really? Think about it.Check out this listing I just added to my #Poshmark closet: Draymond green golden state warriors championship jersey 2017 rare adidas XXL. https://t.co/ggEhfZqfnP #shopmycloset @poshmarkappCongratulations to bshahvar (@BenjaminShahvar) who moved up 96 spots to take #51 on the Golden State Warriors team leaderboard.

https://t.co/W6VN3LlptPThe way Portland gives you room at the perimeter makes me really respect the kind of defense other teams have played this year.

They got the Lakers looking like the Golden State Warriors.Congratulations to don_juan_pablo_cristal who moved up 20 spots to take #23 on the Golden State Warriors team leaderboard.

https://t.co/W6VN3LlptP@warriors Not long now Xmas 2022 is coming early for @warriors fans around the world@KhashHater lakers are going to beat the golden state warriors so the suns dont have to@Ceci22 @KlayThompson @warriors Damn that’s amazing!@CocchiaraSam @BleacherReport You must be drunky 🥂 Solute my friend, they won’t even make the playoffs!! 😩 @warriors @LakersNation@yimstudio @StephenCurry30 @warriors Are the prints of these going to be $35? And is it possible to preorder one?@DavidAl20355787 @warriors @StephenCurry30 I played for 15 years competitively, and still play now.  What you said was stupid. In general yes, players need to work on counters. But to think that Steph isn’t working on countermoves is one of the dumbest things I’ve ever heard.@anthonyVslater @warriors If u look close JP wearin Steph’s jersey https://t.co/WjQupkJ1Xi@anthonyVslater @warriors It’s a beautiful thing@__Clemmy @warriors Nothing new@anthonyVslater @warriors Allhe needs is some of those 70s short shorts and he’s ready to go.@Lucinda37233179 @brevinknight22 @memgrizz @Suns @warriors We haven't done that in awhile.@warriors I love Klay.  But the fact is, he didn't play in two years, voting him as all star is unfair to all those who are playing today.Which is why you need to pair him with an elite defender like Draymond in golden state @warriors https://t.co/vrkAbLmc3m@SteveGrother @StephenCurry30 @warriors Happy New Year!!@0fficialNBAFAN @ShamsCharania @warriors @braden8_24 @SportsCenter @ZachLaVine @wojespn @TheHoopCentral @BleacherReport @Lakers @ChiraqPlsWin @mevvybear @Stacey21King @ChiSportUpdates @Pacers @hayescarroll_ @HanaHoops @Money23Green @ATLHawks @NickAdamsinUSA Same circle as Lavine I made it@yimstudio @StephenCurry30 @warriors You’re welcome! Have a great New Year! Keep up the awesome work!@SteveGrother @StephenCurry30 @warriors Thank you 🙏 Steve!!@yimstudio @StephenCurry30 @warriors Looking great! Excited to see it when it’s done. Love that you post the progress on your work.Rumores NBA: ¿Anthony Davis a Golden State Warriors? https://t.co/D7Ll8S4YmVScratch that….@warriors haven’t been healthy for 3 seasons. https://t.co/BpNyKDUmqu@Money23Green So the Warriors would rather forfeit games then reschedule because of roster issues.  Remember that NBA Commissioner.  Golden State isn't living up to their nickname unless they changed it to cry baby sissiesProgress on the backround…

He should be hype too.@Joseph__Cote @KendrickPerkins @warriors I get it. Sorry@anthonyVslater @warriors Love to see them both on the court 😄🤩 https://t.co/ui3NePw0t4@warriors when will kaly back@thrillofsports @MadScientistFF @warriors nobody had us in the championship! Not one!  And we don’t even have our other half back! Bout to be 🔥#KlayThompson@jcfphotog .@warriors are winning the championship in 2022. Happy new year man, thanks always for your good pictures 🙏🏻🔥@Jumpshot8 @ATLHawks @nuggets @spurs @HoustonRockets @dallasmavs @LAClippers @warriors Correct yourself and meet a good counselor. You'll need it sooner than later.@warriors Competition ramped up. We all know Splash Bros pushing each other gonna make the team even more of a threat.@silverklarkkent @warriors @StephenCurry30 It’s simple I think like a hooper dummy. It’s different if u don’t play fucc nigga. Kinda like the analysts talk and they never played b-ball before@Jumpshot8 @warriors @jazz I love how the warriors live rent free in your head. It’s a beautiful thing to see their success tick you off 😆😆😆😆@warriors @22wiggins Happy for him may MAN WIGGINS getting recognize by the media and people. ❤️🔥@KNBR @warriors I’m so excited 😆@warriors I miss y’all DEARLY! Hurry back Klay 🏀🏀🏆🏆@anthonyVslater @warriors This video gives me lifee&lt;3@Jumpshot8 @TaigaBarca10 @johnnyoplaya64 Why so much hate for the @warriors Eddie? I just can't get it. As a fan I accept we played bad against nuggets even though we lost by 1 possession. Why can't you accept that Suns played some bad games recently? They lost couple with some margin. Dive inside rather looking out.@warriors Steph gonna be locked in 💯 when Klay returns.@Lucinda37233179 @memgrizz @Suns @warriors Human nature to get up for the major teams.@BleacherReport @warriors Can’t wait!@anthonyVslater @warriors Steph klay wiggs dray kuminga when everyone healthy👀@anthonyVslater @warriors Can’t wait to see Klay Thompson back! I don’t care if he’s able to return to the HOF player that he was I just more would like to see the man end his career on his terms and not due to health@brevinknight22 @memgrizz Why do you think the @memgrizz play better on the road or against teams like @suns @warriors, but we seem to lose games against teams we are expected to win?I’m a simple man, all I ask for 2022 to not be a complete shithole like 2021 are the following:
1. Meet @taylorswift13 
2. @warriors win the chip and @StephenCurry30 gets MVP + FMVP
3. @FCBarcelona win Europa, top 4 la Liga, and Erling Haaland culer
4. I pass Masters@TheAthleticNBA @warriors Splash brother reunion will be insane on an already great teamI told y’all the bulls was my team this year. I’m always a golden state warrior but I told y’all to watch them @chicagobulls 💪🏾🔥☄️@anthonyVslater @warriors Thank you for this, im getting teary eyed already.@BleacherReport @warriors "Lebron James"
