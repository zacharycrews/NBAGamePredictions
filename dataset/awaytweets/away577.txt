John Collins is exactly the front court player Ben Simmons needs

Trae Young and every single member of the Atlanta Hawks core is a perfect fit for Ben Simmons

TRAVIS SCHLENK is perfect for Ben Simmons https://t.co/LmdAXYMZGgI've been preaching all season that the Atlanta Hawks might have one of the deepest teams in the NBA. It isn't translating to wins like they wanted to, but that depth chart might be able to pull off a trade for Simmons (i.e., Cam Reddish, Kevin Huerter, draft picks, etc.) https://t.co/TUpZdnN4CBOur very own @LockStarPicks_ gives us another great pick!!...
