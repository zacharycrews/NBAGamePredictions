As Gregg Popovich now oversees his own sub-.500 team with the Spurs, Warriors head coach Steve Kerr still sees San Antonio playing with the same togetherness and intentionality that was foundational to its two-decade run among the league’s heavyweights.

#nba #gospursgo #NBATwitter #porvida@WKUFan518 Not minimizing your point but San Antonio is almost 1.5m people. There’s not another big school there or an NFL team. Spurs aside, theres way more people there and nothing else to draw their attention. Different circumstances than BGKY.@ThePackageJG I watch every game for both teams. Golden State is a terrible match up for San Antonio. SAis very predictable offensively and Golden State is too smart. Spurs better hope they hit jump shots tonight or this game will be a blowout.

Murray will feast on GS TOs though.Check out this listing I just added to my #Poshmark closet: San Antonio Spurs. https://t.co/h7E0ExetvP #shopmycloset @poshmarkappIt is very hard to beat Gambit as of now with their performance. It's like a San Antonio Spurs team. GGs, they will advance to the quarterfinals.  #VALORANTChampions@GervinTwittiot @Caleb62905581 @shamon_x @DavidVe64270691 @TheHoopCentral If you don’t remember, there were only 4 teams that were pursuing Demar. Those 4 teams were the Bulls, Clippers, Lakers, and Spurs. He did not want to return to San Antonio and both LA teams wanted him to come on a vet minimum. So it was either they help Chicago or get nothing.This weeks Shot Clocktail is @spurs themed

I’ve never seen the Spurs miss on a European on their roster so that gives me cause to pause.. and also it depends on how much stock we put into the GLeague.. like didn’t Iggy light up the GLeague? Galloway too?@spurs_four The only soda better than Dr Pepper is Big Red but that's only a san Antonio thing, Mr Pibb better by a bit as well (Xtra one tho)@Copa90 It's most probably the link with the name San Antonio Spurs😏San Antonio Spurs ≠ Tottenham Hotspurs https://t.co/5v5tsCT0QESan Antonio Spurs Towel 30x60 Beach Style https://t.co/gUd4iKM0w0
