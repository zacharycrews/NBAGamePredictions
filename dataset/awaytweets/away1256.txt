#jamesharden #houstonrockets #basketballseason #nbaseason #basketballplayergreatness https://t.co/9iz2WNOPDSSomeone tell me why this Miami heat game is not on right now. I thought I missed the first quarter and this bitch ain’t even started yetWhat you didn’t know was that during the delay, Dominique Wilkins poured extra strength laxative in the Miami Heat Gatorade kegs… 😫💨💩🚽#delaygateAs a Bulls fan, I just can’t hate the Miami Heat. I can’t. 

I was a big Wade-Shaq fan in 2006 when the Heat won. 

Then between 2010-2014 when Wade and Bosh won alongside LeBron. 

So basically “grew up” watching the Miami Heat. #HeatCulture #NBAPlayoffsIt’s crazy the amount of disrespect the @MiamiHEAT get!! https://t.co/IMWvj9yB9yThe Heat should be insulted that the line is only Miami -1.5@leviteighting @OfficialATL3 @PIayoffJimmy @MiamiHEAT He should be on a watchlist just for being a fan of Atlanta sports1:30am Johannesburg South Africa - Let’s do this @MiamiHEAT #heatcultureall 3 analysts picked against us for narrative reasons @MiamiHEAT #HEATCulture you seeing this shit?NBA live

The Hawks can't live with this Miami team, &amp; the Heat will want to wrap this series up with minimal fuss. So far they've been beaten by a combined 34 PTS &amp; even if it's closer tonight, I still like Miami to go 3-0 up.

Actually they did in a way and it was the big three in Miami and we all know happened with the Celtics trying to stop LBJ, Dwade, and Chris Bosh. Then the Heat had shooters too.Playing “oh we winning” all damn day! #HEATCulture @MiamiHEAT@TheNBACentral @LeBatardShow Chris Herro this is why analytics are cool

If Tyler Herro doesn't exist on the Miami Heat they win 3.8 less games in '21-22

If Tyler Herro was a net+ to winning and not a net- his WS/48 would be above .1 
and the entire team would be below him not above

Hawks defense is consistently bad so I see Miami getting 112+ in this one.

Atlanta is a different beast at home so I think their offense shows up with their backs against the wall which is why I think this total is too low.

Laid down their weapons to raise families, tend to their crops, died in battle or went to rehab. Some of us are still around, but would probably take a Boston/Miami conference final to awake.@5ReasonsSports L take Im a heat fan but dragic was 3rd team all nba before Miami and brown is just brown I don’t think we had anything to do with his growth. The heat development thing is a real thing with other players but this isn’t one@juicefrom300 I like the modern uniforms. I wish they would use the Miami nights unis more. Or do a jersey like the Vice Heat jerseys but with the green and orange.
