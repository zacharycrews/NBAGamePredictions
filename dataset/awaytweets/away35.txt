A team with two players that can make a shot is not fun to watch.@FrogmansWorld @celtics @greenbean3742 Because this entire organization insists that you win with effort. Good teams that stay healthy don’t have to play max effort every night in order to win. That’s why this team is always injured.@isaiahthomas When are you joining the Boston Celtics?@Noah_Sayed529 @celtics Noah at the rate you give away your bones we aint gonna havd much of you left by next season 🤣@peteroverzet @jeskeets @JacksAbby @celtics we looked haaaarrrrible!Boston Celtics Fanatics Kelly T-Shirt Green
