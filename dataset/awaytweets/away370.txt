The 2023 draft is loaded and he wants to tank to get a pick 1-3.

SGA + Dort come to his office and say "we want to compete next season" (2022-23). If we aren't, I want to be traded.

What do you do?Charlotte Hornets - Philadelphia 76ers
Toronto Raptors - Oklahoma City Thunder
Miami Heat - Milwaukee Bucks

#Betting #FreePicks https://t.co/0qDvuBeLLNJust stumbled across a deal which would send Domas Sabonis to the Oklahoma City Thunder.

It's a pretty steep price to pay so I'm going to write my thoughts about it below.
