 #ChicagoBulls #NBAPOTD NBA 6pm CST Chicago Bulls v Washington Wizards under 223(-110)

the bulls on the road on the back end of a b2b is a recipe for disaster. They’ve averaged 106 in their last 10 away games. I think the bulls defense will show up, they need this win badly. Taking the under.@chicagobulls Sure ain’t playing nor coaching like they do. #oneanddone@chicagobulls Dropped 11 in the last 15 games huh😐😲😳🙄🤔🤦🏽‍♂️The Chicago Bulls say that Zach LaVine is questionable to play in tonight’s game due to left knee soreness.Boston Celtics

Don’t let my Chicago Bulls fall into the play in tournament and may this deviled curse of forgetting how to play basketball be lifted. 

Amen 🙏 

(this little light of mine starts playing )

#BullsNation https://t.co/CmdvBCdsjU https://t.co/qXehgRPG2oPoint is, Patrick Williams' return to the Chicago Bulls roster isn't going to pull the team out of their funk, nor will he be the difference between winning and losing a first-round playoff series. He is what we've seen, and we need to accept that. 

Now get healthy, Lonzo! (5/5)@chicagobulls @SamSmithHoops They need to stop settling for hero ball jumpersChicago next month for a Bulls playoff game@RelativityHQ I've been trying to invite your Marketing team to a @chicagobulls game!

https://t.co/ajpJ8xkZBG https://t.co/MpFMc5eVRaImportant games for Celtics fans tonight in the standings race:

Philadelphia vs Milwaukee  7:00 (Boston is guaranteed to move up to the 3 seed in front of the team that loses this game.)

Chicago vs Washington(Chicago loss can give Boston a full 4 game lead over the Bulls.)Coby White was great right after the deadline. But he has been bad since ASB, a disappointing development when the Bulls have badly needed him. As he nears extension eligiblity in offseason, his time might be running out in Chicago. Latest @ForbesSports: https://t.co/dRdvVL7Y36#Cavs Raptors and Bulls all have similarly tough remaining schedules.

I think we might be more likely to pip Chicago to that 6th seed than Toronto as the Bulls probably have the toughest remaining games out of all 3

#GamblingTwitter #FreePlays #BullsNation@chicagobulls we need to trade Vuc for Daniel Theis. The Bulls dnt need a scoring center with two 20+point scorers already. We just need a competent one who will defend and body rebound and can occasionally hit a 3@chicagobulls I think if we could learn to rebound on the offense side we would do a lot better.

New York Knicks 109-104 Chicago Bulls.@DEUCEMCBRlDE @BrokenNickMan16 @chicagobulls As a Knicks fan, keeping Robinson is going to be very difficult for the Knicks to do. Plenty of teams are going to want to overpay him despite his averages being well below most other starting centers in the league. He's only a top 10 center in blocks. That is it.Congratulations to da_faceman (@KayumRashidov) who moved up 3 spots to take #14 on the Chicago Bulls team leaderboard.

I was going to disagree with you about him being our best shooter, but hes 42% from 3 , even with a small sample size thats impressive. Just being able to move the ball instead of deebo drawing a double and passing it out leading to a TO is sm better@Shelbydekunle @anams_elvis Oh dw I watch the best players in league a lot , that’s what I meant by watch ball Wetin be Chicago bulls lmao , if you did the same , you’d know Tatum is a better overall player@chicagobulls @nyknicks I didn't expect that@Ken_k____ Also haven’t heard much about Chicago since the “Defensive god” Pat will came back?

And I'm not talking chicago.@chicagobulls As much as Demar is good, he is the only one that can shine cause the ball stops moving when he has it.  Many of his assist come from bailout kick outs.@chicagobulls He didn't think his team was bad offensively tonight?! What game was he watching?

We always start the game well, then go to isolation offense and half speed defense, and then we wonder why we lose. Gonna get bounced in the 1st round playing like this@nategodlewski87 @chicagobulls I'm okay with Holmes as well.
