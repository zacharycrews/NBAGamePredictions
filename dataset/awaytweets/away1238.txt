1u Joel Embiid u 33.5 P -120

He has gone under this in the last 9 of 10 games against Raptors and 7 out of 7 in the playoffs against the Raptors. This guy is not mvp. Toronto know how to defend Embiid

A huge contrast in styles here, as the Sixers' star power &amp; interior presence goes against the speed-you-up defense of the Raps. OG Anunoby &amp; Fred VanVleet are difference-makers if healthy -- on both ends

Prediction: Raptors in 7 https://t.co/iq4m4KFpOIIf you're not already, follow KOC and listen to his podcasts. Definitely one of the best NBA analysts, and the dude has always respected the @Raptors.

It’s rare when you can enjoy a postseason with little to no expectations. I’m not saying that I don’t expect them to win, but it’s a fun time when you can watch a young team grow. That said, @Raptors in 6 in The 6. #NBAPlayoffs #RaptorsvsSixersWho yall got this series between Toronto and Philadelphia!

It's going to be intense. Each and every game.

Raptors v 76ers SGP is ready! Even with the doubles and the wall Toronto builds, Embiid gets 28 &amp; 10. Many of those baskets will be assisted by Harden and Maxey’s energy will be needed. Siakam and Barnes are matchup problems for Philadelphia.🤘 https://t.co/0hdM16vACB@BlueJays @Raptors @ScottBarnes561 @pskills43 @gtrentjr @DALANOBANTON @OAnunoby @wacchi1013 @yungsmoove21 @MLSEPR Wouldn’t we be better off only using Ryu when necessary instead of as part of the regular rotation?

#WeTheNorth  #PricelessThe most underrated 1st round series is the Philadelphia 76ers and the Toronto Raptors. I expect this series to 7 games, but Philly will get redemption in their house in a tight game 7. #NBAPlayoffs https://t.co/BzUvbhBTu5@J0eyD215 @Raptors We Own PhillyIn some ways, Scottie Barnes and the Raptors can’t lose against the Sixers.

Win or lose in their first-round playoff series, for Toronto it’s a chance for some high-stakes tutelage, the kind of learning that only comes with doing.

#Opinion by @dfeschuk https://t.co/Vaz9DZTDZk@Raptors #WeTheNorth stay up 👍🏾👍🏾@mottocto @oldhockeycards This is so fresh. 
I so wish that the Seattle franchise took on this name and look. It’s so marketable compared to the Kraken. Think of the alliteration: Seattle Seals.

#WeTheNorth #NBAPlayoffs https://t.co/mEnMJCzzimToronto is notoriously unlucky when kicking off playoff series, with a record of 5-16 (23.8% W) in Game 1s throughout team history.

Raptors are also 21-37 (36.2% W) in road games during the postseason and 7-7 (50.0% W) against PHI in series.

How will tonight go? #WeTheNorth https://t.co/0Lh4I8W6X2@DogSurfRoadshow @Suns @PelicansNBA @memgrizz @Timberwolves @warriors @nuggets @utahjazz @dallasmavs @MiamiHEAT @ATLHawks @celtics @BrooklynNets @Bucks @chicagobulls @Raptors @sixers A lot of people are bummed that the clipps won’t play the suns… but I’m pretty excited to see Valanciunis is absolutely destroy ayton… he will at least put a hole in his chest a few times.

I actually couldn't care because I snagged tickets on Smarter than Derringer a few weeks ago to see Rod Stewart &amp; Cheap Trick a few wks. ago !

WOOHOOOOO!!! 🥊🏀💪 https://t.co/Z0RxKq72GQRaptors beat Sixers: 4-3

Harden is the biggest X-Factor of this series. Toronto won the season series 3-1 and the only loss was without VanVleet. The Raptors have proven to be one of the most dangerous teams in the East. The absence of Thybulle will also be a problem for Philly. https://t.co/lwQ2kRBQVaLet’s go @Raptors 🇨🇦🇨🇦🇨🇦#WeTheNorth https://t.co/f1N228a3yX@RyanCerrritos @diandraann @Nibble_2x2 @TheNBACentral @Raptors @DeMar_DeRozan @trailblazers @russwest44 @Dame_Lillard @Lakers 🤣🤣 I was just naming him bcuz of his style of play that’s all.@McDonaldsCanada @Raptors Why aren't the Raptors called the Torontosaurus Rex?Good luck @Raptors ! https://t.co/91bwmZMhlvThe chase for the Larry O'Brien Trophy starts now!

Is it because they play in Toronto that you didn’t watch them? Leonard was the third best Raptor in that playoff run. He put them over the top, but 6x all stars are rarely role players.There’s a lot of really great information in this video with the help of some Toronto media greats @BlakeMurphyODC, @william_lou, and @samfolkk!

I would too. Raps in 6!Predictions:
Raptors Lose tonight
Then win Game 2, 3 and 4
Lose game 5 in Philly
And Win game 6 in Toronto.

Then i don't know what happens in Miami.

...but, the more I think about it with my head we might make it far

I’m not begging for dame nor do I even care if the trade is happened or not. I think when I’m explaining it comes off like “we need Dame” in actuality Portland hasn’t been a wining organization in a long time. Not wining seasons. This isn’t a#NBAPlayoffs

Just can’t wait.Philadelphia 76ers vs Toronto Raptors is on ESPN App (US). With commentary from Dave Pasch. Reporter is Cassidy Hubbarth.  For more details see https://t.co/6Esad0VWIL #Philadelphiaers #TorontoRaptors #ESPNAppUSI know the @Raptors had a great 2nd half to the season, but I really don't see them advancing to the 2nd round, they have to beat an experienced 76ers team with Embiid and Harden. They can't stop both. I feel comfortable picking the 76ers. #NBA #NBATwitter #NBAPlayoffs@ESPNNBA @stephenasmith You say “ against the Toronto Raptors “ like they’re not worthy. Be nice ok and remember we are the 2019 NBA CHAMPIONS 🖤💜♥️The Toronto Raptors start their 2022 NBA playoff journey today against the Philadelphia 76'ers. @MikeGArsenault has more on if the team can upset Philly and set themselves up for a long playoff run.

The FO has made It pretty clear the direction they’re going and It isn’t this. And Russ isn’t going to be a small contract.Eastern conference round 1 predictions: 

Miami Heat to win 4-2 vs Atlanta Hawks. 

Boston Celtics to win 4-3 vs Brooklyn Nets (yes, unfortunately the Celtics will win this series)

Milwaukee Bucks 4-1 vs Chicago Bulls 

Philadelphia 76ers 4-3 Toronto Raptors. #NBAPlayoffs@Raptors THIS IS EPIC!!!!

Bravo ❤🇨🇦 🏀I don't know how valuable you think Shot Making is in the playoffs- I think it does get overvalued by some. But the gap between Philly and Toronto is huge here. Of course the Raptors have a huge edge in scheme and roster versatility. So a fascinating matchup. https://t.co/gLivdQeh6X@80noodle80 @ESPNNBA @Raptors That's a US thing.

Also clearly you do care since you’re replying to this tweet shitting on the Raptors and bragging about how little you care.@HPbasketball @Raptors win Game 1Feels like a good day to bet on the Toronto RaptorsFacing their Atlantic Division rivals in the opening round, the Raptors – with a few key players battling injuries – have their work cut out for them. The teams return to Toronto for game 3 on April 20 – minus one unvaccinated 76er. https://t.co/hi8GiCYfO7 https://t.co/gAze8CNdM8It’s been a minute since the championship parade in Toronto, so let’s rewind the tape, shall we?⏪ Due to the pandemic, the Raptors played the remainder of 2020 games in Florida, and missed the playoffs last year – ending a seven-season postseason streak. https://t.co/hi8GiCYfO7 https://t.co/hjnJ7IrxulGrab a #WeTheNorth sign and put on your jersey because @Raptors are back in the NBA playoffs – three years after winning the championship.

Makes it easy to root for them in the playoffs in that sense.@ninamorena Thybulle not being able to play in Toronto could be the difference in a couple of games. Plus Raptors have the length to match up with Philly.

Game 2, Embiid scores 40+ and win. They lose Games 3 and 4 in Toronto. Come back to Philly and win game 5. Then lose Game 6 in Toronto.(4)76ers vs. Raptors(5)
Some people think this might be an upset but James and Joel have both played their best basketball in the 1st round, throughout their careers. Toronto is good defensively and are well coached but they have no answer for Joel in the post.
Philadelphia in 5Today is the beginning of the Toronto Raptors burying this era of the Philidelphia 76ers once and for all.@mcduster705 I’m not sure I just know this is going on cause me and some buddies had the same conversation about the jays, leafs and raptors playing and then someone was like “oh yeah TFC and the Rock are playing too gonna do a Toronto parlay” lolPhilly we kickin your a…again today @RaptorsEast -

He actually thought that his 76ers could beat the Raptors.

But I don't want this season to end. This @Raptors team has been one of my favourites. They hustle, and play unselfish.

Also picked up Raptors +164 to win the series, shout-out to @CLTHornetsball and @MyBookie for providing the best price. LETS GO! https://t.co/6husehWrw8@SpencerKeele 1) The 76ers can’t have both Embiid and Harden on the floor at the same time for 48 minutes, and the Raptors have killed them this year when either one of them is off the court

2) Thybulle out away games

3) Nurse &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Doc

It’ll be close but I give Toronto a great shot@LordMoriori @DeanScorpion_ @sixers @NBCSPhilly @espn @975TheFanatic @Raptors @Ticketmaster @betPARX Sixers in 4@Raptors @TangerineHoops Siakam has to step up in these games in game 1 kinda want him to score 25+ as he is our leading scorer.

Lol.  Thanks for the title, but really feeling like Kawhi doesn’t actually like to play bball 🤷🏻‍♂️. Just a thought @NBA #NBAPlayoffs #nba @timandfriends should explore 🤷🏻‍♂️Nick Thibodeau has been burning the Raptors out like they have been in the playoff since November, and despite the odds, they are here and healthy (ish).

The tiny matter of not even wishing him well—or Paul George with COVID-19–speaks lowly of your miserable life. Get one.@LAClippers As an honest Clippers fan I think I speak on behalf of all of us when I say that we're not good.

Would give negative stars but I can’t. The only people who think this would be a good trade are Laker fans wanting to get rid of Westbrook.@sp_136_Rp @Raptors it was! i was confused at first but the dinosaurs were all screaming “let’s go raptors” so then it made senseBHMS is grateful and cheering for @Raptors this weekend!
