#FreePicks https://t.co/nDNOTrpoLg@SimsTazmon @cavs Even if that’s the case my brotha, the @cavs can provide us a release from reality win or lose. Agree with everything else though."We have to play with that underdog mentality that we've had to put ourselves in the position we're in."

JB Bickerstaff expects the @Cavs to keep up the intensity through the second half of the season as the playoffs approach. 

#LetEmKnow https://t.co/O4cehX2tcn@cavs @firstenergycorp This team is gonna go on a run when they are finally fully healthy. Exciting to have Lauri back@cavs @firstenergycorp I don't hate this. Welcome back Lauri &amp; get well soon Darius &amp; Caris!@bV2510_ if you mean, how every bit of news sends everyone into a frenzy and we used to just be able to sit back and watch the games and discuss them... i agree.

 @cavs will be fine, they are a 1-15 squad, not a top-heavy squad, so next man up.

 #GoCavs@cavs @firstenergycorp Lot of shot creators there 🤮@FrobIey @cavs @firstenergycorp backup ig@cavs @firstenergycorp Start Goodwin@cavs @firstenergycorp Triple Towers right there.@cavs @firstenergycorp Rondo start is still a W so let’s get it@cavs @firstenergycorp LAURRIII THE LEGEND@cavs @firstenergycorp Wheres goodwin@cavs @firstenergycorp Holy WThe Starting 🖐️ in Detroit! #LetEmKnow https://t.co/n6KGhEasOn@DevaronPerry i think he may mean;

  @cavs strength is they are 1-15, not top heavy.

  with a young team every moment is a new experience, this will only make them stronger.

@MarkkanenLauri is playing tonight! #LetEmKnow https://t.co/4J886yBP2W@ThatBakerFan @cavs I mean we're all like this 🤣🤷🏾‍♂️@cavs So why the hell in did he play in a meaningless all star game when if his back was hurting so damn bad and now out for the team when they are in a playoff race?Back to NBA 🏀🏀🏀

Don’t like betting my team but my @cavs are without Garland and LeVert tonight, and on road in Detroit.

With that being said CAVS struggle for points without Garland setting table.  Look for UNDER.

CAVS/Pistons UNDER 209 for 1 stack! 💵

Good luck!

Do Cavs a big favor and don't go ruining what they got going just so you can try to get credit like it's because of your return. A true ring and credit chaser.#LetEmKnow coach J.B. Bickerstaff said All-Star G @dariusgarland22 is “frustrated” about being held out of games to rest his sore back “but he knows what we’re doing is best for the long term.

Not the same as playing 33 minutes of real basketball@CLETommy @NotEvanMobley @cavs They’ll probably remove it I have a feelingCleveland Cavaliers point guard Darius Garland said that the Chicago Bulls are a really good team.

Garland: "They have a lot of veterans that are really good. Zach and DeMar are holding it down."

He's pretty talented@twithersAP Just how I imagined it. @cavs can't catch a break.@TheKennyRoda @cavs Strongly disagree. Let him enjoy the moment. Nothing is guaranteed that he will ever be an all star again.

Cleveland Cavaliers
Memphis Grizzlies
Phoenix Suns
Golden State Warriors
Minnesota Timberwolves
Toronto RaptorsThe tailgate experience is by far more exciting than the game itself in person. These days both cost about the same to attend per home game. 

I’ll go see the @cavs in person and watch the #Browns from home/work.@KenCarman @Gbush91 no matter how good the #Browns are or will be, the @cavs are a better bang for your buck. 

NFL games are not that entertaining in person as NBA games are. 

Those who attend Browns games on the regular will continue to do so no matter price increase.The bigger issue is that this is ongoing. The last @Cavs game was 9 days ago and Garland played. He participated in every part of All-Star Weekend. Yet, after 4 days off, he is not playing? https://t.co/JLuBvO5AxE@Moncler @cavs @DanielArsham @Thanasis_ante43 @DejounteMurray Absolutely disgusting service

distract you from the fact that the historic 73-9 2015-2016 Golden State Warriors, featuring unanimous MVP Steph Curry, blew a 3-1 lead to LeBron James and the 2015-16 Cleveland Cavaliers in the 2016 NBA Finals.@alec_kwait @HARPER04_5 @cavs How about promotion of Lebron James’s friend Kobe Altman to President of Basketball Operations …Lauri Markkanen eager to help Cleveland Cavaliers’ second-half playoff push following ankle injury https://t.co/WEdOXNtGVS Having Markkanen as a shooting threat should allow Allen and Mobley to have an advantage in the low post.@MikeyP422 @ZipsMBB @MACSports @MarchMadnessMBB @RMFieldHouse @cavs @JohnGroce @Zips_United @AkronZips The Best Rivalry in the MAC! https://t.co/k3B61BYZvqI have been telling people @BrandonWeems10 was https://t.co/E5CDDQgUwk with the @Cavs the past two years 🤷🏿‍♂️ Glad it is official. #AkronProud https://t.co/srF7OiG34RFunny how the 35-23 Cavs get no national coverage, but speculation of LeBron coming back to Cleveland in 1.5 years is all everyone is talking about now. @cavs #NBATwitter #Cavs@FashionTVNetwor @DwitjustinGilas @cavs @kevinlove @MarkkanenLauri @LamarStevens11 Hope you’re right lol@DavidZavac @cavs (Seriously trade him before everyone realizes what is happening).@egoldie80 on the @Browns @bakermayfield @cavs &amp; @KingJames future.

Opposite of Okoro tbh.@DrewMagoto @DwitjustinGilas @cavs @kevinlove @MarkkanenLauri @LamarStevens11 Wrong, now they know this is not the Pistons team from earlier.
They have more than enough to beat this team with defense.@DavidZavac @cavs We can have him for basically free in the second right?@karnsies817 He built a rubbish roster in LA, full of washed stars - and is now trying to finesse his way back onto the bandwagon team that is our @cavs 

Don't buy into it Nick.Huge congratulations to Walsh Cavalier Legend, @BrandonWeems10 for being named Assistant GM for the Cleveland @cavs! https://t.co/w7t9Qqlgz0Coming off his 1st All-Star Game, @_bigjayy_ returns to business with full confidence.
