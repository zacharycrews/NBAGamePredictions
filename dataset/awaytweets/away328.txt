https://t.co/3eBdeOfCpB@Bucks We all wish him a successful and speedy recovery and at least we are still in good hands.That doesn't mean that the Bucks will get the exception granted, or that they'll even apply for it. Adding that much salary results in an enormous tax penalty, plus Milwaukee would need to open another roster spot.

Those other Eastern Conference teams don’t put fear in nobody’s heart.Giannis Antetokounmpo hit 40 points and made the game winner with two seconds left to guide the Milwaukee Bucks to a 127-125 win over the Charlotte Hornets.

Brook was a MAJOR part of MIL's success winning the title last year.

If you just want to win, best shot in the league to take is at the rim. This game winner is as impressive as any other. Can’t punish a guy for taking a higher quality shot.@NateBigBoy69 @kingkuyk @JoeMama360 @DavidVe64270691 @dark_769_ @NBA @Bucks People say his game winner isn’t impressive, because he drove it to the rack for a left handed layup. That doesn’t “look” as pretty as a deep contested 3 pointer. But you know what it is: it’s simply more effective and a better quality shot.@NateBigBoy69 @kingkuyk @JoeMama360 @DavidVe64270691 @dark_769_ @NBA @Bucks He has the leagues best handles for his size. He is an elite passer, an all world defensive player, he’s got post moves for days now and even a jump shot now. That’s all skill.@NateBigBoy69 @kingkuyk @JoeMama360 @DavidVe64270691 @dark_769_ @NBA @Bucks If all it took to me successful and dominate is to be tall and try hard, every 7 footer in the nba would be this good.
