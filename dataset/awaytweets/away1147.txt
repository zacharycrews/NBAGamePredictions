Brooklyn Nets vs Milwaukee Bucks

The Bucks are second in the East. They have won 7 of their last 10 games to pull closer to the Miami Heat.📈

The Nets also got to a 130-123 win against the Detroit Pistons on Tuesday. Kevin Durant scored 41 points.🔥 https://t.co/uTodq8VphbThe Brooklyn Nets will host the Milwaukee Bucks tonight. https://t.co/cN0ZT9hEZNNBA Player Prop Bet🏀
Brooklyn Nets - Milwaukee Bucks

Kevin Durant O30.5 Points @ 1.90 ($100)

Big match for the Nets here, with their playoff hopes in the balance. Durant will play 35+ mins, so I expect him to smash the boards.

DROP A LIKE IF TAILING❤❤❤ https://t.co/9Bhor8llP3@247KevinG @Clarkpojo I said at their peak, meaning at full health. They beat Milwaukee in the regular season because the Bucks couldn't stop the Jazz's 3 point attempts with their drop defense. Obviously though they weren't full health so this is all speculation 😁All this just to lose to the @Bucks in the NBA finals 🤦🏼‍♂️ https://t.co/5O1ygupiMSThe @Bucks are 9-3 ATS in their last 12 games 👀

Problem was, Yi’s agent had told the Bucks not to draft him

The reason being the small Chinese-American population in Milwaukee

Additionally, China wouldn’t allow Yi to go to a team that didn’t give him sufficient play timeDorian Finney-Smith sets a new career-high (28) in points after that drive and finish.
