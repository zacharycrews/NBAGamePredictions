Brooklyn Nets vs Milwaukee Bucks

The Bucks are second in the East. They have won 7 of their last 10 games to pull closer to the Miami Heat.üìà

The Nets also got to a 130-123 win against the Detroit Pistons on Tuesday. Kevin Durant scored 41 points.üî• https://t.co/uTodq8VphbThe Brooklyn Nets will host the Milwaukee Bucks tonight. https://t.co/cN0ZT9hEZNNBA Player Prop BetüèÄ
Brooklyn Nets - Milwaukee Bucks

Kevin Durant O30.5 Points @ 1.90 ($100)

Big match for the Nets here, with their playoff hopes in the balance. Durant will play 35+ mins, so I expect him to smash the boards.

DROP A LIKE IF TAILING‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§ https://t.co/9Bhor8llP3@247KevinG @Clarkpojo I said at their peak, meaning at full health.
