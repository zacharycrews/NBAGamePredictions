Remember when I said their defense wouldn't suck in the preseason? Well, they are league average or better in each of the four factors, and No. 6 overall at the moment. The low turnovers and high free throw rate on offense help by slowing pace.The Bulls are bringing fun back to Chicago, one 360 dunk at a time https://t.co/mJIY3jDnu0Anyone like this .@chicagobulls #Combo haha 🔥 https://t.co/8jOTLYuTzt@ryenarussillo @Spotify @chicagobulls @adamamin @Twitter @BenjaminSolak I think you do amazing work and I love your pod.

So there's that.@drawing_defense @WilliamBabbel @kirkgoldsberry @TheWarriorsTalk @warriors @utahjazz @MiamiHEAT @WashWizards @chicagobulls There is a lot more wisdom on that team now and hopefully his positioning (which imo was his biggest problem) will be much better as a result.
