Luckily for me travel isn't an issue since I don't live far from downtown Toronto, the real question is ticket prices. The Jays and Raptors are pretty affordable which is nice. The Leafs on the other hand? Yeah, no thanks, not at those prices.@Raptors @ScottBarnes561 Day #1 replying to Raptors admin until I get a follow@william_lou I listen to the podcast every day, you said earlier this week abolish the west coast games...man, 10:30pm start tonight? I'm too old to be up that late. I feel too old to make it to the end of a Raptors game that starts at 7pm. Who in Toronto is watching these games?Are the @Raptors going to make it 5 wins in a row tonight when they take on the @LAClippers? 🤔

#WeTheNorth@dallasmavs and @sixers will do @Raptors sid if they both win tonight so that no pressure later vs Clips @jv19tholeI want the Celtics, idgaf. I wouldn’t say that they’re favourites in any matchup but Raptors can give any team in the east a run for their money.

If the season ended today, the Nets would play the Raptors in Toronto without Kyrie.

His return date is still uncertain. #toronto #raptors@EthanScheck @AlprenSENDGOONS Yeah, I think most Raptors fans wanted Mobley in the draft. Quite a few would still take him over Scottie. But no-one in Detroit, Cleveland and Toronto is unhappy with their choice. Really, it should be a 3-way tie for ROY.@Faraiiiii @natashadye @LAClippers @Raptors “I could do that, it’s so easy”
