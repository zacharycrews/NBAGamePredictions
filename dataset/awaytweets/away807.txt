 boys@hhpthebook @nyknicks It's really amazing the position we are in as a team and people are speaking up for his antics@shinjorocks @nyknicks Yes the Riley led @nyknicks were when the Knicks were the talk of the town and the main event every night - Van Gundy as well- since then? Mostly a disaster@hhpthebook @nyknicks Have not seen a narrative a feel-good story change any faster.@KendraRandle_ Hi Kendra I'm always standing with number 30 @J30_RANDLE he's one of my favorites on my favorite team the Knicks never listen to what other people say on the media or espn it's poison I love you guys the Randle family forever always new york forever ‚ù§I said I wasn't going to say anything about a certain guy on the @nyknicks till after the trade deadline. But somebody said ya boy was trying to fight an Asst coach on the bench.  And had to be pushed away. Yo, we went from "We here" to "Get out of here" real quick! https://t.co/fedOzWlOZ8@TheNBACentral @NYPost_Berman Maybe @knicks should be getting rid of Tom Thibodeau instead of Cam. If i am your boss and i make a trade for a good player that can help the team, and you are deliberately not playing him i don't want you as my coach. @KnicksFanTv .  @nyknicks are going nowhere with Thibbs@bdewaalmalefyt @nyknicks @craigcartonlive @BillSimmons Why the hell would the jazz do that?!Aye @nyknicks can y‚Äôall fire thibs, why the hell he not playing cam tf is wrong with that guy? #NBA@AshNicoleMoss I cant stand Kendrick Perkins he's a fucking clown that says Julius Randle should leave new york hid relationship is broken with the Knicks I say no its not espn is trash I can't listen to that garbageYou got 3 more days fellas @nyknicks https://t.co/Qd117cx8Rt@AkieLeroy @nyknicks I was gone tweet this earlier.@TheNBACentral @AhnFireDigital Can we get this scrub outta NY already !? .. dude choked in the playoffs and hasn‚Äôt been showing up ALL season ‚Ä¶ WE can do better @nyknicks@KendraRandle_ @J30_RANDLE I hear the same garbage what people say on TV on espn about Julius Randle they say he should leave new york and shouldn't be on the Knicks well I say he's a great player and belongs on the KnicksWhen are we going to start holding Randle accountable, @nyknicks? This type of behavior will only cause further damage to a season that is slipping away. Either hold Randle responsible for his actions or trade him by Thursday‚Äôs deadline. https://t.co/AAJM1Zt6QT@jr_xxi maybe if you listened to your coaching staff or as you call em in New York 'stat nerds' you wouldn't be a 30 Loss team under .500 lmao New York ain't a basketball city it just has a lot of people who support the best teams in the league then revert Knicks when they're watchable..New York Knicks: Knicks' Kemba Walker will be rested Monday vs. Jazz https://t.co/vT2pwffTPFüî∂üî∑GAMEDAYüî∂üî∑

Next year they could go back to being terrible like we did lol but them having WAY better draft positions/picks does help.@nyknicks Sorry to say get rid of Tom.RUMOR: Tom Thibodeau did not even want Cam Reddish on his team. The Knicks gave away a first-round pick and Kevin Knox to Atlanta.

Reddish wanted to leave the Hawks for more minutes. He is now averaging 6 MPG in New York vs his 26 MPG in ATL.Mark Jackson is right there @nyknicks https://t.co/Q0MrExxUtm@TravisGoated @Gunzinger1312 @nyknicks Our Knicks will absolutely dominate the league for years to comeKnick her @nyknicks https://t.co/SXIjVmxxuY@nyknicks please trade this man lol smh he‚Äôs suppose to be the guy but won‚Äôt even look at the data to help his team win?!?

That said if we play smart like we did the first half in LA, better shot at a win. If Randle does that knucklehead üí© he did to start the 3rd we‚Äôre toast. I feel better Kemba isn‚Äôt playing.@HereComesTurco @ProperMIDDLEMAN You're right. Everyone wants to put the blame on him when the NEW YORK KNICKS cannot attract talent better than him. Blame the organization for creating a culture where his level of talent is the pinnacle. Throwing stones in a glass house.Whether a Julius Randle trade is to be expected later on (maybe) or by this deadline (2/10) I think New York will have to move him if they expect to make a run at Zion.

Knicks can either;
1. Trade Randle for Fox or McCollum (now)
2. 2023/2024 and use him in sign&amp;trade for ZionNBA:üèÄ

 https://t.co/yy7xGkMXCp@nyknicks Still waiting on Thibs to explain why Quickley was benched after just 5 minutes of the Lakers game. He‚Äôs been in foul trouble b4 &amp; Thibs didn‚Äôt benched him. Can‚Äôt be bcuz he shot a lot bcuz he only shot 1 time. Can‚Äôt be his defense bcuz that‚Äôs how he got the 3 fouls. So why?Marc Berman of the New York Post reports that Tom Thibodeau was not on board with trading for Cam Reddish.

Reddish has played just three games with the Knicks so far:
https://t.co/SMEj5deMNR@ckliio9 @nyknicks So happy it made it there! Pleas enjoy the read!@nyknicks We don‚Äôt want to watch Randle play anymore even if he turns into prime MJ. Trade him. We want to see Cam play for his contract. If you won‚Äôt play him, then don‚Äôt waste that mans career on the bench. Trade him too. He deserves a chance.@JustinLeise @NBA @nyknicks Do u not see it's a step thru shot?NBA Game Preview: The Utah Jazz have a forecast 54% chance to win against The New York Knicks with a spread of -1/1 and an over/under of 226.
