The first touch of the ball doesn't meet the definition of a dribble.@WaddleandSilvy @TWaddle87 Also, @ScottiePippen can't stop contradicting himself. @chicagobulls couldn't win w/Collins, until Phil got there; later Phil is "racist." The other night, he was complaining that Barkley and the Rockets 'superteam' didn't want to win bad enough, but MJ wanted it too badly? Etc. https://t.co/MTzLQEtr0WGreat Victory Today.

https://t.co/aww6G7XagII’m so pumped for the @chicagobulls game! LFG!!!🏀 I hope the Boyz didn’t party too hard last night and got that rest in. #LALALand@KarenSHamilton @ScottiePippen But you are correct that Scottie was awesome!! He really was. I grew up in Chicago. Bulls fan since 1980. Ricky Sobers was my favorite Bull before 1984. Then came MJ and he was simply magical. By 88' (Scottie's rookie year) he was in the convo for best player in the league.@27_blake @chicagobulls Your team can definitely take the Clips. We almost had em but we blew the lead.Ugh!

[via r/chicagobulls Nov 14, 2014 #Bulls]The Chicago Bulls say that guard Coby White will not make his season debut tonight. 

White is nearing a return after having left shoulder surgery in the offseason.If the Chicago Bulls lose tonight, I will put whatever the top comment says in my bio for 3 daysIf somebody has to say it, I will…

Shut up, @ScottiePippen!!
Be upset all you want. Make a documentary if you want. But everyone knows MJ was/is the greatest and the @chicagobulls wouldn’t and didn’t and haven’t won a championship with MJ.

Whooooo!@KendallG13 @Stacey21King@stephenasmith Pippen claimed, Jordan was a scorer. 
See, very important, to pay attention 
to details. Look at Jordan resume and
look at Scottie resume. Jordan was an
elite player, on offense and defense,
for Chicago Bulls. Who have the best 
resume, out of the two?  I know, its a 
team sport. https://t.co/d0atiDoumu@okcthunder @BrooklynNets @hornets @warriors @LAClippers @chicagobulls Check out the best betting tips for @NBA only at: https://t.co/rKBe30dYqlLonzo vs PG matchup should be great Paul don’t call for help he’s like that @ZO2_ and @chicagobulls gotta be ready and focused! https://t.co/ptLLsyGoyfLet it be known @jacksonmahomes has no authority to represent the Chicago Bulls.

-Clippers have an elite defense ranking top 5 in the entire league. 
-Chicago falls just behind that at tied for 6th.
