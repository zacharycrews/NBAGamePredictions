They are only getting started!@_KingSain @justgrindhard @chicagobulls Their bench shouldn't worry you right now. They're running a 9 man rotation and a 10 man with Coby White healthy. Always having a starter on the floor to keep up the flow. The bench has come up big in some key games so far. They're still young@hometownjg @ZO2_ @chicagobulls Must watch TV. 💯@chicagobulls @UneeQ_ @DeMar_DeRozan @ZO2_ CPT and up in the hills right next to chino@_KingSain @chicagobulls I wouldn't even say that they just some secret weapons waiting to shine@chicagobulls @DeMar_DeRozan @ZO2_ Compton and Chino Hills together you know you in trouble.@justgrindhard @chicagobulls Them folks cold af too.

Do great this year. Amazing, I’m talking ECF at least. I want them to taste the Championship, but fall short in a G7. 

Team sticks around and develops in the summer. 

THEN, D-Rose returns and leads the Bulls to a chip.

#NBA75 #NBA #NBATwitter https://t.co/nMWNgBD0WO@SportsTalkJMN @BullsArchive @ScottiePippen @chicagobulls @NBAHistory Teams have more than one leader. Scottie is the one that the teammates talked to and he was the one that made sure they were all engaged and involved in the game. Everyone else was beneath MJ. They were just his “supporting cast.” Scottie was the one who rallied them.@statmuse @chicagobulls @DeMar_DeRozan @ZachLaVine @ZO2_ They lost to a Sixers team with 8 players twice.Check out 1990-91 Fleer #26 Michael Jordan UER/(Led NBA in scoring 4 years, not 3)  #ChicagoBulls https://t.co/kejNREDwAN via @eBayNikola Vucevic glad DeMar DeRozan joined the Bulls in offseason #ChicagoBulls #DeMarDeRozan #NikolaVucevic https://t.co/byq7uWyi8IThe @warriors went into Brooklyn tonight &amp; showed the @BrooklynNets how good they really are!!
