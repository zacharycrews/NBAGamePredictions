Entering the day, Golden State was 0-432 when trailing by 16 with fewer than 8 minutes to play over the last 25 seasons.

We can't compete like this, it's not good enough. Period.The only reason the @warriors will get a guaranteed playoff spot is because the T-Wolves will lose one more game, helping them to back in. It's honestly sad. #DubNation #UTAvsGSWPlease win golden state warriors@warriors Um‚Ä¶We are watching NCAAGET A FUCKING CENTER @warriors  #UTAvsGSWImagine if we have a center @warriorsyou stink @warriorsIf the @warriors offer Wiggins another contract they would be FOOLS.
