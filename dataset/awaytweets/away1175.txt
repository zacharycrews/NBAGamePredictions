Lots of guys would have fit that bill. #Warriors@warriors @NBCSAuthentic @957thegame @betwayusa Lock inUnfortunately this comes before my @warriors are set to take on the @SacramentoKings at @Golden1Center tonight at 6 pm.

Elite rebounder, has a decent paint game, can set screens, understands the system. Cousins is a pure offensive center which is not what we want.@ecf08 @_CoronaLime_ @warriors @Verizon Cousins is washed and isn’t very good at defense. In terms of offense, we don’t need a center. We need a center that can grab those offensive/defensive rebounds and contest/block. Cousins is not that guy.

They now have a one-game lead over the Mavs for the 3-seed@AppleJakes @warriors @juanonjuan10 @andre I stand corrected lol the Jazz are who weve known they were lol@haikucfc @warriors No need nothing will happenThe #Jazz once were up 25 on the Warriors Saturday night. They led by 16 with six minutes left.

They ended up watching Golden State go on an 18-0 run in a three-minute span.

What's going on with the Jazz?

🆕️ @Tjonesonthenba with the words. #TakeNote

https://t.co/xFxIG5nRDi@denzzmcfc2 @warriors Telling me to touch grass won't make warriors reach the finals@KDTrey5 I read an article that you said you deserve to have your number retired by #goldenstatewarriors. That’s such #BS. You went looking for a ring and you got one. Now you’re in Bklyn and you haven’t produced one there. Go home and cry in your towel@warriors @GLeagueWarriors Just like the good ole days when the dynasty Dubs and G League Warriors would go into the postseason together 😩🤞@warriors These box scores reflect where Warriors need to be scoring wise while Steph is out to win. Rarely have we seen theses numbers from all of the above, except maybe Poole. That 10pts from Dray is critical, as is teams believing he will actually shoot.@warriors Congratulations 🎉 Dubs in Playoffs😊🏀 𝗚𝗔𝗠𝗘𝗗𝗔𝗬 🏀

@StephenCurry30 @KlayThompson@warriors We needed that comeback victory. Kudos to @Money23Green  for swishing those two FT’s at the end with confidence. Utah had some bad, unforced error TO’s in the 4th. We capitalized with Klay hitting some key 3’s and JP being as strong as ever. Loved Wiggs confidence.

I miss watching the final four at a reasonable time. One of the big takeaways was how bad both teams ran out-of-bounds plays...they should copy some of the plays from Golden State Warriors.Last night, the Warriors trailed the Jazz by 16 points with 7:54 remaining.

Entering the day, Golden State was 0-432 when trailing by 16 with fewer than 8 minutes to play over the last 25 seasons.

They are now 1-432, as the Jazz blow their third 20-point lead of the season. https://t.co/ITJ697Ys3x@warriors You beat the Jazz 😂@warriors @kpthrive Alhamdulillah!

Who said the dynasty was over?To whom it concerns @warriors PLEASEEEE you can't start Poole on the bench once 30 comes back. Work out that rotation that keeps JP as an effective scorer and so far this season, thats when he's a starter. Please don't screw up this chemistry. And please give him Q4 mins too.Golden State Warriors Legacy91

The refs are placing bets and the @NBAOfficial is doing nothing. Investigate and you will see the mafia that they have established@warriors STOP JINXING EVERY DAMN TIME@warriors OPJ seems a step slower or not reacting to the ball with confidence. A liability at defense for now. Maybe try someone else tonight. JK? He needs a tuneup game for the playoffs.If the @warriors don’t a least 50 games this yr Steve Kerr officially fucking sucks as a coach and @Money23Green needs to look to score a little bit more while he still on that teamToasted at the @warriors game… https://t.co/UXPZTFWqVu@warriors Management needs to hire new coaches to teach the players how to make a lay-up, and how to pass the ball to a Warrior for next season.  Green also needs  a lot of help on passing the ball and lay-ups.  This season is sad toast. Too much sloppy play all season long!!@KlayThompson @warriors go off for 35+ and win this gameY’all don’t even upset me no more I know when it be ugly @warriors@warriors U are nearly as a ok team@DogSurfRoadshow @warriors Hey Cyrus , can you see how this defense improves with playoffs on horizon.

#BamBam #GOT7
#BamBamxGSW #DubNation https://t.co/1mUXzBtBx1@warriors this team is trash without steph...maldito golden state warriors@warriors Steph or no Steph - Our guys just can't get it done. While players were injured, slumping, bricking game to game, on hiatus or whatever - all the other title contenders made adjustments and got BETTER- we've regressed. We can't compete like this, it's not good enough. Period.The only reason the @warriors will get a guaranteed playoff spot is because the T-Wolves will lose one more game, helping them to back in. It's honestly sad. #DubNation #UTAvsGSWPlease win golden state warriors@warriors Um…We are watching NCAAGET A FUCKING CENTER @warriors  #UTAvsGSWImagine if we have a center @warriorsyou stink @warriorsIf the @warriors offer Wiggins another contract they would be FOOLS. Kuminga could do that same for 1/4 of the price@warriors how draymond miss all those easy layups evreytime@warriors The Warriors might make it to the play in game. They are a bad team right now. No beautiful basketball anymore. Another wasted season. Coach Kerr cannot motivate these guy.@warriors Whelp! Green can't even make lay ups! my goodness.@warriors @SteveKerr only if the squad had a young athletic big they could run to for offense. *KUMINGA* 

too bad steve kerr is a stupid demented old man. dumbass doesn’t know how to win basketball games@warriors u’re actually pathetic without steph@GoIdenState @warriors Gleague team without curry@warriors I’m not watching any game until Steph returns 😒@warriors Shutcho mouth admin https://t.co/Ak4baf5FAo@warriors what happened to curry?@warriors I really am rooting for the Dubs. But I’ll just accept it that they are not winning the chip anymore.WTF YALL DOING @warriors https://t.co/wjsody1AtE@warriors Without Curry this Warriors team is one of the worst team in NBA. Klay, Dray, Wiggs can help the team to get some wins.@warriors Down by 40 again 🤣🤣🤣After the @warriors trimmed the @utahjazz lead to just 6, the Jazz have answered with a 12-2 run and lead 99-83 with 9:24 left in the game. 

These are the types of answers the Jazz have been missing in blown lead losses. 

#TakeNote 

https://t.co/0EvPPAsn6I@warriors body language on the time out at 9:24 in the 4th quarter says everything.@GavinCurrin @warriors We Klay, Poole and Wiggins, should have been enough to win most games of the last of the season 😪@warriors I want my best man 💖 to come 🫴 back I'm sorry @StephenCurry30 with the shot's I guess the team loosing it without you@warriors Nice one@flyingsavvy @warriors I can’t watch anymore.😭2022 UNC &gt;&gt;&gt;2015-2016 Golden State Warriors@warriors 16 points utah lead@warriors, at this point, they will be lucky to be a top seed in the Play In.

Jazz 21 point second quarter lead is down to 6 with 12 minutes left to play. 

Jazz outscored 36-29 in the third quarter.

The Jazz have been able to answer every Warrior run thus far — we'll see if they can do it again.

All star my ass. @warriors Let him go he's wasting you're guys money. Can't do anything and is lazy as hell. Has no passion for the game just a total bust. Should've kept @Dloading.@warriors As usual painful to watch,klay being the 1st option and still inefficient,bad defense  esp on pick and roll and drives, turnovers,offense stagnant or design for klay,, JP tried to make a run but turnovers stalled them.just awful to watch.Golden State Warriors - Utah Jazz

#GoldenStateWarriors #UtahJazz #nucypher #nu #tipster https://t.co/Nap8tcszPSThe view of the @warriors ain’t bad from here either 💙💛💙💛💙💛 https://t.co/M8HWraIZ4j@warriors This game shows the importance of having 2 elite guards in Curry and Poole. This is why I believe Poole is the perfect backup to Curry. The 2nd unit has 0 offense with Poole as a starter.@warriors need more players to step up..@warriors poole can't do everything dude@warriors Need more from everyone not named Jordan Poole, especially defense. Utah hangs 58 at the half. C'mon Dubs! 🏀🏀🏀💪🏾💪🏾💪🏾👟👟👟@J4xDJM Because he’s made the playoffs more years he had a 6 year streak top 5 in MVP voting and he took on the great Golden State warriors and was the only player besides Lebron that constantly gave him problems. He never beat them but if you look at those teams he was over achieving.Finally back at Chase for a Dubs game #dubnation @warriors@warriors Guys are sleeping on the floor be ready at all times. Roll to rim more pick up the Defense and stay Aggressive let’s go Guys Defense and move the ball@warriors need an FIRE AND COMEBACK COMPLETE AND A WIN 2ND HALF@warriors Curry won't be around to carry the team forever.... it's time to get some ballers in....@warriors Not our night with a TOP 15 Coach@warriors Poole better then klay btw@BurnerMoves @warriors You watching games? His shots all off of screens. Igudala came in and exacerbated the loss.@warriors This team was overhyped earlier in the season lmao. Maybe we are losing the remaining games of the season.

We are getting down by the jazz at home are you for real!!
You better wake up in 3rd and 4th quarter before it's too late@warriors Y’all disgust me https://t.co/y4TyIJ2AcAJordan Poole and Klay Thompson combine for 31 PTS in the first half, but Utah Jazz's offensive firepower, led by Donovan Mitchell's 17, gives them a 58-45 lead over the Golden State Warriors at halftime.@RatiodbyJordan @warriors Wtf you gonna do bro😭😭At the half the @utahjazz lead the @warriors 58-45. 

Jazz led by as much as 21 midway through the second quarter but the Warriors chipped away at it pretty quickly. 

https://t.co/EMAWzJLMnA@warriors I mean turnovers are the killers and the second unit need to come big... they costly allowed more points and didn't score@warriors we need to get steals Contest shots and we need to get an Offense and others need to Score, i know we can win it lets go warriors #DubNation@warriors JP should wear Curry’s running shoes@warriors Yalls dont deserve jp and steph free them@warriors @NBCSAuthentic Trade Wiggins in summer pleaseeee@warriors Tell klay to stop dribblingYo mfn @warriors  can we get back into the damn game we going into halftime down 13 This is a big GAME@warriors just end the game already@warriors Wiggins smh 🤦🏻‍♂️ https://t.co/33ORsxo2BR@warriors Bjelica isn't really thriving in this game...

Where are you Myers?  Still hiding?@warriors Not are night?HALFTIME: Jazz 58, Warriors 45. A couple late stops (and a couple Warriors turnovers) and a transition layup from Bogey give Utah some breathing room. Don 17p. Bogey/Conley/JC 9p. Poole 19p and Thompson 12p for Golden State.@warriors Tell klay to relax more, and take his time pleaseUtah leads the Warriors 58-45 at halftime. Golden State was about to disappear into oblivion until Jordan Poole dragged them back into the game.

Poole: 19 points, 3 rebounds
Thompson: 12 points (5-12)
Wiggins: 7 points (3-6)

Jazz made 9 3s in the first half, Dubs made 8.@chavezlupe640 @warriors @NBCSAuthentic @957thegame @Adobe The second unit allowed most point and they scored none@warriors Bro why Klay form look like that? 😂@warriors It’s Jordan Poole or nothingAt the half, Golden State down 58-45.
