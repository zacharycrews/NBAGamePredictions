#ClipperNation #WeAreTheValley #NBA #Sportsbetting https://t.co/LD7fDhHnQO4/6/80 – The Phoenix #Suns took the First Round best-of-3 series 2-1 over the KC Kings w/a 114-99 win in PHX (a non-sellout which was blacked out locally), to move onto the Semifinals v the Lakers. KC opened the game up 11p, but 19p/20r from Alvan Adams led the way. #ValleyProud https://t.co/N2wokr8bhQ@Suns thanks for the final nail in the coffin and puttin us @Lakers outta our misery@suns_tutu_fan @Santinobambino3 @Suns @ModernRockstars i think fridayModel prediction NBA 🚨
Score prediction (Suns/Clips)

Suns 112
Clips 110

Phoenix +2.5 61% chance of covering this spread 🔥

Under 226.5  58% chance 

So if your looking to bet NBA the model likes Phoenix +2.5 and the under 😇

Good Luck 🤩

Also as someone who had the under, I was happy they didn’t score lol@Suns @CarlsJr Can we get a sponsorship of something healthy like get a fee salad and go?@AschNBA says the Phoenix Suns are the team to beat in the chase for this year’s NBA title https://t.co/SfBwDblzf5@Suns @BALLYSPORTSAZ @DevinBook Love this so much@DhavaliLama @Suns @Lakers What are you guys going to focus your energy on for the next 6 months?I got the Phoenix Suns winning the NBA Championship this seasonWhy is everyone hating on the @Suns ????
@Lakers are trash PERIOD. Pelinka you are the boss don’t let these “star” players tell you what to do!Thank you, @SunsAfter historic 63rd win, the Phoenix Suns’ Devin Booker gives Al McCoy autographed jersey.

* after historic 63rd wind, Phoenix Suns’ Frank Kaminsky hands his valet receipt to @Vincemarotta and asks him to “bring my car around.“
@Bickley_MarottaThe @NBA needs to investigate the @Suns for last night's blatant point shaving!

With 1:40 to go, the Suns were up 19 pts. The rest of the game, they had 0 pts and 3 turnovers. Meanwhile, they let THE LAKERS score 8 pts to cover the spread...

@Suns currently have the best record in the league
The @BrooklynNets are the 8th seed and the Lakers completely missed the playoffs.

Hopefully this marks the end of the super team era in the NBA.After the Lakers suffered a first-round exit to the Phoenix Suns in last year’s playoffs, the franchise acquired Russell Westbrook via trade to help LeBron James and Anthony Davis win a second title in three years.

That move proved costly – both literally and figuratively https://t.co/QRPaUY4sagSuns fans know better than to trust history and trends… Phoenix has been in the league the longest without a single championship so it’s time to make history!

#NBA #losangeles #Lakers #eliminated https://t.co/pbOGSa9qrw@Puppygun1223 I want my hometown Phoenix Suns to win an NBA championship.Is it too much to ask highly paid players to make at least 10 points in a game. I mean it should be a no brainer.. a requirement.. SMH @CP3 Why aren't you allowed to shoot the ball? Basically just assisting others. Seems wrong.. @Suns coaches what a shame to not let him shoot 😒@Suns Epic season LFGPhoenix Suns set franchise record for wins, end Lakers playoff hopes https://t.co/8OTKbk0xEyhow ? not his fault that his team cant beat "anyone" with or without him.

#RallyTheValley https://t.co/lqcUevbXLjThe Phoenix Suns https://t.co/UiHIpcvcQiLakers have had 23 FTs thru 3 quarters and @Suns? We’ve had 8. Make it make sense. 🤷🏻‍♀️ #ValleyProud #NBA75@Suns @DevinBook Enjoy the regular season first round exit frauds 🤡Suns lead the Lakers after three 98-80.

Phoenix went ballistic in the third, outscoring LA 35-22. Booker poured in 16 PTS alone. Suns are 12 minutes away from their franchise record and LA's elimination. 

Booker: 32/4/6, 6-9 3Ps
Ayton: 22/2/13

Paul: 6/12/4@Jumpshot8 @Suns @Lakers @DevinBook These are the moments I live for #byebyeLakersThe Suns were +13 (35-22) in the 3rd Quarter to lead the Lakers 98-80 after three. Phoenix is shooting 53 percent. 32/6/4 on 12-22 for Devin Booker.

Phoenix blew this game open in the third, continuing the momentum that they closed the first half with. Russell Westbrook has 23 points. Anthony Davis has 17 points and 8 rebounds. The Lakers have 12 minutes to improbably save their season.@Suns @DevinBook Lakeshow 17 banners suns 0

Lol😄@RkyMtnSunDevil @Suns Me, pick me!The Suns lead the Lakers 98-80 at the end of the 3rd quarter, with a Phoenix win eliminating LA from playoff contention!

#ValleyProudFinish this off homies @SunsThe Suns won 19 games only three years ago. Not enough people are talking about how historic this rapid turnaround is in Phoenix.

From laughingstock to juggernaut with a few calculated moves. Incredible.@Suns @DevinBook He definitely meets the criteriaWatching the @Lakers vs @Suns and I have to give some mad respect to the @Suns they have some amazing team chemistry and play amazingly great together, they are killing the @Lakers by 24 points the last time I checked, we aren’t making the playoffs this year unless a miracle coms https://t.co/W3RC12QxYQ@Suns @DevinBook here comes the no lebron repliesBucks have 49 wins….

Nothing good we should remember Frank Vogel for in LAEveryone watching Phoenix Suns Basketball https://t.co/XcWFBKXVH9Phoenix should just say that this was good practice for the playoffs, this is essentially a shoot around for them.

Must be a joke.@Abnormal_00 @LakersNation @Suns But the suns have only 1 player with a all-star start, and it’s been years since he’s done it yall still got too 7 player AD??@ProvideIQ_ @Suns Hard to call this struggling lmao. 19 free throws in the first half was the only reason it was close.@CP3 -&gt; @mikal_bridges

Oh this game is gonna be fun!Good luck tonight @Suns@Suns @campayne @mikal_bridges Show a little mercy? Lol@Jumpshot8 @thisisjadej @Suns You're welcome EJ. You know what for.If the @Suns wanted to make it extremely difficult for fans to watch their games, they made a great decision in partnering with @BALLYSPORTSAZ . Why does their app suck and why can't you pay for a stand alone subscription?!?!?With San Antonio leading comfortably in Denver, the Lakers MUST beat the Suns in Phoenix tonight to stay alive in the Play-In picture. 

Or else, the Lake Show is over.Let’s go @Suns!! #ValleyProud #BeatLAALERT: New high roller bet posted!

https://t.co/XkrgWfu1PaU gotta be kidding me. The Lakers are really about to play the @Suns as the last game of the night. if the Suns dont beat them by 50. they might not win a championship. ijs@Jumpshot8 @thisisjadej @Suns Nice, congrats EJ!!!! I won't be at the game but hopefully I can find a stream to see it!Y'all really shouldn't pay Ayton this summer @Sunsi wish i was in phoenix, real tough sell for me to stay up this late for the suns@ThatEricAlper I met Mario Lopez at a Suns game in Phoenix.  He amiably chatted about Saved By the Bell and the game with all of us around him.  Total lack of pretentiousness or anything.  Just a regular guy.LFG @Suns Let’s close these burnouts out tonight. When we do, tomorrow at all @Burritoexp locations make your burrito a combo for 63cents. Just show this to the team member at the register. Beans, Rice and a drink for a lil change! Let’s break the record homies. #supportlocalEverything else about LeBron James in LA has been awful. 

Anthony Davis’ best ability is being unavailable. Westbrook trade was terrible. 

Poor management, from the top down. Zero team chemistry. All season. 

Congrats @Suns on the franchise best record and NBA’s best record!@NBA2K @Suns @celtics @MiamiHEAT @warriors announce luka 99@Suns good.

Fitting that the @Suns will set a franchise record in the process. 

This Lakers team has been a complete failure at all levels. 

If LeBron cared, he would be playing tonight. He quit. They quit. Frank Vogel is toast. 

Congrats on the bubble title.@nbaunitracker @Suns Suns suck at keeping shit a secret eh?Anyways no mercy tonight k? @spurs @Suns@CaseyShuman @Suns Lol if suns lose just basically proves ad points that not meaningless lolThis Lakers season was like watching a dying dog in it's last few months. There would be occasional happy moments, but it was mostly tragic &amp; you were just waiting for it to end.

Tonight is the final trip to the vets, and the Phoenix Suns are the euthanasia.Not sure there has ever been a bigger, meaningless game for the @Suns lol.. #beatLAAnd now watch closely as the @Suns make the @Lakers chance at the playoffs DISAPPEAR https://t.co/jQHIUz6Ts4ALERT: New high roller bet posted!
