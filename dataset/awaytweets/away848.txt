Utah's defense yields 35 points to Orlando in 3Q, including the last four on the taunting tech and a blown rotation that led to a Wagner 3. Still flirting with disaster. 21p for Don (on 5-18 FGs, 9-10 FTs).After three, the @utahjazz lead the @orlandomagic 77-74. 

Donovan Mitchell has 21 points, but the Jazz need someone else to step up and help him.

Poor Orlando. https://t.co/pJd9TgwPzx@DanteMagic @OrlandoMagic It is and always will be weird. My first time doing so was 2yrs ago today. Enjoy it with your favorite drink and enjoy the family time.End of 1Q: Jazz 28, Magic 12. 

Orlando has just has many turnovers (5) as made shots (5 of 21). 

Utah's turned the ball over 6 times. Jazz, led by Mitchell‚Äôs 11, are shooting 43.5% (10 of 23).End 1Q: Jazz 28, Magic 12. Orlando shoots 5-21 overall, 2-10 from 3, 0-2 FTs, also committed 5 turnovers. Honestly, it's only this close because the Jazz committed 6 turnovers and only shot 2-12 from 3. Donovan Mitchell 11p.Impressive quarter from the @utahjazz, fueled by 11 points from Donovan Mitchell and stellar defense. 

Jazz lead the @OrlandoMagic 28-12 after one. 

#TakeNote 

https://t.co/Hc8LBiZzFgEnd of 1: Utah 28, Orlando 12.

Mitchell with 11 points and 3 rebounds, Whiteside and Dok combine for 10 points and 10 rebounds. Jazz missed a lot of open shots (17% from 3) and still lead by 16.

 The Magic are really bad.The Orlando Magic only scored 12 points in the first quarter. Twelve.They've gotten some help from a very bad Magic offense, but the Jazz's defensive level remains high. Really seems like the group has collectively locked in. And again, basing that on more than tonight, where a lot of defenses would look good.

Are Celtics/Nuggets gonna get our over to keep the sweep alive???@OrlandoMagic You guys are the worst team so far..  pukes ü§Æü§Æ@OrlandoMagic Y‚Äôall want to sign me to a 10 day contract? Pretty sure I can play better than most of the roster@Jkdathird I know an Orlando Magic hat when I see one though üòÇ@DanteMagic @OrlandoMagic Alcohol and patience@DanteMagic @OrlandoMagic Cold beer and munchies, specially on a Friday night. Ensure the family is okay with some screams from time to time‚Ä¶ particularly when Franz decides to drop the German hammer or Human Torch shows up. üòÅ@OrlandoMagic so patheticWith 4:47 left in the first quarter the @utahjazz lead the @OrlandoMagic 18-7. 

A lot of deflections making life difficult for the Orlando offense.
