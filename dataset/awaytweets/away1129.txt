https://t.co/bmdsONosT5@0rf Now seems like a good time to talk about Wisconsin Lt Gov Mandela Barnes assaulting a reporter for asking him why he voted to give hundreds of millions of taxpayer dollars to the new Milwaukee Bucks arena. Barnes was a state legislator then. (continued)

The Milwaukee Bucks will be fully healthy for this game Tuesday night.  It has been rare for them to have Giannis, Holiday and Middleton in the lineup at the same time this season, but when they have had all 3 they have been dominant.@UGSHavard I'm curious because I might be in the two areas (Milwaukee and Chicago) and wanted to know if there were scenes to visit.
