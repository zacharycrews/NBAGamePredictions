One of the Heat's most recent victories, aside from winning against the Wizards, was against the Pelicans 113-98 at home.@Heat4life01 I can confirm @Heat4life01 it's a fan of the Miami Heat.😂@WashWizards @CapitalOne The Wizards lost their most recent game to the Miami Heat 97-112 in the first game of a double round against the Heat on the road. But before that loss the Wizards also lost to the Hornets 87-97 on the road, that loss was the end of a five-gsme winning streak for the Wizards.@DwyaneWade @MiamiHEAT I hated the Heat till you went there, now they are my ride or die, and it’s because of you not many people believe but I predicted the trio six months before it happened. I’m your biggest PNW fan I tried to see you in Portland your last season but it was so hard getting tickets.@WashWizards Game at 7:00pm vs @MiamiHEAT!
My 3 Predictions:
-Bradley Beal will score 30+ points and have 7+ assists
-Spencer Dinwiddie will score 20+ points
-Kyle Kuzma will make 4+ 3 pointers and have 10+ rebounds
(The Wizards Will Win 124-118!)

My Picks are:

Miami Heat @ Washington Wizards
Charlotte Hornets @ Atlanta Hawks
Memphis Grizzlies @ Minnesota TimberwolvesI can't wait for this @MiamiHEAT vs @WashWizards game tonight.Michigan State’s marquee noncon is a Miami team that will fire their head coach here soon. Michigan’s is a Washington team that already did fire their head coach.

Nah we need to fix that tomorrow @MiamiHEATThis current Lakers team IMO has (*kinda) the same vibes as the 2010-11 Miami Heat. For context: 

Through 17 games: 

'11 Heat: 9-8 record 
'21 Lakers: 8-9 record

After 17 games: 
'11 Heat: Won 12 straight games
'21 Lakers: ??? https://t.co/UrZTmYxEfB@KendrickPerkins Lebron ain’t saving these boys. They need Miami Heat Bron.

19 points scored off 8 for 11 shooting 
3 for 4 = 75% for 3-pointers. New teammates wouldn’t understand.@ShandaRoberts76 @MiamiHEAT Look here Dr. Im still waiting for you to drop the mic, throw the U then go go stage left.
