Chavis, Jr at Phoenix Suns- Denver Nuggets NBA Game - Do you know about his life story and accomplishments? Read more about them here: https://t.co/RL6GavCdk0Phoenix Suns Players Pay It Forward At Local Food Drive https://t.co/kBMnEgc9p0@thrillathechase @Suns This SEGABABA at Spurs is so annoying to me. Not only is it a SEGABABA which I think should be abolished, they have to fly two hours and lose an hour on the time change.

#abolishbacktobacks@PHNX_Suns Kinda funny they won’t pay him the max when literally every other team in the nba would. @suns need to wake upNext 6 @Suns games

4 game road trip:

At the Spurs (segababa)
At the Cavs
At the Knicks
At the Nets (segababa)

Back to the Foot:

Warriors at home
Pistons at home

6-0 would break a franchise record 17 game win streak. 

How will the Suns do?@CoryMelvin4 @Suns @DeandreAyton Great painting👍🏿 Ignore the hate. It’s brilliant.🏀 #NBA

Cam Johnson and the @Suns lead it at the break on NBA League Pass... Second half action from Phoenix soon: https://t.co/v6K0bTigd9 https://t.co/PKL3zYNSLx #NBA@DrNiravPandya Based on info I’ve read, e.g., Anthony Slater, it sounds as if Kerr wants Klay to play his first game back at home/ Chase Ctr. That points toward possibly Mon. 12/20 (Kings) or 12/23 (Grizzlies), ahead of the Christmas Day game w/ Suns in Phoenix. https://t.co/OQnQpwxqmXPhoenix Suns vs. San Antonio Spurs - 11/22/2021 Free Pick &amp; NBA Betting Prediction https://t.co/stQgeSot0O

Cameron Payne just hit a triple. All nine players that have checked in for the Suns so far have now scored.

Phoenix leads 55-35.According to the Suns, that was Phoenix's second-highest scoring first quarter in franchise history, trailing only they 50 points they put up back in 1990...also against DenverThe Denver Nuggets allow 48 points in the first quarter to the Suns, the 14th time in team history giving up that many points in any quarter. This is just the 3rd time the Nuggets have allowed that many since the start of the 1991-92 season.

Phoenix shot 77% FG and 88% 3pt-FG.The Phoenix suns are getting it done on both ends of the floor this season, they're playing really good basketball at the moment.JaVale McGee hammers it home as Phoenix scores 48 PTS in Q1 👀
