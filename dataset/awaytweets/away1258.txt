I have a suggestion about the hamstring. I used to suffer recurring hamstring injuries in the past, but after I started applying heat regularly to that area, the injuries healed, and did not reoccur anymore.

Let me know. I have the Phoenix Suns.@ESPNNBA the people that don’t understand this quote lack critical thinking skills. the suns will have a different play style NOP may not be ready for with their star being out, and phoenix will likely be playing more aggressive and with more energy to offset the injury. makes sense.@mccall_andy @ilwtawto @dallasmavs @Chime Great, cool.

What I don’t like tho is that the @Suns had like a whole weeks worth of rest before the playoffs, they shouldn’t be that bad lol.Just hoping our Wings and Payne show up. Ayton has to dominate in the paint. No more finesse, he’s got to be physical with Val@Kyle_Odegard Injuries are no excuse.

Rents are increasing across the country at a breakneck pace, making it more difficult for renters to find affordable housing. https://t.co/1OQz2kPxmw https://t.co/S0b2LE4f2O@QPitt33 KDs open to movement but if your coach doesn't design any of it that iso ball is what you get. They run that Phoenix Suns pick and roll offense and if that doesn't work go 1v1. It's lazy and God awful. If they change the coach alone this team is 20 wins betterZITI Sports

He dropped 31 in the 1st half &amp; they were still losing by 3pts when he got injured. CP3 was on god mode in game 1 &amp; it was still tight af. Maybe the Pelicans are good or Phoenix is overrated.

Phoenix Suns guard Devin Booker is out indefinitely after suffering a right hamstring injury in Game 2 of the Phoenix’s first-round series with the New Orleans Pelicans, the team announced today. 

#NBAPlayoffs2022 https://t.co/b9P6XqVcbI@sunspot467 @Suns @DevinBook I like to a women's t shirt, Suns!!!@Suns Let's get back on top guys!@Suns You got this! Keep your head in the game! 🧡💜I really don't see the Phoenix Suns making it to the finals without their all-star player in Devin Booker@AndrewLeezus True! I don't know how tomorrow's game is gonna end, but Chris, Cam and crew are gonna run that court like their shoes are on fire!! Will be awesome to see!Can't wait. @CP3 @cam23suns @SunsAt this point it looks like the West will go down to Golden State and Phoenix. I don’t see Memphis beating GS. As long as Booker comes back then the Suns should be good to go. Dallas is a threat but I don’t think they’re there yet. The East is a tossup.Booker is out 2 or 3 weeks! When you lose a all-star caliber player in Devin Booker. I hate to say it but the Phoenix Suns hopes and dreams of bringing the Larry O'Brien trophy to the city of Phoenix might very well be fading into the sunset 🌇I think the final will be between 

Phoenix Suns and Gold State Warriors 🤔@Less_HumbleTeej If Phoenix gets Booker back, they can't beat the Suns.I have a play for tomorrow… 🫢

• Phoenix Suns -1.5 (-110) 2u

These odds are too good to pass up. Phoenix is DEEP &amp; should play well through adversity. They’ve shown they can do it all year. 

BOL if you tail or fade!! 🍀🍀🍀

You would think after what happened in Game 2 that the Jazz would be smart enough to start guarding the 3-point line. I guess not.Want to make it clear I have been a dedicated phoenix suns fan my entire life since last year@Daimon816 @Suns HahahaSaving for later.
