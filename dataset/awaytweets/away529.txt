#BullsNation@chicagobulls @SamSmithHoops Bulls tried working out a deal to bring Rose back, instead landed Caruso at 4yr/36m.

We lost Thad to the Spurs but in exchange for DeMar.

Lauri we gained DJJ + 1st rd pick that allowed us money to give Lonzo Ball a 4yr 80m deal.

Hating ain’t healthy bruh https://t.co/bKD2Qbv9ew@jojocasualbull @Leo39451585 @chicagobulls @McclungMac It’s possible, but not likely. KK was a lethal 3 point shooter, and was 6’7”. If MM can develop a more facilitator role like JJ Barea or defensively like TJ McConnell then he stands a chance, but as is I don’t think he holds much value. It’s a shame because he’s a great athlete.@kobeeeeeeeee999 @Joshiebanks @Drew7Rein @chicagobulls @calamos 1.) there’s no “we” coming from that hating ass angle 🤨
2.) We weren’t at full strength for EITHER of those games where we beat them (that’s 2-0, sir)

I’ve always said, players who come to Chicago (after the Jordan era) will have some big shoes to fill and an opportunity to solidify themselves in Bulls history as one of the greats.

He’s literally a walking flame thrower, and could drop 30 every game with 10 assists.@cettobin @AIxAnalyst @BleacherReport @chicagobulls He isn’t an equal playmaker.

Let's not pretend that franchise is on the level of the Lakers, Celtics or even the Bulls or Spurs. The Bucks did dick for about 30 years. I would just enjoy the ride. People aren't going to flock to that city when Giannis is gone.- Chicago are allowing 23.5 pts avg, ranking 29th agst PFs in the league. 
- All of Wizards starting Frontcourt is injured or in protocols exept Kuzma and Gafford 
- Kuzma has had over 19pts in 3/4 last games 

Can we trust Kuzma with Over 16pts against Bulls ? 😏💰

Love you. - Keith@chicagobulls Thanks guys !! #BullsNation@BlackSwanzS @chicagobulls I kind of figured that would be the case.

Solution might be to trade away Coby White for either a low first round pick (a good team) or maybe a backup PF for depth.

With a full roster, I think Bradley, Jones Jr, Brown Jr., and Coby could be in danger for any minutes at all.@ctsbulls @DeMar_DeRozan @chicagobulls This is exactly why people think white people can’t dance@FirleNathan @chicagobulls Yeah, I was just thinking the same. Maybe they could recoup a low 1st round pick (if lucky) for Coby since playing time will be an issue with a full healthy lineup.

They held out for one when they traded away Markkanen, maybe they will do the same with Coby.@levi_ballard21 @chicagobulls @DeMar_DeRozan Best final 💕☺️♥️👀🖤@chicagobulls @DeMar_DeRozan Thank you DeMar ⚡️🏀⚡️@Crazedrat1 @chicagobulls I believe Coby wouldn’t be played over Ayo and honestly might be traded@chicagobulls @DeMar_DeRozan Here comes the BULLS!!!@cam17giam @chicagobulls agreed, on order and everything@schutzemdown @chicagobulls OPA is derived by adjusting offensive box +/- (OBPM) to account for the number of possessions the player is present for. Similarly, DPS is derived from a similar adjustment of defensive box +/- (DBPM) with that same number of possessions.@chicagobulls COBY IS A BALLER!!!@schutzemdown @chicagobulls The concept of total points added (TPA), isn’t complicated. We’re looking at both defensive &amp; offensive effectiveness on a per-possession basis while also incorporating the amount of playing time the contributor receives.@mes34 Two things 1) ur tweet was co-signed by @TheKingDream 2) I was actually disappointed when @chicagobulls put @CobyWhite on the shelve.
