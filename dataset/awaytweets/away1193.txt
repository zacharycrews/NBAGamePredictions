#NBA #bet #dataanalyst #cryptocurrencyNew post (Oklahoma City Thunder vs. Utah Jazz Pick - NBA April 6, 2022) has been published on The Sports Geek - https://t.co/2GC3eoJKDf https://t.co/P9P0vDqRZGThe Oklahoma City Thunder announced on Wednesday that it has signed Melvin Frazier Jr. to a two-way spot on the roster. To make room, Olivier Sarr was released.  https://t.co/ifTwruXtJRJersey Watch: 

Melvin Frazier Jr. could become the third No. 35 in Oklahoma City Thunder history.

Frazier Jr. has worn No. 35 since his college days at Tulane.

The 25-year-old would join Kevin Durant and P.J. Dozier as other players to don No. 35, if worn out.

https://t.co/hFWExjx20LFor Oklahoma City #Thunder fans looking to learn more on recent two-way signee Melvin Frazier Jr. I highly suggest giving this article a read:

Frazier Jr. is a very intriguing pickup, he’s been on the Thunder’s radar for years.

https://t.co/DWbbKiwbObMelvin Frazier Jr. has been on the Oklahoma City Thunder’s radar since 2020.

Frazier Jr. played the last two seasons with the Blue before being traded to the Iowa Wolves mid-season.
