 Miami and the Magic should be the game of the night. Miami has the endurance of a winner. Losing big stars usually sinks teams. Bam Adebayo and Jimmy Butler are driving the Heat to the top. NBA is also winning.

#NBA2K22 on PC https://t.co/mBP6ho6s8y@GhostFaceDrizzy @Troutprophet The heat are one of the outliers though. Thats why Ball dont stop take is a flawed. Like you said Heat offense is not spaced out they rely on midrange , hand offs &amp; back door screens /cuts. They grind you out. Grizzlies are run/gun but in the halfcourt theyre like miami.@tessier_mf @dystopiabreaker Come to Miami (before the heat death)White hot is back in @MiamiHEAT.
