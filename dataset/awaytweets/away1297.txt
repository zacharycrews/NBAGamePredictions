Here’s why:
Win tonight, going back to Milwaukee up 3-2 and have two tries for 1 win.  If they win the series, they’ll absolutely be favored to beat Miami. https://t.co/WFsZ5HWxSt@CalvinBucks34 @Bucks GL tonight manBig Play! 🔥🔥

A very close game with @JuliusErving and his 32 points on .750 shooting. 8-8 at the line. https://t.co/MflzmRwabt@IKE_Bucks @Bucks yes jevon can take the ball up when he’s on the court and make a move, but he’ll pass it unless he’s open. and hill creates plays and isn’t scared to shoot, but allen and bobby who haven’t been taking as many shots like the first series are my biggest takeaway,  #BucksIn6hey @bucks…I know it’s a big game tonight.

https://t.co/HSUwwyySILMaybe most troubling stat entering G5 for #Bucks. Continuing a trend from R1, they've been the worst half court offense of the 8 teams in R2 by far. Maybe #Celtics clench their teeth that it's 2-2 in spite of that, but if BOS isnt feeding Milwaukee's fast break, Bucks can't score https://t.co/Qh1sLKV6J2@Im_X1 @Bucks @Giannis_An34 Believe me, I'm fighting for those rights to women's health care and autonomy.

The Sacramento Kings will renounce Donte DiVincenzo making him an unrestricted free agent. It is believed DiVincenzo will sign a multi year contract with his old team the Milwaukee Bucks. Boston and Cleveland is also in play for DiVincenzo.It is my preference that the NBA Champion Milwaukee Bucks win today.

This is the Way.

Man up!  Hill is an absolute liability with absolutely no positives right now. Bucks will lose if they play him! Simples.The #NBA is truly a global sport!

Excited to see the @Bucks tapped for international games. Makes more sense to keep it to the pre-season so teams get the right amount of rest. But exciting to see the #Bucks profile expand. Thank you @Giannis_An34!

Deepest condolences to the Lanier family 🙏🏾This meme is especially hilarious because Giannis is shooting 43% fresh off of shooting 57% against Chicago
And Milwaukee, the 3rd highest scoring offense in the NBA this season, is averaging 99ppg on 42% shooting.

Lanier was great as a Bonnie

a great with the Detroit Pistons and
Milwaukee Bucks. And he was a truly great ambassador for the sport as a real class act .

I like Jevon and think hes better than Hill, but when you’re 6’1 &amp; the other option is 6’4 w/ a 6’9 reach you won’t be as effective on switches.@alexengel12 Admirals barely pull 750 a night. Especially with Bucks recent success, nobody going to hockey games in Milwaukee. NHL, or otherwise.@tmj4 @Bucks After tonight, people will say “what a dumb corgi”.@Bucks Good luck yall@MilwaukeeMeeks @IKE_Bucks @Bucks He won a championship and has a lot of playoff experience.  He’s still a good defender.  It’s like when Bud didn’t play Portis the last 3 games against the Nets last year. It makes no sense.Congratulations to TSALEX (@ahunt940) who moved up 2 spots to take #2 on the Milwaukee Bucks team leaderboard.

Hill is 3 inches taller than Jevon and has a reach that is 5 inches longer.

I like Jevon more and think he’s a better defender against their position, but Hill is more versatile as his size allows him to be less of a mismatch on switches@ESPNNBA @Bucks my boy completely embarrassed himself last game.

I’m beyond proud of these guys, and I CAN’T wait to see this film! @Giannis_An34 @Kostas_ante13 @alex_ante34 @Thanasis_ante43 @Bucks https://t.co/1ZYaXyoDrj@CarriedLeBron @Bucks Ratio@Bucks no we don’tThe city loves you, Giannis. 💚 https://t.co/HWoFD9JWWo@Bucks Announce Khris Middleton out until monday@PHLSixersNation the sixers would get smoked by the celtics or bucks anyways. if they can’t play in miami they certainly won’t be able to play in boston or milwaukee@LegionHoops @latimes You can pay a hundred bucks for a 6-pack of Old Milwaukee, but it’s still Old Milwaukee. #BucksIn6@adamjraabe @MKEMarionW @GordonHintz Kohl turned down higher cash offers in order to secure a commitment for the team to remain in Milwaukee. It was the NBA league office that said the Bucks needed a new arena to stay in town.I believe @Bucks vs @celtics is the most competitive match of the play offs.Absolutely! @Bucks in 6! https://t.co/wQtPxMKKv9@STXRBOY999 Greenbay Packers, Milwaukee Bucks, Milwaukee Brewers!How important was Derrick White to the Boston Celtics’ Game 4 win over the Milwaukee Bucks? https://t.co/ljQ4nFNgsu@stocktalkweekly @STXRBOY999 The Milwaukee Bucks baby!@Bucks We actually need a dub dub to finish this series…@Bucks Give Bobby more minutesThe Milwaukee Bucks have their backs against a wall again.

Don’t bet against the Bucks@DanRShafer @MKEMarionW @GordonHintz The Bucks were already here and when Kohl sold the team reports indicated that there were, at a minimun, vague promises to keep the team in Milwaukee.Who will win the @NBA championship?  @warriors @Suns @Bucks @celtics #WarriorsVsGrizzlies #BucksVSCeltics #NBAPlayoffs #NBAonTNT #NBATwitterLiveGood listen. Just brutal to take in as a fan of the Milwaukee bucks however. 

Basically in a concise interpretation - - 

The bucks are hell bent on making offensive basketball as difficult as possible for their 2 primary shot creators. (TACTICALLY) https://t.co/BcpM4kYm3y@Bucks I'll make a prediction that Khris is going to play next game and they'll let us know a couple hours before the game .@TheBlackHyena1 @Bucks @paysbig This was the best assessment of last night. A 35 year old guy outplayed everyone on both benches. Might as well have put 43 on him till he was exhausted. Then just went next man down till he could not run anymore. One of the ugliest games I have seen in recent memory.@Bucks both teams could be up 3 to 1 so just go get it done we know you we need more from  everyone  you win you can end it at home lets play like itThey should do some kind of social deep-dive on the Boston/Milwaukee fans’ behavior during this series.

Both sides are losing their minds and assuming the victim position. MIL couldn’t take it if they lost to BOSTON and BOS couldn’t take it if they lost to a Middleton-less Bucks🇦🇪🏀The @NBA is going to the United Arab Emirates for the first time! 

The @ATLHawks and @Bucks will play two October preseason games in Abu Dhabi.

It will be the #NBA debut in the Arabian Gulf!

#NBAinAbuDhabi https://t.co/hd8r3bmLO1@BedalPaul @MarcoMasotti_ @Bucks @SharksRugby What’s @QuadeCooper up to these days?@CelticssUp @dwhite4451 @Bucks well some could say  boston should be up 3 to 1 but in game 3 jason could not shoot lol@mpeters102 @nathanmarzion @Bucks @celtics Dirty 🤣🤣😂🤣😂Giannis took out Kyrie and tried to take out Booker. And has hit Brown, Tatum, and Horford mid air. Plus is throwing elbows around. The Bucks the dirtiest team in the NBA.Who gonna win? @NBA #NBAPlayoffs2022

@celtics or @BucksAlmost 10 years ago my now wife took me to a Lakers game vs the @Bucks ... I remember leaving the game and telling my homies about this greek kid who had some raw skill... awesome to see what @Giannis_An34 has become and is becoming! https://t.co/kAn0yb2YzJ@IKE_Bucks @Khris22m @Bucks Yes. Absolutely yes. Bring him off the bench and let him run pick n roll with Giannis.Milwaukee Bucks: Bucks hit the road to try to take series lead over Al Horford, Celtics https://t.co/hNkxbcwuJXWhere does the buck stop? Milwaukee?@tomandannfarris @IKE_Bucks @Khris22m @Bucks That’s fair. And I do wonder about the Olympics. Playing basically year round is really insane and that’s what happens for guys who play in the finals and through the gold medal game. Very little time off.@Bucks Hopefully the plane takes off without HillI need a W tomorrow @Bucks !!@Bucks where homosexuality is punishable by death.  Kind of left that part out.  Remember you couldn't play games because of injustice in this country.  SMH@PHXazfan @NBA @celtics @warriors @Bucks @dallasmavs @Giannis_An34 @luka7doncic @MiamiHEAT @Suns @sixers @memgrizz I live in Philly n I know they ain’t getting past Boston or bucks so does everyone else here. Memphis w/o ja is cooked@Bucks Don’t come back w/o the 3-2 lead.@Bucks Win. Just win.@Bucks WARCRY! BUCKS IN SIX!!! 💚🦌💚🦌💚@Bucks If Khris can stand, he can play. I don’t make the rules.@DamnJaq Do you think teams that are middle of the pack will relocate, since that was the original topic? Are the Bucks in danger of leaving Milwaukee?@IKE_Bucks @Khris22m @Bucks If he's able to play both ends he needs to be on the court@Bucks Giannis is a trashy player since he won. Respect levels for the Giannis the Basketball Player: 📉@_JasonLT Al Horford made 5 ——3-pointers off 7 attempts, GAME-CHANGER nobody expected from the Boston Celtics Center position. 👎
Only reason Milwaukee Bucks lost.Bucks in 6
#FearTheDeer 
@Bucks 🏀@taMsMRHYKEn6VvD @Bucks I absolutely think so .@TSpeth5 @TCIIIESQ If you think I’m attempting to sit here and dissect whether or not the Milwaukee Bucks players have actual egos then you’re the strictest definition of delusion. 

We don’t deal with egos or drama here. By the way show me where I said “I don’t think any NBA players have egos”.Bucks are 40pts better per 100 with Giannis on the court but only winning by 2pts per 100 when he plays. Celtics annihilating Milwaukee every time he sits.@yogaze_ @Bucks Horford  got the last laugh in game 4.  He dialed in, scored 30 and Cs got the W.@dwhite4451 @Bucks They were smiling and joking in game 1 , it should be 3-1 rn lil bro see you tomorrow lmao…@Bucks Take a picture of the clapper@kyoo @bucks @BucksLead a Celtics staffer is calling Giannis “Lymphoma”?  Really?@CelticssUp @Bucks Remember last time they smiled after a playoff loss?Green Bay Packers in London… or Milwaukee Bucks in Abu Dhabi.  🤔🤔🤔@Bucks tell jrue to step up@Bucks Why y’all smiling tho@Bucks Come on boys, let’s get this game 5 dub..@Bucks Them deadIn Photos: Bucks travel to Boston ahead of Game 5.@IKE_Bucks @Khris22m @Bucks The way they are are shooting the ball in this series, hell yes.@HaakonMusic @JasonBo41712268 @Bron6ix @BGN_5 Loll you're talking about Giannis Shooting 30% from3??72%From FT?

Ooh maybe i was checking the wrong season, didn't Philly and bucks won 51 games both?? Ohh what about the game Embiid won in Milwaukee with 42/14/5 on 67% without his 2nd best player 2months ago? Get some sleep.@itsforress @IKE_Bucks @Khris22m @Bucks Oh I know he’s great and I’m a fan.  Guess that was a bit harsh.  But this year has been a struggle for him though; We need him but he needs to be healthy and The Middleton from 2021 playoffs, not 2022.  Saw a lot of bad plays from him this year, way more than last year.@Bucks Is Khris even wearing a brace on his knee? https://t.co/TRFbQBoxvt@AlexLasryWI @Bucks None of that money is yours, it comes from Wall Street donors and your billionaire family@IKE_Bucks @Khris22m @Bucks If they take game 5 then what is there to lose by playing him in a do or die game 6?
