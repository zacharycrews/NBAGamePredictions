#NBA #BettingTwitter https://t.co/0Z6sfQTrsV@TaylorSchultze @SacramentoKings And the number 2 pick goes to the Spurs, which means the Sacramento Kings will have the number 1 pick in the 2022 NBA draft!YESSIR!! Here's what I would suggest: 

Since both Seattle &amp; Las Vegas belong on the West Coast, I think it's appropriate that they get to replace 2 West teams: 

Sacramento Kings ‚û°Ô∏è Seattle #BringBackTheSonics
New Orleans Pelicans ‚û°Ô∏è Las Vegas

You cant even make a fair point with an easy go-to stat website. Not hard to do some math to know that this is not an accurate representationThe @SacramentoKings are the @Lions of the NBA@DylanFrew6 @OTownNBA @DomasSaburner @EthanWheatthin2 @statmuse @SacramentoKings also how you a colts fan but not a pacers fan? at least root for a state team lol. It would make sense why a pacers or kings fan would be showing us the win rates.@DylanFrew6 @DomasSaburner @EthanWheatthin2 @statmuse @SacramentoKings so like everyone's expectations. The kings were still ass. You did not have to show us the win rate like we cant tell  for ourselves how bad the kings are@DylanFrew6 @DomasSaburner @EthanWheatthin2 @statmuse @SacramentoKings no difference makers added with Sabonis and now they're both getting screwed for it.  

everyone laughed at the kings cause they got one thing and nothing else for what they gave up. We all knew Sabonis was not gonna make a difference with this badly managed team.@DylanFrew6 @DomasSaburner @EthanWheatthin2 @statmuse @SacramentoKings that never was said. No one thought burton would be better than Sabonis. Sabonis itself was not a bad pick. But they added nothing to it@Trip53820192 @SacramentoKings @swipathefox @hbarnes @Dsabonis11 yep, Holiday and Lyles went missing@DylanFrew6 @OTownNBA @DomasSaburner @EthanWheatthin2 @statmuse @SacramentoKings Just hope that your magic gets at least 20 wins next season.@MarcosBreton @SacramentoKings It really is tough to see.@DylanFrew6 @OTownNBA @DomasSaburner @EthanWheatthin2 @statmuse @SacramentoKings ahh yes. With your weak team getting Injured all the time. Your gonna be in hell for the next couple of years. man your team is tanking so you gotta take your rage out on better teams. I understand that lol@DylanFrew6 @DomasSaburner @EthanWheatthin2 @statmuse @SacramentoKings It was not a bad pick. Never said he was a good defender but he brought a lot into the team. But the defense entirely is so bad. Even if you got Draymond green or Murray or Marcus smart. the defense would not change at all.@MarcosBreton @SacramentoKings Been asking myself the same question. It hurts me to see it in writing üò≠@DylanFrew6 @DomasSaburner @EthanWheatthin2 @statmuse @SacramentoKings which it clearly did not. With no help really outside of fox. They're still losing games. At least they could have gone for a good defender. You've been acting like Sabonis is the reason why they still suck. Go watch the magic tank.@MarcosBreton @SacramentoKings Hard to watch. Hard to give them $$$.
Even the new interest that came with the trade only lasted about 3 games.@Pickswise The Sacramento Kings@DylanFrew6 @OTownNBA @DomasSaburner @EthanWheatthin2 @statmuse @SacramentoKings ok yea sure. Just get better next season@DylanFrew6 @DomasSaburner @EthanWheatthin2 @statmuse @SacramentoKings It's just that when they traded away shield and burton for Sabonis and a bunch of nobodies. People were concerned and thought with just one contributing player, would not make a difference to the team@DylanFrew6 @DomasSaburner @EthanWheatthin2 @statmuse @SacramentoKings If you watched any basketball then you would know Sabonis was a good pick. It's just the rest of the team is not so efficient. No Defense at all. (top 5 in points given up)@_bnice11 Sacramento or LA Kings hockey?@MarcosBreton @SacramentoKings Yes. When they finally figure out that not everything can be solved by a new face in a Kings jersey. Dig a little deeper and work on the foundation, coaches, owners, et al. 

And when you do, you just might regret trading away Haliburton.@DylanFrew6 @OTownNBA @DomasSaburner @EthanWheatthin2 @statmuse @SacramentoKings so how does other teams who have had a lot of Injuries do much better?@MarcosBreton @SacramentoKings Even if the Kings somehow made it to the play-in they would still be a sucky team, and they'll only aim for that bare minimum forever since there's a reward for it. At the same time, they won't even break 30 wins this season so...we deserve so much better than this garbage.@DylanFrew6 @DomasSaburner @EthanWheatthin2 @statmuse @SacramentoKings Magic fans don't get no say lol. You have also been going at Sabonis for like two weeks.

https://t.co/cUSxnYdNUiFirst order of business for the Sacramento Kings:  Stop letting the other team score so many points.@SacramentoKings @swipathefox @hbarnes @Dsabonis11 Barnes scored 6 points in the 2nd half Sabonis scored 5 points in the 2nd half.

It will honestly probably be up there with Steph Curry's 3-pointers made record being untouchable in the annals of history.@SacramentoKings @swipathefox @hbarnes @Dsabonis11 Some kings fans said to me when they beat us early this season without BI that they are better than us and will finish higher, let's all laugh@SacramentoKings @swipathefox @hbarnes @Dsabonis11 GET SORRY ASS ALVIN OUTTA HERE https://t.co/x8WGbiTCEgPELICANS WIN!

https://t.co/IIuYCTQkL5Will there ever be a time when the @SacramentoKings don‚Äôt suck?1. Nail in the coffin? The Kings have tried to keep their play-in hopes alive, but a loss against the Pelicans all but ended that on Wednesday night. Sacramento now trails the Pelicans by 4 games in the standings and 5 games in the loss column with 18 games remaining.@SacramentoKings team/organization is so terrible that even they have been working from home during the whole pandemic! @NBA @nbatopshot @topshot_updates https://t.co/5ReOdWXYYHThe loss by the Sacramento Kings tonight extends an amazing streak:

Winning seasons in Sacramento with Rick Adelman as coach: 8 in 8 years

Winning seasons in Sacramento with anyone else as coach: 0 in 29 yearsI can deal with missed 3‚Äôs, but not getting back on D is inexcusable for professionals. @SacramentoKingsPray for me; nothing wrong. I'm just a Sacramento Kings die-hard fanNow you bring Metu in, Gentry I had hope for you OG.

Disgusted right now three of 24 are you kidding meWow y‚Äôall came here for nothing @SacramentoKings@SagED_UP One of mine is the @SacramentoKings so i can without a doubt tell you who's the furthest away :-)What hurts the WORST about the @SacramentoKings is they traded a future star in my opinion in Hali, and what for? To continue to play like the Kings, seriously, they should have just let NBA relocate them, we're looking at 20 years and they show no signs of ever wanting to win.GET OFF OUR DAMN COURT @SacramentoKings@kangs530 @SacramentoKings Not true cause if the refs physically suited up for a game vs @SacramentoKings they would still lose.@damienbarling @SacramentoKings @wizkhalifa @DLoAndKC @ESPN1320 @IamKDiddy That‚Äôs right.
