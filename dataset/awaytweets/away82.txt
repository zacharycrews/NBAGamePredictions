@BiscayneBayBrewThx 2 Bill Herenda, Spencer Mayfield, Larry Lawrence and all the NBA/Utah Jazz fans, 4 their kind words about our tweets. Sharing and Caring!@HPbasketball One thing I really dislike about NBA 'takes', is how the regular season is de-emphasized.  It is AWESOME that the Utah Jazz are such an incredible regular season team.  It should be celebrated!  Focus on post-season ignores the daily awesomeness of both teams and players.@5ivves @beansinpain @utahjazz Just wondering bc I have a lot of his rookie cards lol@JazzUniTracker @utahjazz These look really great@utahjazz Happy birthday coach!

Instead, well, they're 1-4. Their +0.10 Adjusted Shot Quality rating is second in the NBA behind only the Utah Jazz (+0.11). In theory the team should be much better.

#NBA https://t.co/J9vycZtkO2The Utah Jazz have a chance to go undefeated this season. No other NBA team can say that. #takenote@LegendOfWinning That’s true but the Utah Jazz are 2nd in the NBA with a 96 defensive rating (3rd all time in shot clock era) while also having the top rated offense this year. Hopefully Jimmy &amp; Herro keep having career scoring years@CallistroFlores @utahjazz Every W we get a pizza review 🤭 @DallyELCheck out this listing I just added to my #Poshmark closet: Donovan Mitchell Nike Utah Jazz jersey size 48 (L). https://t.co/2MDpQjvoW4 #shopmycloset @poshmarkapp@ThisHerePodcast @NekiasNBA I don’t think the Bucks, Heat, Lakers, Warriors, Nets, Suns or even the Clippers are concerned about the Utah Jazz.@McCadeP8 That’s all true. My issue with the jazz is that we haven’t made a “win at all costs” move in well over a decade at least. The lack of aggression is systemic and the number 1 thing standing between us and the LOB trophy. Moreso than being the Utah Jazz imo@tonyparks801 Happy birthday jazz coach Snyder from the biggest Utah jazz  fan since 1979  from Gary Burke from west Jordan@utahjazz Is he…no longer with us?

#NBA75 https://t.co/fckNUXId2C@SportsCenter The @celtics and @Lakers have the worst defenses in the league right now. The @LAClippers are (1-4). The @MiamiHEAT and @nuggets have the best defenses in the league right now. The @nyknicks @chicagobulls &amp; @WashWizards are (4-1) and the @utahjazz are still undefeated. #early*types tweet, hits send and walks away from phone*

I would trade a BYU loss and Utah Jazz loss today for my Atlanta Braves to go up 3-1 in the #WorldSeries #BattleATLIf the Honda Fit is called the Honda Jazz outside of the states, are the Utah Jazz called the Utah Fit elsewhere as well? 🤔Good Saturday morning everyone, except the St Louis Blues and Utah Jazz. 

Nothing against the Utah Jazz, but still! #Blackhawks #BullsNation@GenZ_UtahJazz Feeling pretty confident I see….@JordanClarksons and @JaylenGreen score in more ways than one in their first #NBA game against each other. https://t.co/r6tVBxBGIu

5.

If a player has a three-year contract with an option for the fourth season, that means if the option is exercised (by the team in this example), the contract extends through the fourth season.@BrianCr28986856 @Haak_Eric @tribjazz @utahjazz My analytics were right on. Conley has a sore knee and can't play. Already. I told you so. Washed up. Not good enough to start for the Jazz.@sportsiren @NBA @utahjazz Holly, if the Jazz win A Championship this year, you should get a lifetime contract. You might be the difference this year. You just seem to fit with these guys. #GoUtes20:15 – ⚽🇦🇷Campeonato Argentino

(+)The current Clippers aren't that much different from the one that beat the Utah Jazz and pushed the Suns to Game 6 in the playoffs. It's hard to believe that only missing Patrick Beverley would cause this. But it's also starting to look like Reggie &amp; Bledsoe isn't a good combo.@BensHoops @utahjazz I have a hunch that HASSAN, will feel at home in Utah, and just like CONLEY, he will re-sign and stay until we win that coveted Trophy🤗😉😉The Jazz are unbeaten in three games and will look to extend their run against the Chicago Bulls with a win in this encounter.

If Eric Paschall starts hit the corner 3 as consistently at PJ Tucker while keeping up that defensive intensity, the Jazz will win it all.@GenZ_UtahJazz @marc2sn3s PJ Tucker is one of the most underrated players in the NBA right now imo. Someone who’s able to (and not afraid to) really annoy the Kevin Durants of the NBA. While also hitting the corner 3 at a very efficient rate. Bucks don’t beat the Nets last year w/out him.NBA ML.

Other teams do shoot with volume, but there's something so intentional and designed about the way the Jazz do it. It really is special. It's not just "jacking up as many 3s as possible".

They won’t have Mike Conley, Rudy Gay, and Hassan Whiteside so that already gives us a huge boost imo. We have Lonzo who can hopefully contain Mitchell and Gobert has never really been a scoring threat.
