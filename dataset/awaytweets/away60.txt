Los Angeles Lakers 107@TheHoopCentral As a honest los Angeles Lakers fan I have to admit that we are a finished franchiseI believe Austin Reaves is going to be a bright spot for the Los Angeles Lakers. 
He's already looking like an upgraded version of Kyle Kuzma.
Reaves game is more complete and he uses his size to his advantage. 
His game IQ is great and he gels with any lineup nicely.
