Currently don't see LaMelo Ball on the floor, but nothing official yet.Knicks PG Kemba Walker is listed as our for today’s game against his former Charlotte Hornets team BUT pre-game Walker was putting up shots and looked pretty loose.

I’m excited for his return sooner rather than later.Today, @TSN_Sports delivers a triple-header of @NBA games as the league celebrates the legacy of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. TSN's #MLKDay coverage includes @hornets vs. @nyknicks at 1 p.m. ET, @chicagobulls vs. @memgrizz at 3:30 p.m. ET &amp; @Bucks vs. @ATLHawks at 6 p.m. ET. https://t.co/XuVsRHeRpt"Every NBA player relishes a chance to play today."

And by price coming down what would you like that to be? It’s so tough Turner would be good in Charlotte but at what cost does it become pointless@AlexBMG00 @hornets And leave Simmons with no one to play with?@_Shakeem @hornets Im still very down if they package Sabonis and brogdon for SimmonsToday is a NATIONALLY televised 1:00 p.m. Eastern game so you know what that means #Hornets fans. Charlotte &amp; surrounding areas are snowed in &amp; it’s a national holiday so many will be tuning in for this game. #allfly  #NBATV@AlexBMG00 @hornets Turner’s defense is more valuable. And his spacing ability. He fits perfect with Lamelo.@hornets It hurts y’all to put LaMelo on one of these game advertisements doesn’t it? After all, it IS MLK Day. Don’t hashtag the day and then put Gordon Hayward on the cover. Come on. Yes, I’m calling it out. 💅🏾@_Shakeem @hornets Take Sabonis instead, I honestly think Turners Defense is more valuable for a team@CrownClubCLT @hornets And they canceled the MLK watch party at the Spectrum due to the snow!@CCCofGastonia @NBATV @hornets @nyknicks No trust me, I watch every game is all about having contol,vteachong lessons punishing him for a mistake or a flashy play, he got benched after the through the legs pass, JB was disgussted with that playJust a friendly reminder that the @Hornets play at 1:00 PM today‼️@best_impact @NBATV @hornets @nyknicks It definitely feels like this at times.
