Suckafree Sports Live - Los Angeles Lakers Vs New York Knicks (Watch-Along &amp; Play By Play) üèÄ https://t.co/5vBogne87PNEW YOEK KNICKS VS LOS ANGELES LAKERS LIVE PLAY BY PLAY REACTION! https://t.co/e8gMPikKZFThe Los Angeles Lakers defense is ranked 23rd in the NBA with 111 points allowed per 100 possessions.

I saw some plays of the Detroit game. Their defense looks horrible.

Their offense is also 23rd in the NBA; without LeBron I think the Knicks are obligated to win this one.Soon, I‚Äôm going to watch NBA Basketball (Los Angeles Lakers at New York Knicks) on TNT.Invest in the future.
