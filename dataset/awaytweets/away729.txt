Danuel House Jr. has quite the past in the NBA, one that certain fans are willing to forget. Should the Utah Jazz let it go and give him another NBA contract? [Update: they did. Another 10-day; not a full year tho.]

The other 20% is religion &amp; politics.I haven't heard a word back, and I sent this email last Friday.  I'm beginning to feel like the last six seasons I have been a ST holder don't matter, because @utahjazz can just replace me.  Kind of sad for a lifelong fan. @RyanQualtrics what would you suggest I do?@McCadeP8 All of the Utah Jazz players are my sons. You will have to pry them from my cold dead hands if you want to trade them. I refuse to talk trades. Lol.@SpencerKeele @utahjazz @ZionsBank @Joeingles7 I know he's having a down year but it's kind of sad to see how most of the fan base has turned on him.@thisjimmy12 @ATLHawks @sixers @celtics @utahjazz Idk it sounds like the obstacle for the Hawks is Tobias Harris.

How about...

@ATLHawks --&gt; Ben Simmons &amp; Schroder.
@sixers --&gt; Collins, Bogdanovic, Smart, Richardson, &amp; one 1st from ATL.

Who says no? https://t.co/tyHkxNmHKE@SpencerKeele You do know that they have only missed three games this season together right?

I don't understand why Utah Jazz fans for the most part do not like to give credit to teams.

https://t.co/YjYXWMGLH2

#NBA #Grizzlies #JazzMy bold prediction for the @utahjazz post All-Star break. They finish the season as the 3 seed and make the NBA finals. Yeah, they’ve had a rough stretch with real adversity but I think they pull together and finally get healthy to make a run.@utahjazz Mike Conley 40 ptsOffseason Outlook: Miami Heat and Utah Jazz https://t.co/5d4sOvEavj@MackSikes83 @RyanwShort @utahjazz the picture was taken before all-star voting was announced. you all read way too much into things and take everyone way too seriously. this type of speculation is not healthy.@nation_first87 @nicola_lot5 @utahjazz Concussions are serious. Has nothing to do with being soft.Rudy Gobert (calf) and Donovan Mitchell (concussion) are still out for the Jazz. Neither will be available against Memphis tonight. #utahjazz #NBA#UtahJazz #Jazz two-way PG-SG Trent Forrest has a sprained right ankle, questionable for today's game.On the latest "How 'Bout This Jazz" podcast episode, the guys break down the Utah Jazz's losing streak, as well as discuss if it’s time for the Jazz to make one (or several) moves in order to realistically compete for a title. https://t.co/spvuIXcm47@utedaddy Utah Jazz should have changed their name to the Sucksaphones.

I mean, it happened in the first half and he played the rest of the game. 🤔Don't worry Utah Jazz fans, I just donated my left calf to Rudy Gobert. I'm super old &amp; only 5' 3" so he's going to stretch it out before using it. 💔❤🙏🏼🦵@kylepford @utahjazz Neither are the Jazz

Great interview w/ @NBASarah who covers the @utahjazz for @Deseret in Salt Lake City. ✅ it out! ⬇️⬇️🔊🔊 https://t.co/CCRUWL1Xm2@JordanClarksons We need dancin Clarkson! #TakeNote #utahjazz https://t.co/sVi5tOFk3u@russel7nambatac I think it's the "team team-based" stigma around successful teams that stray voters away to consider them as "all-star starters". Just like the Utah Jazz last year definitely should be at least one all-star starter from those teams.What does Black History Month mean to you? 🎨

We want to see your art themed around basketball, history, and the Black experience for a chance to have your design produced and featured on apparel and ticket to attend a Jazz game this season.

I'll DM you my CV.🤪@tc91585 @SpencerKeele @NBA Number of people following your team? What better way to answer that question than 14th in viewership among all NBA teams...in most recent data. So more people are "following" Utah Jazz in comparison to their market size anyway@JasonIsbell That’s a tough reference for a @utahjazz fan, but mad respect, Mr. Isbell.@utahjazz An absolute icon@aaronsmit07 @kslsports @utahjazz Maybe has something to do with the way the fans shunned him through the BLM stuff as well. It’s going to be funny to watch Jazz fans never see a Jazz championship and they move to another city.@adamclanton @abbyhornacek @SportsMT @HoustonRockets @utahjazz A little piece of me died reading this.   I need to fully hate him.@JasonIsbell Who is your Utah Jazz?@utahjazz @BucketsONeale00 what are you playing on the speaker? 😎@utahjazz Hell I’m buying this promo but going by myself. Know your worth. Spoil yourself.utahjazz whiteside has🧂 0 drive or motivation and sold the match f@JeromeJordie @leojmatt @guythanosddd @RealSkipBayless The won against the Utah Jazz ain’t they a decent team lolI am also told there has been finger pointing and verbal altercations in the Utah Jazz locker room centered around Rudy Gobert calling out guys for a lack of effort, but when teammates called Gobert out for constant complaining to officials, Gobert did not react well.@adamclanton @abbyhornacek @SportsMT @HoustonRockets @utahjazz How wonderful. Way back machine from some good times.@adamclanton @abbyhornacek @SportsMT @HoustonRockets @utahjazz And his brothers John and Karl lmao@adamclanton @abbyhornacek @SportsMT @HoustonRockets @utahjazz Did you at least kick him in the balls for the 1997 Western Conference Finals?@utahjazz hey @spidadmitchell will u?💘Will you be our Valentine?💘

Make your Valentine's Day extra special this year with dinner and a game. 

🎟 https://t.co/G3RjofwGp1 https://t.co/7bf4PZE30xUtah Jazz has got to be the most antithetically named sports team of all timeYo @KingJames and @KDTrey5, I want both of yall to do the "Utah jazz treatment" to Andrew Wiggins this year. Pick him last or disrespect him, choice is yours. 
Thank you@SNYtv This team is so overrated. @utahjazz need a huge trade. They never gonna win a ring with that roster.Prediction: Utah Jazz get everyone healthy by the game on Feb. 2nd on ESPN (home against DEN). Jazz win and look really good. It gets the season back on track and the Jazz go into the All Star break winning at least 6 of the last 8 games.@utahjazz Hope 2022 be the last 🙏Watching NBA hardwood classics, Nuggets v. Jazz in 1995, where Gonzaga's John Stockton breaks the assist record. This play was called a travel. Even the announcers thought it was a travel. Rodney Rodgers is still shaking his head. Times have changed. #nuggets #utahjazz https://t.co/dfK90mOOHs@utahjazz @ZionsBank We are so lucky to have JC!!!@utahjazz The second five had a better all round performance. What happened to Bogey? We need more from him on the same nights that Clarkson and Mitchell score well. We can't win if they take it in turns@utahjazz Hard to believe he was only 36@rubenjpotter @BurnerClarkson @utahjazz Any game@utahjazz He's getting traded is he?@jthayne_91 @spidadmitchell @utahjazz I HOPE HE LEAVES SO WE CAN ALL STOP TALKING ABOUT IT.I just want to give a shout-out to @efrandsen and @ajaysalvy for the awesome show today. I really enjoyed the Utah Jazz segment talking about Donovan Mitchell, and the text-line with listeners is unlike any other sports radio station in the state.@Frog_Feathers @jthayne_91 @spidadmitchell @utahjazz Remember that girlfriend that broke your heart and then a way better girl came along that you married? Mitchell is a 6’1” guard that’s pretty good, but there’s 20-30 guys in the league better than him. Gobert is the prize. Very few in the NBA can do what Gobert does.@utahjazz Can this be his last?@BurnerClarkson @utahjazz what game??????#TBT to 2014 &amp; Joe Ingles’ first season in the NBA ☕️ https://t.co/QehWhDd43TCan someone tell me why Donovan Mitchell should be talked like he's Damion or Giannis in trading when he can't make the  ASG Western Conference Starter? #NBAAllStar #utahjazz #TakeNoteYikes. We @utahjazz fans did not do our job well. @rudygobert27 should be starting. https://t.co/WTGMElY1EN@JamesWClawson @NBA @utahjazz So bad! https://t.co/oxRn42nRTYDevin Booker *43-12-4* and the Phoenix Suns beat Jordan Clarkson *26-5-2* and the Utah Jazz 105-97 (2022-01-26)@washedwiz @utahjazz Lowkey disrespectful bro you gotta chill 😂Devin Booker racked up 43 points and 12 rebounds as the Phoenix Suns extended their winning streak to eight matches with a 105-97 win over the Utah Jazz-Zamkuwire https://t.co/WHG2F1P3GV@JamesWClawson @NBA @utahjazz It’s infuriating. When the Jazz were the top team last year you could see the collective annoyance all over the league and national media. The League treats them like the Washington Generals. Shut up and play 2nd fiddle to the brand names. Pisses me off. NFL so much better.Can't listen to Jazz music ever since @utahjazz #TakeNote 

Seriously, did no one tell Utah it's not 1999 anymore?? https://t.co/a5xUNDTc0G@troykburnett @NBA @utahjazz My biggest fear….@JamesWClawson @NBA @utahjazz Fan voting massively favors the larger market teams. The NBA treats the mid market teams like shit.Special thanks to @NBASarah for joining us on the @EthosGrizzlies podcast 🗣 @memgrizz @utahjazz ahead of tomorrow night’s game. It’ll drop later this evening!@washedwiz @utahjazz Almost Lol@kslnewsradio @KSLRikki @utahjazz @spidadmitchell Rick is a jerk just trying to cause trouble . He hates the jazz and has always said so .Maybe I dont deserve to be a Jazz fan. I expected Gobert and Mitchell to not make the starting team since Utah Jazz isn't much of a popular team.When will we all realize the Utah Jazz will always be frauds. They do just enough to hang around that 4th-6th seed to get in the playoffs and choke. No one is ever worried about the jazz. https://t.co/FFjA3jwb4lHere are the top five Utah Jazz teams of all time — and the five worst ones - Salt Lake Tribune https://t.co/rXGBTlMygvSports talk:
If the Utah Jazz doesn't make a move by All-star break and then has a first-round playoff exit, then the front office should all be fired.*

*if they get swept in the 2nd round, then the same action should be taken.In light of Wiggins being an All Star Starter I guess we can start listing the all time Starting five for each team with the Wiggins effect. #NBAAIIStar 

#UtahJazz
John Stockton
Donovan Mitchell
Pete Maravich 
Adam Keefe &lt;-
Rudy Gobert@Theone3420 @maxisnicee That is true! They underestimate some players just because it was impossible to beat MJ. Poor Chuck is Always bullied by #Shaq for not winning. But Shaq/Kobe couldn’t beat #utahjazz that Lost to MJ…. Twice!! Even Hakeem wouldn’t win 🏆 if MJ wasn’t out ‘94-‘95.This is an awful joke… Don deserved better 😳 @NBA is rigged… 

 As a @utahjazz fan this is what worries me most about Don staying here… 

#TakeNote https://t.co/wnednxoGfd@EricSal_7 Tell me you didn’t watch that era of Utah Jazz basketball without telling me you didn’t watch that era of Utah Jazz  basketball 😂I’m not very good at this game. 27/45

#TakeNote @utahjazz@jthayne_91 @spidadmitchell @utahjazz So true, but I gotta admit that it gives me a sick feeling to think of @spidadmitchell ever leaving @utahjazz . After everything that the team/fans went through with D-Will, Sloan &amp; Hayward, Don was the breath of fresh air that made the Jazz an exciting team to watch again. #hero@GrizzliesPR @memgrizz @utahjazz Was hoping for better news 😭How the fuck does @22wiggins get an all star start over @spidadmitchell or @rudygobert27 ?!?!?!?! 👀 👀 👀. Absolute bullshit. #utahjazz #NBAAllStar@jthayne_91 @spidadmitchell @utahjazz If he gos he gos nothing to worry about or be mad over just basketball y’all@utahjazz At least it's not a thread of injuries anymore 😉Utah Jazz center Rudy Gobert injury history and updates
