Surprising to see that the Bulls scored 103 and 109 while being so efficient with their shots.

Real cute. https://t.co/gRmn5G8g6mFun fact: the "jock tax" (a tax on athletes) was popularized by the 1991 NBA finals when California taxed the Chicago Bulls on games played in LA.

Illinois retaliated with one of its own designed to tax the LA Lakers on games played in Chicago! 🤯
