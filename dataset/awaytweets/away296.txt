Coincidentally I follow them all too.THE CHARLOTTE HORNETS PLAY BASKETBALL TODAY@cgalloway704 @hornets @HoustonRockets @NBA Agreed. I know some teams have hired nutritionists and sleep specialists to tell the players when and what is the best time to eat and sleep@vDodun @hornets @HoustonRockets @NBA I don't think they consider that honestly“They don’t understand what they got”: LaVar Ball slams Charlotte Hornets for not letting LiAngelo Ball play alongside LaMelo #SmartNews  https://t.co/GRzHbtw06r@cgalloway704 @hornets @HoustonRockets @NBA Where’s the financial incentive though? Wouldn’t you want them to be fully rested for a more competitive game?Correction. The Hornets had a day off before they played at Golden State. However, the Hornets had played back-to-back games in Charlotte before flying to California. Technically our “day off” was a flight to the West Coast. Meanwhile the Warriors previous game was 3 days prior.A long stretch but it seems like the original @hornets /@OrlandoMagic /@Raptors uniforms paved the way for today's city jerseys.

Before them kids wore their favorite player's jersey but   nobody wore jerseys for style. Starter jackets etc helped along the way. https://t.co/vJFrctv2pCStay ready. Why that phrase is becoming a mantra for the surging Charlotte Hornets
