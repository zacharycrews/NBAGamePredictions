Utah Jazz's point... Mike Conley

Shockingly Smart / Conley are very close statistically. Conley has more points, less turnovers, more efficient. 

I love Smart but he is not a great distributor, yet.@utahjazz I don't think the Jazz can win without Gobert, he is the best player they have and without him ther is litteraly no defence@JustinUtley @utahjazz @hornets @NBA @RyanQualtrics @UtahJazzPR @utahjazzbear Congratulations Justin!Detroit Pistons vs. Utah Jazz: TV, radio, more information on Monday night's game https://t.co/SNG7OJX17nUtah Jazz vs. Detroit Pistons - NBA (1/10/22) | Tip-Off, How to Watch https://t.co/fwTflnomUmUtah Jazz vs. Detroit Pistons - NBA (1/10/22) | Tip-Off, How to Watch https://t.co/ZSMFQSY2G4🔥Monday🔥

Until then The Chargers are the Utah Jazz of the NFL.Y'all remember how Adam Silver told the Gordon Hayward Utah Jazz to take a dive on Kobe's last game? This is the NFL equivalent...@ChrisFedor Any way the @NBA can let the @cavs play @OrlandoMagic or the @DetroitPistons every night, so their ignorant fans can think they’re good. Shitty @SacramentoKings next, then another loss at @utahjazz #stillshittyWe play the Utah Jazz tomorrow night at LCA… @CadeCunningham_ is averaging 24.0 points 7.7 rebounds 6.7 assists on 49% shooting and 48% from three on Monday’s!!!
