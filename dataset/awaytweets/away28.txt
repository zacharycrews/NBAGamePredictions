That’s a very tricky equation. In NBA development is code for lots of losing &amp; learning from it. Very different from trying to win. If there is too much losing with development it can impact cultureIs there going to be some kind of partnership between #AMC and the @sixers / the @NBA ? Silverback hanging out with Sixers rep has me thinking. Remember @mcuban accepts crypto payments for @dallasmavs . Is there some kind of advertising partnership in works?

This is yr 3 with Luka and Porzingas, do  they give it to the break or play the season out and see how it works?@mid36372284 @TheAthletic @luka7doncic @dallasmavs @TheAthleticNBA All I gotta say is, COLOR OF SKIN plays a lot in decisions made today like it did 100 plus years ago. Truth be told, if this were Westbrook, they'd bring up his turnovers, how many missed shots, etc to downplay the accomplishments. Like they trying to downplay Trae's playoff run.@TheAthletic @luka7doncic @dallasmavs @TheAthleticNBA So what's the record for the MOST turnovers in a players first 200 games? I'd bet He has more of those than LeBron did in his first 200 games. Oh! he also has more first round playoff exits his first 200 games than LeBron does as well.

That being said, Rondo absolutely should at least be fined. As a Dallas Mavericks fan, I'd prefer a lifetime ban from basketball.@dallasmavs @BallySportsSW What is the deal with the local teams opening their seasons with multiple games on the road. Mavs open on the road with 2, Cowboys open on the road with 2, Stars open on the road with 4.
