He also showed promising results in his debut Wednesday against the Charlotte Hornets by scoring 27 points. https://t.co/F4nMfBuXp9@zamesss1 @BigBorregoBrand @hornets 30 of 70 paint points came from Ja Morant btw lmao. I knew Ja is a Great Finisher but damn they can't stop a 6'3 dude.@SimpleCRE @realkellye @hornets Dell Curry - Original NBA Jam - He’s on fire!Interesting. LiAngelo Ball will be up for grabs in the G League draft tomorrow. Looks like there have been some complications with the Charlotte Hornets 👀

#NBAGLeague https://t.co/h1eQ2wlgE6@realkellye @hornets My wife hates it, but I wouldn't trade it for anything. It's either the jacket or the Dell Curry throwback for every game.@SimpleCRE @hornets This is awesome.Here’s what you need to know as the Charlotte Hornets take on the Cleveland Cavaliers on Friday night.  https://t.co/kuJDdQVCQT@SimpleCRE @hornets This is pic is awesome! Jacket is cool too.LiAngelo Ball was announced by the Charlotte Hornets as being signed and waived, but became draft-eligible for all G League teams due to procedural issues that prevent him from being an affiliate player of the Hornets G League team, the Greensboro Swarm, per source. https://t.co/TM9iTPoedOWhat's the one thing outside of work/family that is your passion? That gets you so fired up that it surprises people? For me, it's basketball. As you can see below, I trade in my bow tie for a Starter jacket and go nuts. The best stress reliever!
