[FD(44.6) DK(46.5)]@McLeod919 LOVE Basketball. I am a Chicago native when the Bulls were big so that was my first love but later switched to the Spurs since my dad is a San Antonio Native and we lived there when they won the title. And I am a Tar Heel. Aside from that, Cubs for baseball.Not a huge crowd at Capital One Arena tonight but they're seeing plenty of offense. The Wizards are 11-of-18 from 3-point range at halftime, but they trail the Spurs 75-71. San Antonio has 44 points in the paint.🍿Popcorn's Pick (Live bet )
