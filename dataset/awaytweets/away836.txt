3* #557/558 Minnesota Timberwolves &amp; Chicago Bulls OVER 240.5@LakerCentral365 The Lakers are in the top 5 in the league in spending. Spending doesn’t guarantee anything. 

See Los Angeles Clippers and Minnesota Timberwolves.@Hamps59 @Smith4Gm @MDBobz Also LA Rams and Colorado state Rams; Denver broncos and Boise state broncos. But supposedly they didn't name Washington the redwolves because they were worried about trademarking issues with the Minnesota timberwolves and other franchises with wolves in their name. It's stupid.The Minnesota Timberwolves got the NBA Trade Deadline right
