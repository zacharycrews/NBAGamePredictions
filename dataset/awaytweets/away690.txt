The first five should include Bill Russell and John Havlicek, most appropriately instead of DJ &amp; KG.@BostonRob @celtics Before that @UConnWBB 😀Anyone who thinks the Boston Celtics have a developmental program need to read this.

❤️⭐️⭐️Boston vainqueur (1.80) (BK)
⭐️ Jayson Tatum +2.5 3points (2.20)
🍀 Jayson Tatum inscrit 30 points ou plus (2.70) https://t.co/lrucQqivm8I saw the video where I got in a fight with Boston Celtics but I don't remember it. I confronted them all in a train next day-they just swore at me.
Doctors and nurses took me away but they let me walk to my hospital room on my own. I received cheers for doing so.
Weird dream.@BostonRob @celtics Buckets!@celtics @ArbellaIns Why are people getting upset? This is obviously not the top 5. I’m iffy on Garnett too but I’d need to see the whole list. I saw what I considered a pretty solid top 15 recently and it had Garnett.@MrMattson43 @MikeWBaseball @celtics @ArbellaIns I did read the article it’s just weird having a 3 random group of 5s in no order@MannyJamesmusic @Zeno1273 @celtics Facts. No sense at all. I’m ok with his lineups not working. But don’t keep trying them repeatedly. It makes no sense at all.@celtics No fucking way@celtics @ArbellaIns Bill Russell@celtics Everything to put freedom in rotation.@celtics Pls don’t go double big pls for the love of god@celtics @ArbellaIns You're missing Bill Russell, Bob Cousy, and Rajon Rondo@celtics lmao, still the same loser players@celtics Stop playing with 2 bigs@celtics Good to know@celtics Hoping we play better because our shooting be so terrible at times:((@celtics Win a game@celtics Excuse me, “Problem???”@celtics nobody cares@celtics Player does well*

Go C's!@JoyMantz @smart_MS3 @celtics @Larry_Bird_33 He’s in college. You can’t sign him.@smart_MS3 When do we sign him? The @celtics need that same attitude. That was a @Larry_Bird_33 thing to do.Let me get this straight: @celtics are playing .500 ball this season. They have good players. However, something has to be done with the coaching staff…@StevenM88824872 @celtics @ArbellaIns @RealBillRussell You talking about yourself cuz you cant read or?@celtics @ArbellaIns The amount of people in this comment section that don't know how to read is astounding.

Not putting Bill Russell on the top of any Celtic team is like leaving Bobby Orr off a top Bruins team or Ted Williams off a top Red Sox team. Whoever voted on this is nuts!@celtics @ArbellaIns no,bob cousey@CELTICSVSREFS @jaytatum0 @celtics I totally agree, if we don’t stop giving Tatum shit in the media we are going to loose him. The point is the Celtics have let some many players walk out the door because they didn’t want to pay them. No one to blame but the owners!!!!!!!!@celtics @ArbellaIns That team of the 1986 Boston Celtics are considered one of the best ever teams in the history of the NBA 🏀🏀@celtics @John_Karalis @ArbellaIns Bill Russel???@celtics @ArbellaIns Paul Pierce robbed@Mikemizowski @celtics So is Tacko...@MannyJamesmusic @Zeno1273 @celtics Most of it comes down to rotations. Certain guys play better with other guys. His first idea of playing the jays separately doesn’t work. It makes you a mediocre team across the board where as if you play them both you deal with peaks and valleys. Plus his use of game rhythm.@NBAReactz @Zeno1273 @celtics This is it. That’s what I keep saying. Even if we make great moves. If he doesn’t maximize the potential of each player and the team as a whole then we will still be mediocre. At best! To me most of it falls on him.@celtics @WashWizards @NBCSBoston @985TheSportsHub NFL playoffs are on, not watching@celtics @ArbellaIns Oh shit, I just read below...Bill Russell? Who picked this?????@Davefevs @AmyFilton @BristolFlyers @tokyo_time Any chance of shipping on to #Boston ? - I’ll trade it for a @celtics one if you like?@Modekongen @_collinsexton @celtics @ArbellaIns Read between the lines. The listing of the players on the 1st 2nd and 3rd teams aren't in any order. But this is the 1st team.

Example: this is the 1st team, but they aren't saying Larry was 1st, KG was 2nd, etc. That's what they mean when they say "in no particular order.@BostonRob @celtics What a play! 👏🏻@celtics Talent is not enough to winPlease get Kennard @celtics@TheNBACentral Be a perfect @celtics ….. Would give up several 1st round picks for him.  @BCCoachStevens@CELTICSVSREFS @jaytatum0 @celtics Totally disagree with everything you saidAs an arsenal-Boston celtics fan, my pain tolerance just keeps going up.This could be us @celtics but you didn't surround the Jays with a real basketball players. https://t.co/dlVEU3pf5o@BostonRob @celtics Sign her up@celtics @ArbellaIns I get that this is only 5 of 15, but is this the first team? I don't think it is alphabetical, lol, so if it isn't the first team then why announce these 5? No all time Celtic list should ever be shared without Russell and Bird as the first two names spoken!@celtics @ArbellaIns The fact that there’s no Bill Russell gives me even less hope that this org will ever turn it aroundSo the @celtics better win today !BE A GOOD GUY TO HAVE @celtics https://t.co/2DQWomyWNp#NBA

Same thing.@Gustavo83368455 @celtics yeah Nesmith is decent@Josh_Viv @celtics @ArbellaIns thats the point. the fact Russell isn't on the FIRST is embarrassing.@celtics @ArbellaIns This has to be a mistake or rough draft?? Where's BILL RUSSELL??? He's dftnly 1st team Celtics He's the main reason players wanted to be a on the Celtics &amp; why we have 🏆 pls delete &amp; correct this!@buckscience @celtics @ArbellaIns I read it the same way you did. Not a great look to do it this way.@celtics @ArbellaIns Fun to think about... here's my 1st 5.
Bird, Russell, Pierce, Cousy, Jones@celtics @ArbellaIns Bill Russell has to be in the first five, just like Havlicek and Pierce should be.@celtics @ArbellaIns Where’s Bill Russell? This is embarrassing.WATCH: What is going on with Jayson Tatum’s shot this season with the Boston Celtics? https://t.co/7ncI20tPKB@celtics @ArbellaIns Wow only 15 make the cut!? Some stink going to get raised after everyone is announced more than likely. 😳😳@DerekJanuary22 @celtics @ArbellaIns Probably.  I give Garnett credit not only for the title but for making the Celtics watchable again.  Would've been awesome to watch McHale's post moves vs KG's defense in their primes.@JaviGR66 @DespachoCeltics @celtics De Slytherin@MannyJamesmusic @Zeno1273 @celtics Since when. Everything I’ve seen says 6-8 at most.@CoachCarroll29 @celtics @ArbellaIns I debated Cousy over Pierce but McHale definitely over Garnett!@_collinsexton @celtics @ArbellaIns I am right.

Did a lakers fan do this? 🤦🏼‍♂️🤦🏼‍♂️🤦🏼‍♂️🤦🏼‍♂️@TheReal_Wes @celtics @ArbellaIns You’re right. The Boston Celtics 75 anniversary teams officially determined Dennis Johnson and Garnett are better Celtics than bill Russell and Cousy. Definitely not random just like the NBA 75 anniversary list was released in random groups.@DerekJanuary22 @celtics @ArbellaIns It's really tough to pick 5.  Russell, Bird, Havlicek, Cousy and either (McHale, Parrish, Pierce, Garnett)@celtics @ArbellaIns I like these 5 but I had a sentimental favorite in Paul Pierce!!!@celtics @WashWizards @NBCSBoston @985TheSportsHub Hauser deserves at least 5 mins of playing time damn it@CoachPratt32 @celtics @ArbellaIns Ahhh ok that makes more sense@celtics Oh cool, cant wait to watch the game https://t.co/lQo44GagY3@celtics @ArbellaIns Stupid on a whole new level.

His impact is unmatched.@celtics @ArbellaIns where TF is Bill Russell???@_collinsexton @celtics @ArbellaIns It clearly is. When you filled out the form they had they had a 1st, 2nd and 3rd team. This is the all Celtics 1st team and Russell isn't on it.@celtics @ArbellaIns Bird, Russell, McHale, Havlicek, Pierce@celticszn @celtics @ArbellaIns Read the article. They are being released in 3 groups of 5 and in no particular order.@celtics Fully healthy and still gonna get your shit kicked in lmaoooo@celtics @ArbellaIns sure idgaf they legends buh please go on a streak winning streak not no damn losing streak@TheReal_Wes @celtics @ArbellaIns It’s not a ranked thing@celtics @ArbellaIns Bill?@celtics @ArbellaIns Where is Jabari Parker@celtics @ArbellaIns Russell, Pierce, and Hondo?!??@celtics @ArbellaIns Isaiah Thomas better be on 3rd teamThe results are in and the first five members of the 75th Anniversary All-Celtics Team presented by @ArbellaIns are in ☘️

If you replace Jason Tatum with Julius Randle, its identical to Knick reddit.IT would be perfect for the @celtics rn @isaiahthomas @jaytatum0 @FCHWPO@TimofConcrete @SmartDpoy @MaineCeltics @celtics You probably believe there was really a chicken that crossed a road, huh?!@rioberalph1218 @John_Karalis Eventually the Maine Celtics are gonna end up playing in the Garden when they keep performing better than the Boston CelticsAaron Rodgers is the 2008 Boston Celtics!! Still MILKING THAT ONE RING 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 https://t.co/mY1IpPpwlI@CTGREENTEAMERS You could be completely right.  I am certainly no NBA General Manager.  My fear is that they continue to under achieve to where their value diminishes.  Both, IMO, could demand a hefty return.  Either way something HAS to be done.  This is the Boston Celtics.the single worst part of being a part of @celtics twitter is the crossover with @Patriots and #garoppolo twitter. eat shit you fucking losers. you're gonna lose anyways because you're fucking losers who support 3 teams (pats, bucs, 49ers) you fucking losers@CELTICSVSREFS @jaytatum0 @celtics Im done with “Tatum’s not the problem” take. No doubt, hes our best player. But he takes some of the dumbest shots at end of games. If you think that shot last night was a “good shot” because he had a little space, youre wrong. Drive, and score. Or, drive and pass. He cant win rn@CELTICSVSREFS @jaytatum0 @celtics Yeah and when he makes shots we know @CELTICSVSREFS will not give him credit! Because it would be hypocritical to say he won a game for making shots when he can't be blamed for missing shots!@John_Karalis Boston Celtics could neverWhy can’t the BOSTON Celtics be this good huh Wtf https://t.co/TR77vCaXpG2010 NBA Finals Los Angeles Lakers vs Boston Celtics FULL VIDEOS G3 https://t.co/ghSRA9KkzV via @YouTube@MaineCeltics @celtics @Big_Smooth10 Should replace the real Celtics.@celtics Is iso-iso-iso-iso, bad shot, bad shot, bad shot, crap 3, crap 3, crap 3, no rebounding and bad D, the same as a scoring drought???

But if u need his salary to match up and C's also get 1st round pick then ok@JH47900883 @27Inor @celtics The other guys certainly could have moved more but a) there’s plenty of time left to find a good shot, and b) they know Tatum is not going to pass anyway..At what point do the @celtics accept that they're atrocious and that it's tanking time? Also I'm still down for just going ahead and trading off any player that watched Kryrie stomp on that logo last year.@JohnnyH004 @McDTwin1 @celtics Also, if you’ve missed 19 straight 3 pointers, pretty much literally every shot is better than this. Also, it’s super easy to defend because all teams know what he’s going to do.@JohnnyH004 @McDTwin1 @celtics I bet you are. But there are 7-8 seconds left on the clock man. PLENTY of time to find a better shot. And all other players had 0-1 players guarding them. That’s a lower number than 2… you know?@1_mattitude @celtics I am not sure I’d go that far. I think a good Coach AND a good GM  could work wonders@JimLegere @celtics Did he miss 19 three pointers in a row? No?
