76ers - Embiid playing out of his mind and great team chemistry will be hard to slow down!@Jacko2544 @sixers @BrooklynNets Love that your on the good side, love watching you every game. Let’s get this dub tonight!!!@DaGodMCee @AdamSchefter @BrooklynNets Our season seems lost at this point. The amount of things that have gone against us is comical. Harden quitting, not having Kyrie, Joe Harris’ injury, KD injury and of course the guy we traded for still doesn’t want to play. 🤦🏻‍♂️ https://t.co/xedltaoL7C@Boards2Buckets @sixers @BrooklynNets @cicalese @M2Jimbo @SquiddyNFT @dbarri12 @davistommyj @HustlinShowroom @ChewieWoolf @magicsticksz @roguetrader21 @therealericking @AwPtical__ @nftmikeymike @SanYEGcisco TS: darcyt14

Gonna be a rowdy one tonight@BrooklynNets @HSpecialSurgery Y’all should have made up a better reason for Ben or use like medical terms like Spondylolysis or something 🤷‍♀️🗣️Getcha🍿ready 2night @BrooklynNets vs @sixers #ItsGoingDown 💥🔥🔥@SunSunS71984530 @rspeasant I wish I was in Miami. At least I saw him play the Nets in Brooklyn@BrooklynNets Ben Simmons gotta show us U can play, you can shut down the Beard show the fans what your made of. Hope your not afraid of playing a kids game pulling 4 U kid@ceeknowledge @sixers @BrooklynNets Naw brah! We are going to light up Saint Simmons! He wants to blame us the fans that supported him for years for his softness. We are going to smash Mr. Softee!!!@dmorey @BrooklynNets @JoelEmbiid With the right dedication, this feat is achievable. Wilt has slept with THOUSANDS Of woman estimating over 20,000. Wilt played 14 seasons and Joel is in his sixth. Assuming Joel plays around 8-9 more seasons, he will have to average 4 woman everyday a year to beat Wilt’s record!BIG BALL GAME TONIGHT. @BrooklynNets @ @sixers WHO U GOT ? 🏀@OfficialNBARefs @BrooklynNets @sixers @NBAonTNT I’m so sick and tired of watching these referees determine outcomes. Fans want to see players make plays to win games. Not referees!!! Do better NBA! The Hawks game last night was a prime example. Absolutely horrible job by that crew. There is no consistency in calls whatsoever.@dmorey @BrooklynNets @JoelEmbiid @dmorey most field goals in a game without a miss. He will do it tonightI like the @BrooklynNets somebody lock me in 🤝@dmorey @BrooklynNets @JoelEmbiid I think bedding 20K women may be out of reach.  I'm gonna go with most FG's made in a half (22).@dmorey @BrooklynNets @JoelEmbiid 50 Point Playoff games! And he’ll break it in 1 series if we play the Bucks in the playoffs 🔥 https://t.co/Fx9LyqwZxiI wanted a Kessler Edwards and Fresh Thrends Andre Drummond for me to complete my @BrooklynNets S3 team set.

 I dont ask for more. I always set my expectation within reach 😊

Pulling a rare or legendary will be a bonus.

It’s a very plausible record that he is on a good track to accomplish especially here while he’s still in his prime.@dmorey @BrooklynNets @JoelEmbiid I’d have him breaking Most consecutive 20-point games! Wilt had 126, and this season alone Embiid has only scored less than 20 points NINE times out of 52(!!) games played this season. With Harden out there this becomes very possible! Currently the streak is 7, just 120 to go!@dmorey @BrooklynNets @JoelEmbiid Definitely most free throws made in a game.

Embiid being the most unstoppable force in the league + lights out from the free throw line makes this one the most doable. #MVPiid@dmorey @BrooklynNets @JoelEmbiid Most 40pt game in a season is the most doable!!@dmorey @BrooklynNets @JoelEmbiid Chamberlain shot 61% on free throws in his record season, the highest percentage of his career. Joel Embiid has averaged 81.3 percent from the free-throw line this season.

BUT, he has 8 of the needed 20 point games to get to the 126 by the end of next year. so would end up with 26 this year, plus 20 in playoffs (let’s say. Avg is around 23 I think). 46 plus 82 is 128.

He will get 61@dmorey @BrooklynNets @JoelEmbiid Joel will complete what James nearly did.

Wilt led the league in FTA for 6 consecutive seasons.

James did it 5 times in a 6 year stretch (finished 2nd once).

By season’s end Joel will have done it back to back years &amp; he’ll continue to lead the league for 4-5 more seasons.@dmorey @BrooklynNets @JoelEmbiid Has to be the most consecutive 30 point games (65!). why?

Wilt never fouled out? I thought that might be the one at first because Joel isn’t usually in foul trouble. A testament to his incredible defense, but it seems he did 6 times in his career. So I’m going with most double doubles all time. Seems to be a regular thing for him.@dmorey @BrooklynNets @JoelEmbiid Th greatest Center in franchise history record.@dmorey @BrooklynNets @JoelEmbiid – Most consecutive seasons leading the NBA in free throw attempts@dmorey @BrooklynNets @JoelEmbiid Most free throws in a game. Joel Embiid can break Wilt's record of 28. He has a historically high free-throw rate and is an unusually great free throw shooter for a center. I really think this will happen in the next few years.@dmorey @BrooklynNets @JoelEmbiid Joel can definitely beat Most FTs in an All Star Game that Wilt currently holds at 16 https://t.co/MhxwRRyIds@dmorey @BrooklynNets @JoelEmbiid Most free throws made in a game@dmorey @BrooklynNets @JoelEmbiid Most consecutive seasons leading league in points per game🤌🏼@dmorey @BrooklynNets @JoelEmbiid most crotch chops in a season.Kyrie Irving is a magicien!!! 50 points en 19 tirs… what a pleasure to see him play basketball 🏀! #ILoveThisGame #KyrieIrving #BrooklynNets #NBA75          https://t.co/XB8okewWbb@dmorey @BrooklynNets @JoelEmbiid Most free throws made in a game.. jo can beat 28@dmorey @BrooklynNets @JoelEmbiid Most seasons leading the NBA in free throw attemptsWhen I become mayor of Brooklyn, I'm making "Juicy" by Biggie the Brooklyn Borough Anthem..

The second closest one imo is NBA playoff record – Most field goals in a seven-game series (113 vs. the St. Louis Hawks in 1964). In an endless scoring series vs the Suns in the finals.@dmorey @BrooklynNets @JoelEmbiid he’s going to break the record for…

The season averages of 23, 14 &amp; 6 seems reachable for Jokic too.@dmorey @BrooklynNets @JoelEmbiid Most consecutive 20 point games. JoJo could definitely do this one.@dmorey @BrooklynNets @JoelEmbiid NBA all star record for Free throw attempts in a game (16)@dmorey @BrooklynNets @JoelEmbiid Most titles won by a 76ers center@dmorey @BrooklynNets @JoelEmbiid Most consecutive seasons leading the league in PPG. starts this year 🤩@dmorey @BrooklynNets @JoelEmbiid Finals mvps@dmorey @BrooklynNets @JoelEmbiid Most tennis wins against team’s president of basketball operations@dmorey @BrooklynNets @JoelEmbiid He won't get the calls in a game in the playoffs, so he gets the points hard way instead cuz he's too damn good.

Sorry for cursing. https://t.co/aVYrN2M8hK@dmorey @BrooklynNets @JoelEmbiid I’d like to see @JoelEmbiid break Wilt’s record for most points in a playoff game. Seems attainable with the right first round opponent. Especially if their center fouls out early in an otherwise competitive game.@dmorey @BrooklynNets @JoelEmbiid Wilt Chamberlain didn’t actually exist so he’s already broken all of these@dmorey @BrooklynNets @JoelEmbiid He’s not going to break Wilt’s record of averaging 48.5 minutes played per game in 1963.@dmorey @BrooklynNets @JoelEmbiid Has to be most free throws in a game@dmorey @BrooklynNets @JoelEmbiid NBA record – Most seasons leading NBA in minutes played (8)

Joel is getting more durable as the years go on...@dmorey @BrooklynNets @JoelEmbiid Most consecutive 20 point games@dmorey @BrooklynNets @JoelEmbiid Most times a Sixers player is referred to as “Wilt” in a game. (Will require assists from @katetscott and @alaatweets)@dmorey @BrooklynNets @JoelEmbiid Clearly.... NBA record – Most Free Throws Made in a Game (28 vs. the New York Knicks on March 2, 1962

But since plenty of other people have guessed this, as a tie breaker I say he'll do it in the playoffs@dmorey @BrooklynNets @JoelEmbiid Most consecutive games not fouling out since he’s the one fouling other players out.@dmorey @BrooklynNets @JoelEmbiid Most tennis wins with some scrub https://t.co/F7OLAsTmDv@dmorey @BrooklynNets @JoelEmbiid Free Throws Made.@dmorey @BrooklynNets @JoelEmbiid Definitely FT points made in a single game.
Also, the amount of points scored in a half isn't out of reach. Embiid did score 50 points in 27 minutes this season.
But geez Wilt's achievements are insane, are we sure he existed@dmorey @mike_greger @BrooklynNets @JoelEmbiid NBA record – Most Free Throws Made in a Game (28 vs. the New York Knicks on March 2, 1962)

This seems to be the most likely imo.Words of wisdom from our guys🗣

He can 127 with the Embiid/harden duo and he averages half that from the FT line.@dmorey @BrooklynNets @JoelEmbiid Most games in a row leading team in scoring@dmorey @BrooklynNets @JoelEmbiid Most free throws made in a game! @dmorey @joelembiid @BrooklynNets@dmorey @BrooklynNets @JoelEmbiid Most FTs made in a game (28) AND most seasons led in free throws attempted (9).
