#NBA #gambling #innovation #blockchainNot sure why Sacramento sports media feels the need to tell us when former Kings have standout nights for other teams. If they're not playing for the Kings, I simply don't care. #onemanfocusgroupThe biggest thing for the Sacramento Kings is to keep the momentum from the win over the Spurs, in San Antonio. "A lot of good things came from our defense", De'Aaron Fox said and the Kings have to build on their 48-mins effort.

📺 NBA League Pass, @vamos 

#SacramentoProud https://t.co/sucbQelFP9@MarkJonesESPN @SacramentoKings What about the night before?After a full day off.Against a mediocre Pelicans team they should beat or at least make a close game of it?They lost by 30 F..ing points.That was way more unimpressive.They need a real coach and a veteran vocal leader!HB is good but boring!@newsbabe1530 @menasaysso @comstocksmag I noticed an updated one the other day that has @SacramentoKings branding@gwiss Still hoping he comes back "home" to Sacramento. Would love to see him on a winning Kings team.. assuming we can ever be a winning team lmaooo@GeraldTracy6 @MrKenRudulphTV @SacramentoKings oh wait so it was you who did it hahaha@MrSatanHercule @dallasmavs @AACenter @SacramentoKings Damn I don’t know but I’m downIf you’re @SacramentoKings fan go check out @TopShotKingdom https://t.co/abdfbLsKSnMARVIN BAGLEY HAS ALWAYS HAD TALENT AND THE SACRAMENTO KINGS JUST DONT KNOW WHAT THEYRE DOINGOne last note: as easy as it is to make fun of Sacramento, not knowing how to use Bagley wasn't exclusively a Kings problem. 

Coach K had him playing the 3 at Duke sometimes alongside Wendell Carter and Javin DeLaurier, which was just mindboggling.I’ll die on this hill: it’s insane that the league blackballed this man because he beefed with the Sacramento Kings https://t.co/owvxUFFhDR@yngthw I've been a #SacramentoKings fan for almost 40 years. I think you can figure out my answer to that question!😉🤦‍♀️😢Bought a @boogiecousins jersey today.  hopefully I can get it signed on Wednesday in Sacramento! Hopefully this paid off anyone knows when shootaround  starts? Literally dude is my all time favorite kings players!#sacramentokings #nba #kings@SacramentoKings Where is it going@i22a11 @nsitto2 @SacramentoKings There’s been plenty of players who have shit the bed ever since leaving Sac. Don’t start this.@i22a11 @nsitto2 @SacramentoKings Yeah because Willie Cauley-Stein, Thomasin Robinson, Ben McLemore, and Nik Stauskas have gone on to have extremely successful careers@kennythomasnba @SacramentoKings @NBCSKings Why is Bibby wearing the #45 Jazz jersey?  Weird!!!@nsitto2 @SacramentoKings Oh Nick. Don’t fall for this. Call us in 3 years. Rooting for Bags, but he can’t stay on the floor.

Idc about whatever clutch shot he’ll hit randomly against the OKC thunder or sudden 25-30 pt game against the Sacramento Kings..@RockNSportsGREG It’s a great system.

https://t.co/6iu0zpkKr7Shoutout @josh_j11 from the Sacramento Kings for shopping with us while in town for tomorrow’s game! 🏀🤝 @ SOLEPLIER https://t.co/3I84tVFf8oUmoja ARC at the Sacramento Kings Golden 1 Center on HBCU night February 24,2021 https://t.co/fNxsvuHjaz@ashnaguliani Sacramento is very supportive of their teams. 
The rivercats and the republic draw well. 
They support the kings. 
They'd certainly support women's soccer.
They had a new stadium in place, and had the 2022 and 23 ncaa championships lined up there. 
Ugh...@rbritoreis @statmuse @nemi1599 @SacramentoKings They are hidding him for the POELTL GAME.@SacramentoKings Actually winning a game@8baleadas @QueTeImportaLM Lol I did very well on Wednesday. But I also have no feelings towards Sacramento kings players.
