Did you call the Utah Jazz in 97-98 “ancient?”

They had 3 HoF players (two in the top 10 at their position all time), the 2012 DPOY and a top 10 6th man all time. Plus Carlisle, Casey and Stottson the staff. 

18-3. Why didn’t anyone else beat them?@JAZZMANTYLER @utahjazz Pretty sure my wife just found it just on Amazon or Etsy. It’s been a long time since we bought it 😂@tj_morrison714 @utahjazz That's amazing! 😍Utah jazz will nearly kill the lakers tomorrow!

@utahjazz ?@SpencerKeele @utahjazz Ok that’s not fair though. Name a starter from the jazz that has gone on to be better or on a championship team. The names are very few. And without Quinn the jazz wouldn’t be a good team. And chances are Donovan leaves at the end of his contract.🔒 lock of the day

Brilliant!@utahjazz I'm hoping that these players have been watching the games and come back with a "WIN" attitude.  I  always wondered why the Coach only played the same 8 players. Leaving the rest unconditioned to play. sense /senseless. Point/Pointless. Hope/Hopeless. (Rick Carlyle).@utahjazz @Qualtrics Donovan is shooting 33.7% that means for every 99 shots Donovan makes 35. That's a good celebration ? The Jazz have lost the last 4 games. (in a row)  "Records" are made to be broken.Two young superstars! Who will win the league MVP first? 🤔👇

🕷️ Mitchell or Tatum ☘️

Heat or Knicks?

The Utah Jazz are 1st in the NBA, in most made triples, at 15.0 PG.

Something tells me it would work for Utah...@TheZane1315 @utahjazz @Qualtrics Yep, Mitchell is taking over 38% of this shots from 3, Stockton shot less than 17% of his shots from long range.  Mitchell also takes nearly twice as many shots per game as Stockton did, so....@utahjazz We should rename that 2 jos crocs overThe Lakers play the Utah Jazz on Monday night as tip off begins at 10:30 p.m.NBA 1/16 OVERNIGHT PLAY

Playoff outcome will prove if that’s true or not.@SLAMonline @utahjazz @BucketsONeale00 Congrats Bucket's O'NealeOn this day in 1991, John Stockton of the Utah Jazz dished out 28 assists in a 124-102 win over the San Antonio SpursAnswer: Gilbert Arenas ties the Verizon Center scoring record with 51 points, including a game-winning 3-point shoot, to beat the Utah Jazz 114-111. https://t.co/sGlHXD5Lbs@KingJosiah54 Not sure but Mac Jones woulda been on the Utah Jazz somehow.In his 5th season, Donovan Mitchell has a better team around him than the Blazers have ever put around Damian Lillard in 10 seasons.

The @utahjazz front office is elite.The Utah Jazz are participating the the NBA's HBCU Fellowship program!

#PracticeInterviews | @ZionsBank@BensHoops @utahjazz All I can think is… Rudy is coming back versus the Nuggets. The only team the Jazz beat on the road without him. So… in typical Jazz fashion, I’m sure they will lose now that he’s back..Game tomorrow.
