I'd watch a random Nascar race or a Boston Celtics preseason game over game 7 of the WS.@TA1297 Noted team no one hates: the Boston Celtics lmfao1-1 after two meetings this season, the championship favorite Orlando Magic (1-6) square off against the plucky, up and coming Boston Celtics (2-5) to see who can get the upper hand in a true battle of the titans tomorrow.

#TheLastShot #NBA https://t.co/iqtoknjTEh@paraaand Real Boston Celtics hoursNothing drives me crazier than watching a deep bench not being utilized. #BostonCeltics Horford playing a lot of minutes, meanwhile we have Bruno Fernando, Enes Kanter who nearly averaged or did average a double double last season, and Hernangomez just watching from the bench.For real, my life might be better than I‚Äôve ever been. Like, the ONLY thing that sucks right now is the play of the Boston Celtics.Boston Celtics NEW ERA 59FIFTY Hat Green/Black
