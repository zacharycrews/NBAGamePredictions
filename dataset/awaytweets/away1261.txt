If Lebron did it we would be all over it and im not Bron fan at all but they sit at the same table Talent wise so hes judged also@TatumXSpence @anthonypic_999 @celtics That picture means nothing every site automatically says that@micky_wg @celtics CELTICS 4-0@NJtoBKLYN @RatiodbyBando @patty_nasty @celtics @jaytatum0 @dtheis10 @FCHWPO @Al_Horford @Grant2Will @paytonpritch3 @PutnamToday Remember when it was Nets in 4?

So gotta wait till tomorrow, just to make sure he feels ok and doesn't have a set back.

I don’t think you’re going to give lots of good examples of players who are 100% ready to return but come back getting their full allotment of starter minutes right away. It’s more about game shape and game speed than condition of the injury easing back in.@taylorcsnow @celtics He’s so excited lol oh cheesin ass 🫠@AdamMKaufman The Basketball Gods have no mercy!

These students volunteered their time to raise money for #PCRFKids at a @Celtics game. Thank you, @TerrierLacrosse and @TerrierMLAX!🥍🌟

#NationalVolunteerWeek https://t.co/ejrnZq7Bih@brraaanndon @JoeHinds35 Can jaylen brown carry a team? Entire Boston Celtics team was bad this year until they went on that crazy run. Lavine literally scored 28ppg on 50/40/90 last year and this year he’s been injured and he’s still efficient. These 6 are all second options on a team tho.Jaylen Brown led the @celtics in scoring as the C's take a 2-0 series lead, while protecting home court at the same time.

The Celtics-Nets series continues tomorrow night at 7:30 PM (ET) on @ESPNNBA.
