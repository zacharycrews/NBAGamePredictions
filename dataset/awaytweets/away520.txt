As far as I’m concerned Plankton Antetofraudpo only has mickey mouse rings 🐭🐭🐭🐭@BlkholeAllst3rs @TheNBACentral @AhnFireDigital The Heat did him dirty both by trading him in the first place since Miami loved him so much and by trading him to the Raps instead of the Mavs a place he wanted to go to in the first place. 

It has nothing to do with his contract.Check out 2014-15 NBA Prestige Miami Heat Luol Deng Trading Card #MiamiHeat https://t.co/b6futoYzqP via @eBay #NBA75 #NBATwitter #NBAonTNT #NewYear2022I’m watching NBA Basketball (Washington Wizards at Miami Heat) on the DVR.
