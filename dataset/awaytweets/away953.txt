Raptors are 7th in the East but are struggling without VanVleet and Anunoby. Orlando sets the missed games standard though, so zero sympathy from us. Magic have a tougher game in Memphis tomorrow.Atlanta Hawks ML Winner

We need Phoenix -6 tonight to go 3-1 and make a profit. @tonytwobets @thetoyman1 @LaroSos1Raptors lose yet again, this time to Orlando.

Still, Pacers should be much better.@SeansFoxplays @WashWizards @kylekuzma @Raptors @OrlandoMagic @NBA @PicksCity yesterday's rematchThis must explain why the Raptors are down 15 to the freaking Orlando Magic.
