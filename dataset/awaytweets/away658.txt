"He's a really good player. He came in ready and can do it all. He can score the ball. He can play make, defend. So, the sky's the limit for him. He's a good young player."Here's the big reason why the Detroit Pistons are in their worst three-year run since 1978-81 ... which of course led to the drafting of Isiah Lord Thomas III.
