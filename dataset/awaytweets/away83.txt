YOUR @MiamiHEAT starters against Memphis:

🔥Kyle Lowry

🔥P.J. Tucker
🔥Dewayne Dedmon@TheMiamiHeatUK @MiamiHEAT Happy birthday! https://t.co/UvdNHn2U3o@clxete @JimmysBurner5 @MiamiHEAT Duncan creates spacing needed on the floor for the starting unit. Even if he’s not starting, he’s opening the floor up for butler, bam and the others to get easy buckets.@MiamiHEAT Yurtseven off the bench 😍And that’s why I’m a @MiamiHEAT fan ALL day https://t.co/qh4wNF2eC9@clxete @JimmysBurner5 @MiamiHEAT You are right but there is a reason why he’s on the bench. It gives us depth. They can have allot more talent allot more of the time if herro is on the bench. You need points coming off the bench.@DiehardDerrick @Nickheat3 @MiamiHEAT Love that pfp@clxete @MiamiHEAT There’s a reason why he doesn’t start, he’s instant offense. He wouldn’t get the shots he gets now if he started. The team is more balanced this way.@MiamiHEAT Guys this happend when you approach reg szn like post szn gms. I know you got swept last szn and you wanna denonstrate that you better than that but keep it easy eitherwise you may not finish the reg szn healthy.#MIAvsMEM

Lamelo is now listed at the top of the opponent’s scouting reports; The Miami game was the best illustration to date. How did JB adjust when the Heat executed their plan?

The Panthers began in 1993, moved to a brand new arena in 1998. Heat left at the end of the 1999 calendar year for a new arena. uMiami hoops moved out in 2002.

Arena imploded in 2008.@305ontherisee @arthurz_11 @MarquisNBA @statmuse @MiamiHEAT @JimmyButler you’re joking rightThe Miami Heat have the NBA’s best defensive rating.

Opponents are averaging about 94.0 points per game against them (best defense since the 80’s, best in nba currently)

While allowing 39.1 opponent fg percentage (1st in NBA)

Y’all should be terrified https://t.co/Q8KH1zv0DmThe @MiamiHEAT went a perfect 19-of-19 from the FT line last night vs. CHA, marking the 4th game in team history that they were perfect from the charity stripe with at least 19 attempts per HEAT game notes @5OTF_@MarquisNBA @statmuse @MiamiHEAT @JimmyButler Played the Nets and Bucks lmao
These kids man😂😂🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️Miami outrebounded the Hornets last night by +23 (60-37), marking the second-largest rebound margin against Charlotte in team history.

Miami opens the season playing on each of the 1st 8 Saturdays, w/ 6 of those 8 on the road. 

There’s only 7 Saturdays during the ENTIRE season that MIA will not play per HEAT game notes. @5OTF_@MiamiHEAT @Bam1of1 One banner up, many more to go…@MiamiHEAT Cringe + fell offIt’s early days but the #MiamiHeat are restricting teams and making it hard to score with some hard-nosed defense.

#GamblingTwitter https://t.co/R4Op9TrFxXThe Miami Heat have started the season 5-0 in the Both Teams to Score 100+ Points market if you selected NO in each game. A $100 bet on the NO selection in all of their games would have returned profits of +$1,028 👀📈

Well, let me extend this claim, Heat will be 8-2 by 10 games.

@MiamiHEAT@HeatvsHaters @MiamiHEAT Give Herro his due.  He played warden part-time on LeMelo Ball.Now everybody saying Miami Heat are genius for choosing Herro over Harden bc of these new rules...

There was never a Herro for Harden trade! If it was that simple Miami would've probably done it.

But we'll take the compliment.@MiamiHEAT Best defense in the league2021 has been a pretty good sports year for me so far. 
Cruz Azul, my mexican soccer team won the championship for the first time in over 23 years. 
SF Giants didn’t win but they have a good future imo.

Miami just playing at a different level when it comes to defending, physicality and rebounding@GregSylvander @MiamiHEAT @5ReasonsSports @5OTF_ I’m trying to think of any team that could win 4 of 7 games against this team…. There are noneTyler Herro going crazyyy this year. Need Lowry to start putting up more points before all the Heat fans come for his neck. Had he still been in Toronto all the news media outlets would be ripping. But in Miami they finally give him the "he does the intangibles"Y’all been saying all these other teams gonna be dangerous. Why y’all no talk about the Miami Heat???Miami Heat defense is eliteMiami Heat BBL trio in full action tonight😈Is it me or are these @hornets vs. @MiamiHEAT refs absolutely terrible for both sides?I love the swagger of this Miami Heat teamI want Miami heat rolls from sushi saki😫@MiamiHEAT are going to the finals! 

Book it!Dominant 1st half! 🔥🔥🔥 @MiamiHEAT #HeatCultureHalftime: Heat 64, Hornets 46

Tyler Herro leads Miami with 18 points, 2 rebounds, and 4 assists.

The Heat are shooting 47% from the field with 9 turnovers.I’ve watched every Heat team play defense since 1991. 

Through these first 4.5 games, this is as good a @MiamiHEAT defense as I’ve watched. Ever. 

I know it’s only 4.5 games. And we still have a 2nd half to play.

But wow.
