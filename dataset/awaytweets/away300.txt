Jrue wore down Booker too when given the assignment.

Do not discredit the Bucks. Don’t even consider it.@TexanExiled @ChrisAmidzich @Bucks Doesn't mean you cant get it or pass it along@Jumpshot8 @Suns @Bucks No one is taking the Suns lightly or disrespecting The Suns. The Warriors are more of a story right now because no one expected them to play this well this year. The West Champs who went to a game 7 in the finals doing well is the dog-bites-man story. You’re creating this story.@lexnoggle @Bucks Good morning6 games winning streak

#DailyTribune@Bucks Sweeeet. !!!@Bucks Wonderful. More of this please.@Bucks I kinda want to meet giannis for my birthday too.@On4Nothing @Ikeyburner @iamcoachrich Does it pass the TRUTH TEST ?
Milwaukee Bucks knew that Giannis Atentekumpo and Khris Middleton were not enough. They chose Bogdan Bogdanovich = ILLEGAL TRADE.
They tried again for that #3 with Jrue Holiday = LEGAL TRADE.@EBrooksUncut @Bucks Glad you support anti Wisconsin organizations@Robingnj @Bucks Don't know who has the most trade value now

LeBron is 37 next month
KD and Steph are 33
Giannis can't shoot
Luka can't win a playoff series
Kawhi and Embiid can't stay healthy
Trae and Dame are too undersized
You wouldn't bet your life on Jokic or Zion having long careers@KyleSchroederWI @Bucks Good thing my tax dollars don’t go to the University of Minnesota@EBrooksUncut @Bucks U of Minnesota does the same thing but even worse. Keep acting like you’re superior for some reason? #Pathetic@KyleSchroederWI @Bucks Keep cheering for the taxpayer funded team that funnels proceeds to Dem organizations@Bucks Man is the best@overtime @Giannis_An34 @Bucks you love to see it 😁@EBrooksUncut hates when Wisconsin’s home team @Bucks wins the world championship. But clowns our great state when the evil people of Minnesota win their national championship Against us@Robingnj @Bucks Just trolling@Christo55765257 @Bucks Is your goal to ruin a nice moment?@Such @ReignOfApril @NBA @nuggets @Bucks Just a smidge2021 @NBA MVP Nikola Jokic is just a few inches taller than I am 😅🙃 honor singing the anthem for the #Denver @Nuggets vs @Bucks game 🙌🏾 https://t.co/XJFzzTfSuw@Bucks Love it!@clintonyates And as an addendum, I sat next to several Suns fans when I traveled to Milwaukee for the Finals and they were great to chat with. Bucks/Suns fans are similar in that our teams haven't done much in decades and we were just happy to be angling for a title.@Bucks That kid is no longer a nuggets fan.Lil asian thang says I prolly got a long dick 😂 you better be good at driving shoutout Milwaukee bucks cause you better be careful@Bucks Grab  pen and sign themMilwaukee Bucks @ Indiana Pacers

About showing kindness though@Bucks Would he distance himself from him in the last minute of a close game the way he does a basketball?Watching College Football &amp; the NFL is as predictable as watching the same movie in theaters for the 7th time. It’s the same shit, just a different day. Thank god for College Hoops and the @Bucks.@Swanee54 @Bucks @Giannis_An34 He is the goat on and off the court@Bucks 🥰 awesome!!Wisconsin sports underachieves as per usual.

How wonderful!@Ikeyburner @On4Nothing @iamcoachrich Milwaukee Bucks got caught cheating. 😀😀😀 Made an illegal trade for Bogdanovich, rebounded by making a legal trade for the best 2-Way Player in the NBA Jrue Holiday.
