Milwaukee Bucks knew that Giannis Atentekumpo and Khris Middleton were not enough. They chose Bogdan Bogdanovich = ILLEGAL TRADE.
They tried again for that #3 with Jrue Holiday = LEGAL TRADE.@EBrooksUncut @Bucks Glad you support anti Wisconsin organizations@Robingnj @Bucks Don't know who has the most trade value now

LeBron is 37 next month
KD and Steph are 33
Giannis can't shoot
Luka can't win a playoff series
Kawhi and Embiid can't stay healthy
Trae and Dame are too undersized
