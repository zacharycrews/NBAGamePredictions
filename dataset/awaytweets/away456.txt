#PorVida #NBA #NBATwitter #NBA75@thehalestone Eh idk. We saw demar in San Antonio for three years and it just wasn‚Äôt a good fit. Demar is doing better with increased spacing around him in Chicago. The floor was too tight for him here.

on the flipside, spurs D is better and more growth for young guys.Utah Jazz - Charlotte Hornets
Golden State Warriors - Sacramento Kings

#TheGamePlan@JackSchkope3 you mean san antonio spurs? eitherway i would felt equally insultedüò≠Spurs lost today got me thinking about how San Antonio lost a chance at a MLS team &amp; the AAF team folded.

The WNBA &amp; minor league hockey team moved to Las Vegas.

Spurs gotta stay in SA.#Spurs @ #Kings

This game had that vibe even before tip. Haliburton and Hield were lava-hot and then Damian Jones got cooking off the bench and it just sorta snowballed on San Antonio.

With a bunch of Kings in H&amp;S, you can start Hali, Hield, Barnes and probably Metu.Married to the game üéôüé§üåü
