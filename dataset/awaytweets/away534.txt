Cole Anthony looks like a legit 3 level scorer whose pull up shooting really adds a dynamic we have been missing from a pg since Jameer Nelson. He is always ready for the big moment and also is good at making simple passes due to his gravity.@HotTakesB_ball @OrlandoMagic ...KD,Irving they just had to be decent and Knicks had to be one of the worst organizations in the NBA for like 20 years. So if you want to compare Nets to Magic then more accurate now would be Nets in 18/19 but both teams would bo get there keeping thier "old stars"@HotTakesB_ball @OrlandoMagic The difference we tried to build this team with Vuc as our first option, he is now a 3rd option and this is totally different. Nets example is stupid, they dud blow their entire team, they did not try to build around Lopez and bring him a better player or two.
