Nasty loss yesterday from the sixers. This is the last road game on a 6 game road trip for the mavericks against a very average team that gives up alot of points and rebounds. Luka will come out gunning, and we may be in for a blowout.

GG, you guys will be a tough out in the West, you're a fun team to watch. 

There's maybe 3 centers who even match up decently with Jojo, so Mavs shouldn't punish themselves too much on this point.@TheMissesSmith @dick_nowitzki @dallasmavs @Chime Lmao https://t.co/EJYGRScfMB@ryan_mckenna15 @dallasmavs @Chime Sure, I’m unhappy because we lost but I’m just saying it won’t be the same in the playoffs. Luka felt that last year against the Clips. If a series is physical and competitive they are going to let you play. Harden is going to be more affected than Embiid, Joel is a beast.@ryan_mckenna15 @dallasmavs @Chime Wait what? Maxey? Top 5 pg?@Dverxs @dallasmavs @Chime Who you missing lol?
