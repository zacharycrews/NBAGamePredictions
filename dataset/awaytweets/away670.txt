With the understanding that Grant is 27, under contract for one more season, and Detroit is not under real pressure to trade him.@VeskiTeo @Decievxd @KOT4Q I actually would disagree. I just feel he don‚Äôt try wit the pistons, he knew his fate after a quarter into his Detroit contract he hated it there@DetroitPistons @CadeCunningham_ @Keith_Langlois wow shocking analyze@Therran @DetroitPistons @Therran did you watch their game last night?  Whatever they are doing isn‚Äôt working and blowing it up can‚Äôt hurt :).  Keep Cade, Stewart, and get rid of everything else 
Sorry @matt5175Yesterday reports stated that the Sixers rebuffed a big trade offer that they got for Simmons from the Detroit Pistons. The Sixers were not thrilled with the offer. It didn‚Äôt fit into their superstar partner plan for team big man Joel Embiid. https://t.co/ialvSHZcNv@DetroitPistons @CadeCunningham_ @Keith_Langlois Yet we give cojo more touchesThe #Pistons identified @CadeCunningham_ not because he could run faster or jump higher than everybody else in a prospect-loaded draft but because of his otherworldly feel for the game.
