#NBA75 https://t.co/kkHRYz6V70@BrooklynNets why was Blake Griffin not on the floor in 4th https://t.co/ujY43ikIOj Houston? So needed his experience &amp; great rebounding!https://t.co/YdV7jPEvy5 
🏀Brooklyn Nets have the team to win. By pulling the best players on the floor. Harden 1, Mills or Harris 2, Durant 3, Griffin 4, Aldridge 5,and Millsap backing up 4,5. Using their bench players.@BrooklynNets can the Nets survive these useless losses🧐 it appears the Nets just play LAZY defense for 3 1/2 Qtrs. &amp; then try to barely pull out a win😳Failed with the Bulls &amp; then with the Rockets,who are a team below 500🙈not looking as a elite in the east! SAD🥵@MickFlairDrip @BrooklynNets Happy birthday bro! Hope you get to enjoy all the beer your heart desires.

I wonder if @KingJames will join the @BrooklynNets or @Suns or go back to @cavs or @MiamiHEAT@_bigjayy_ Forever Brooklyn Net@SASBurnerAcct SAS does have the option of ignoring the Knicks for awhile while he pays attention to the Brooklyn Nets. There's nothing wrong with paying more attention to an interesting team while an underachieving team does so with relatively little attention.I’ve been watching NBA Basketball (Brooklyn Nets at Houston Rockets) on the DVR.

Must be that yankees education system at work lmao 

You compared Allen Iverson playing fir the Brooklyn Nets now vs. James Harden playing for the Nets now.@WesleyJafar @cthulhu3430 @AASpark27 @BrooklynNets Yes you did. Yes, you did say that which is a COMPARISON. The answer is no because 1 has been retired for a decade and won the MVP 29 year ago while the other won it 3 years ago and is in his prime.@BrooklynNets @JoinDrop Nice 👌👌👌👌👌👍🙂If @KingJames’ @Lakers were faced with a similar situation, the @NBA and Adam Silver would damn sure find a way to alter the schedule. Probably do the same for @warriors and @BrooklynNets. Make it right, Association. #BullsNation #SeeRed #NBA #NBATwitter https://t.co/DxI0E8x1cJ
