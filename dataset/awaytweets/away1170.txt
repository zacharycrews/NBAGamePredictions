But our coach likes to play the half-court game, and that's why we have are at the last place when it comes to pace in the NBA.

Young players like to run, but Thibs doesn't, and that's why he prefers vets over young players.

I hope we get a new coach, a young one.@Iskandr_Zulqar9 @nyknicks They have a good young core - Garland, Mobley, Allen, Markinnen, Sexton, Okoro, etc - and they have a good young coah in JB Bickerstaff.

My Knicks also have a good young core - RJ, Obi, IQ, Mitch, Cam, Grimes, Deuce, etc - but we have an old school coach in Thibs who like vets.@nyknicks @23savage____ Mitch is about to break his season FG% record this season.

Yes, he declined the $9M player option (they also never made him an offer…they drafted Zion days before) &amp; got himself a raise from the desperate Knicks for $20M per year.

He did nobody any favors but himself.The Cleveland Cavaliers use a balanced offensive attack led by Darius Garland to beat the New York Knicks at Madison Square Garden. https://t.co/ZKBJFmxG9e@EfdotStudio @NBA @nyknicks @TheGarden congrats, can't wait to see what you cook upNew York #Knicks: What a dime by @immanuelquickley__ ...

Reed scored 36 points as well.
