Just thought I'd reach out so you can help me see what you see.@Don_Strokesss @HoopSpaces Alex Caruso was a free agent. 😂😂😂
Free agency is unpredictable.
Washington Wizards trade is what sabotaged the Lakers season, not the loss of Caruso.
Should have traded for a SHARPSHOOTER and kept Markieff Morris for Small-Ball Center. https://t.co/ByphWKcixaThe Washington Wizards still lack a vision – The Washington Post https://t.co/sJaj8DmPQtCharlotte Hornets - Washington Wizards

That tells you they regret that Washington Wizards trade now. Lebron is going to be the point guard for all 4th Quarters.The wizards should go back to the bullets that names is so much better…
