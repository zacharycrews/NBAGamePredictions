Cavs are easily the best coached of the 3 but they have 0 depth, Hornets have the talent but they play zero D and they're sloppy, and the Hawks caught that injury bug bad, but they have the most playoff exp.The @hornets have been winning a TON lately! @MELOD1P is a big reason why.

So why is his #NBA2K22 rating dropping then?
