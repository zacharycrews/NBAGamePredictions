He literally said he was prepared to sit out the season if he wasn't traded.  And then said he never said he didn't want to or wasn't going to play for Grizz.  Bro, that's literally what "prepared to sit out" means lol.  Salty ass bumAndre Igoudala uses @ShamsCharania to slander the @memgrizz. Then says some shit about the "wealthy" controlling the media.

This is what happens when you fall off. Lebron been getting the same treatment all year. You aren’t special, just washed@DurChokeTornACL @HonestABFan @honestGSWfan @memgrizz Sad, we couldn’t beat you with an injured g league team@DurChokeTornACL @honestGSWfan @memgrizz Ring check@whosJohnObrien @bayareafan34 @DogSurfRoadshow @memgrizz @warriors It's wild they think they're special  🤣🤣 the grizzlies treat every win the same bc it's actually fun for them. It's weird being a grizzlies fan with all this new hate lmao@DogSurfRoadshow @memgrizz @warriors Poking a sleeping bear? KD isn’t there anymore. Nobody is afraid a limping klay and washed green. We already know Steph can’t do it alone@_illmatic22 @BleacherReport @memgrizz How many giant water bottles does Z own lol. He has a different one every day@bayareafan34 @The_Great_Rae @DogSurfRoadshow @memgrizz @warriors Doesn’t matter. They ain’t won in 5 going on 6 years. This why you don’t build super teams!! You destroy your youth and bench depth@memgrizz @dillonbrooks24 @Verizon DB told Wiggins: I got your whole playbook buddy lol@BleacherReport @memgrizz He looks like a combination of Steven Adams and Kyle Anderson@DogSurfRoadshow @memgrizz @warriors Yo goofy ass acting like we wouldn’t take them serious in the playoffs. We’re a young team so these the steps we gotta take, every game matters to a certain degree.@bayareafan34 @The_Great_Rae @DogSurfRoadshow @memgrizz @warriors What does a fan of a team got to do with know what a dynasty is? 💀 you lame@bayareafan34 @whosJohnObrien @DogSurfRoadshow @memgrizz @warriors Who said it wasn't but yall were sorry for a very long time with no  chips no where near the number lakers or Celtics have also. My point was jaren wasn't even talking shit so why so much animosity in his comments?  Lol why yall even care so much??@The_Great_Rae @bayareafan34 @DogSurfRoadshow @memgrizz @warriors They hate to see young dudes succeed! They think cause they favorite player/team ain’t doing well they gotta hate on the others!@whosJohnObrien @The_Great_Rae @DogSurfRoadshow @memgrizz @warriors Once all the players from those teams are gone bragging about them will be meaningless@memgrizz @warriors how many rings yall have@whosJohnObrien @The_Great_Rae @DogSurfRoadshow @memgrizz @warriors Bros a grizzlies fan tryna talk to me about what a dynasty is 💀@memgrizz When playoff tickets go on sale?@bayareafan34 @The_Great_Rae @DogSurfRoadshow @memgrizz @warriors Not just brag about winning 3 rings in 5 years, FIVE years ago. Cmon dawg. Last ring they won was 2017. It’s 2022 about to go into the 2022-2023 season soon.@GrizzliesPR @memgrizz @spurs We only need one win to clinch the 2 seed so I’d rest Ja, and Jaren til the playoffs. Maybe even bane but he’ll be fine. Dillon can use the next few games to get back to 100%@bayareafan34 @The_Great_Rae @DogSurfRoadshow @memgrizz @warriors Compared to Boston and LA they babies. That’s the point you missing. If they real dynasties they should be able to win more and more championships@whosJohnObrien @bayareafan34 @DogSurfRoadshow @memgrizz @warriors Right!  Pressed for no reason. Why are they even in jarens mentions he wasn't even talking shit just congratulating his teammates 🤦🏾‍♀️@whosJohnObrien @The_Great_Rae @DogSurfRoadshow @memgrizz @warriors Uh winning 3 years in a 5 year span is a dynasty…@memgrizz what’s gooooood🥴🥴🥴 https://t.co/Gf23IfQqus@KsBloodstage @memgrizz I don’t think that tbh idk why your still replying go do something with your life plz@The_Great_Rae @bayareafan34 @DogSurfRoadshow @memgrizz @warriors Exactly! Warriors just got relevant within the last 10 yrs and they talking like they real dynasties like LA or Boston lol@whosJohnObrien @bayareafan34 @DogSurfRoadshow @memgrizz @warriors Every time we beat them they bring up rings they've won when more than half our current players weren't even in the league. Like they forgot how sorry the warriors once were 🤣@memphisjmusic @memgrizz It would be fun to see them battle in the Western Conference finals.Dear @memgrizz, since y’all cleared to play in the playoffs just please give the W to the spurs tomorrow.The #Lakers are such a massive disappointment. Gonna have to root for my #2 team, the @memgrizz the rest of the season. #LakersNationIm a die hard .@memgrizz fan tomorrow night…@FreeMumia17 @memgrizz we will see.@bigguwala @memgrizz They aint prove nothing@lilindiann_ @memgrizz Regular season dont matter lol@HollywoodBigRed @Rocsi67340795 @Bigdawg44735892 @BallySportsSO @JaMorant @memgrizz @thefishnation @ChrisVernonShow Aye man the game ain’t fair 🤷🏾‍♂️😂@ArcticString @DogSurfRoadshow @memgrizz @warriors The simple fact is is it’s rare to have a team so good that even when you lose arguably your best player you don’t miss a whole lot offensive and defensive capability. So we’re very lucky having such a deep squad.@ArcticString @DogSurfRoadshow @memgrizz @warriors Honestly with a guy like Ja you’re going to need his ability to do uncommon things especially in the playoffs when it gets tough and slow running. This is one of the few times where people act like having a deep team is a bad thing.@ArcticString @DogSurfRoadshow @memgrizz @warriors I honestly think it’s because we’re a relatively small market so people see us as upstarts. And that bias will not allow them to look past that. It was astounding how malicious Iguodala was when we got him but warriors fans make him out to be a victim@ArcticString @DogSurfRoadshow @memgrizz @warriors Very true@CChandlerTV @memgrizz So good seeing your sweet momma last night! You did wonderfully!@DetroitPistons just look at @memgrizz blueprint.I think I’m gonna save for a Steven Adams jersey. The most bleu collar hard working player that just truly understands his job! @memgrizz hit the nail on the head with that pickup@BleacherReport Comparison of number of NBA Championships won for both teams:

Golden State Warriors: 6

Memphis Grizzlies: 0@DogSurfRoadshow @memgrizz @warriors What I read was this: Those damn whippersnappers! &lt;as you violently shake your fist in the air.&gt;@JalenRose might be on to something. Zion to the @memgrizz ?!I don’t understand the Memphis Grizzlies hate. They want the 2nd youngest team, with the second best-record in the NBA to be silent and shy??? 

They just don’t like seeing young players win. https://t.co/iG9H4CaF5d@flying_skate @GrizzliesPR @memgrizz Yes, fans lost interest when the talk of relocation started  . I was a season ticket holder the entire time. It was painful at times but it was fun having the NBA in Van . Maybe one day the NBA will return🙏@Heatbagger @GrizzliesPR @memgrizz After the 1998-99 season lockout, attendance started to decline and John McCaw started to lose money and ended up selling the team. I unfortunately never got to see them play here in Vancouver.#YMF3SomePod NBA Power Rankings:

#NBA #Suns #Celtics #Grizzlies #Bucks #Heat #NBA75@flying_skate @GrizzliesPR @memgrizz Yes. Attendance wasn’t the issue, thats a myth . The Grizz were very well supported for how bad they were. Their biggest problem was the 60 cent Canadian dollar and the owners losing large piles of money .@reesedrcp1 @memgrizz Give me healthy Steph and GSW@Heatbagger @GrizzliesPR @memgrizz Absolutely. The Grizzlies last season in Vancouver had a higher attendance rate than what the Hornets, Hawks, Pelicans, Thunder, Kings and Memphis Grizzlies all currently have combined. It’s crazy why the NBA doesn’t relocate those teams.@joshweichman We must use this account to spread the gospel of Memphis Grizzlies basketballThe shirt handed @warriors (48-28) fall to the @memgrizz 123-95. Poole scored a game high 25pts for #dubnation.@ArcticString @DogSurfRoadshow @memgrizz @warriors Exactly. They act like before they started winning championships. That people didn’t say the same about them when they’d brag about winning.@BobBurg11324144 @memgrizz @warriors No history and no accomplishments 🤷‍♂️The Tech execs v. Media battle is now actually headed to the courts.

In this case, it's Ubiquiti CEO (and Memphis Grizzlies owner) @RobertPera v. one of the most renowned security reporters ever, @briankrebs https://t.co/XxirPOtqTe@ohafford @memgrizz @warriors Not really I’m not the poverty franchise that’s never won anything like absolutely nothing lol@Ricky83248514 @BallySportsSO @JaMorant @memgrizz @thefishnation @ChrisVernonShow He didn't tell those kids how to live....@DogSurfRoadshow @memgrizz @warriors If you expect the Grizzlies to be scared...don't. https://t.co/LyOBpkiPO6@joeywestsidee @memgrizz @warriors Yes it is...for you!@Grizz_Lead People so funny….”sleeping bear”?!!    Lmbo!!  You meant a comatose bear, right??  SMH. The HATE and disdain for the @memgrizz is palpable at this point. 🤦🏽‍♂️😂😂😂😂😂@ArcticString @DogSurfRoadshow @memgrizz @warriors Basically what I’ve learned is if the Grizzlies Win anything. Then afterwards folks like Warriors Fans just want our players and fans to shut up and not brag n such. You know like they do.🧐😆NeverThis is no longer a record store account. It is now a @memgrizz fan account.Memphis Grizzlies are too cocky idk if that’s a championship mindset@BetMGM THE Memphis Grizzlies@KlayForTrey @warriors Iggy has more championships than @memgrizzLETS GO MEMPHIS GRIZZLIES!! 😂😂😂 https://t.co/jOuvupD28Vi still can’t get over this @memgrizz https://t.co/JD345dcy8s@TheHoopCentral I have been watching the nba for 56 years.
