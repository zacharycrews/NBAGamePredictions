The Seahawks are the Cleveland Cavaliers with Lebron. If Russ doesn't play like an all star, the team has little chance of winning. So my point stands, Pete is allowed to be average.Cleveland Cavaliers vs Miami Heat 12/1/2021 Picks Predictions Previews

I'm sure the Cavs are heated but legally I don't know if they have recourse.For every dunk this season, our friends at @Lexus have teamed up once again to donate $10 to the Cavaliers Community Foundation.
