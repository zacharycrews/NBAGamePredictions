#ThunderUp #RaisedByWolves https://t.co/ikcxM2z5Px@Dom_2k June 18, 2021: (Horford) traded by the Oklahoma City Thunder with Moses Brown and a 2023 2nd round draft pick to the Boston Celtics for Kemba Walker, a 2021 1st round draft pick (Alperen Şengün was later selected) and a 2025 2nd round draft pick. 2021 1st-rd pick is BOS own.@NBATradeGuy @wokelonzo @MadManLeaks @CozyLito @PauloAlvesNBA @Benny_Profane_ @MemphisX_NBA @jmere09nyc @YrAvgRocketsFan @tankathon At 16, The Oklahoma City Thunder select Nikola Jovic

The 18 year old fits the obvious goal of this young Thunder team and that’s adding young talent, he’s very skilled for his age. With the right development Jovic can very good, defense fixing is a must however. https://t.co/QigHZcOJhvOklahoma City Thunder Starters:

#NBA #sport #dataanalyst #financialfreedomI'm VERY interested as to whether the Oklahoma City Thunder are granted a hardship exception.

The #Thunder have three season-ending absences (Dort, Jerome, Muscala) while Giddey and JRE still lack a timetable.

A team can receive a exception when 4+ players have missed 3+ games.We are officially in CLINCHING SEASON! 

With a win tonight against the Miami Heat, the Phoenix Suns will clinch a playoff spot. 

They can also clinch a playoff spot with a loss by the Minnesota Timberwolves, who play the Oklahoma City Thunder tonight.@Vision11ofc Pls add nba game tommorow Minnesota timberwolves vs Oklahoma City thunderThe Oklahoma City Thunder face the Minnesota Timberwolves in Wednesday's NBA Basketball Action.
