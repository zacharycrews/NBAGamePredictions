I think that's obvious@nightnurse38 @krispursiainen @nyknicks Trevor Ariza, Nene, Gallinari; I know it.@STweetycat @krispursiainen @nyknicks I think we squandered Knox. It's a shame, to be honest.@STweetycat @krispursiainen @nyknicks This was a good draft because the scouting was on point. All 3 will workout anywhere. In the last few years, we have made some great choices.@hhpthebook @nyknicks @MSGNetworks @23savage____ I prefer we keep our money saved for other options if Mitch is seeking $14 mill a year. You'd be okay with paying both Mitch and Noel that kind of money at the same time when we have Sims on a rookie deal?@STweetycat @krispursiainen @nyknicks No, not really. We got to go way back. And remember, we have always traded what we had, and they end up stars else where.@NewYorkOrDeath @nyknicks @MSGNetworks @23savage____ Mitch is much better than Sims, bit I prefer we keep Mitch@LeBron_Wire I knew that Russell Westbrook to the New York Knicks rumor was a bold face lie the minute it surfaced. 👎 They failed to go all-in for point guard Fred VanVleet, being cheap, 47 million for Westbrook out of the question.@nightnurse38 @krispursiainen Can you remember when the @NYKnicks had a better draft?@hhpthebook @nyknicks @MSGNetworks @23savage____ We are going to pay RJ so it really doesn't send any message, it's just business. With Mitch's injury history and size it would be very understandable if they move on from him. I mean Sims is basically giving you almost the same production so why pay Mitch $14 mill a year?@NewYorkOrDeath @nyknicks @MSGNetworks @23savage____ Then what signal does that send to your other young players. Mitch has done everything right, and you trade him or let him walk, really?@hhpthebook @nyknicks @MSGNetworks @23savage____ Man I pray 🙏 to god that Thibs gets fired after the season. He has shown his true colors this year which are he is a liar 🤥, stubborn he’s like iron really rigid no bend , he puts nothing into development!@podoffame 
Little TMI,but I'm about to start this https://t.co/81Ov0HmVDk 1990's the Knicks were a hot ticket @TheGarden .Fans flooded MSG to actually see the Knicks not the other team's stars! &amp; the opposing team stars were not treated like conquering heroes 🤨
@nyknicks https://t.co/IsQsMZuqqH@nyknicks Dump Julius &amp; Kemba, then sign:
Jalen Brunson (25)
Thomas Bryant (24)
I’d give the Dallas pg $100m or more if the market dictated it &amp; sign the Wizard center for very little. Bryant can play the 4 as well.
I’d then give my young current roster players another year. @SBondyNYDN🧵: @nyknicks have to make a decision not just for these last 6 or so games but as well in the offseason. Julius Randle is NOT the future and neither will Thibs if he doesn’t change his ignorant and stubborn perspective on young players. Its not a good fit for this roster. https://t.co/fF269mLL7H@nycSportsfan718 @nyknicks @MSGNetworks @23savage____ Straight factsKnicks play today! Cade is good, but Star J should bounce back. Squad up Let’s go!! @nyknicks  #newyorkforever #nba https://t.co/PLTs0xV5kd@hhpthebook @nyknicks @MSGNetworks @23savage____ Sign him to the Max. if Simm starts outperforming him then you got a valuable trade chip. But you don’t want to loose assets. Thibs fucked us by making them extend Nerlens, Alec &amp; Randle.Carreno-Busta, Pablo - Sinner, Jannik

Or, y'know, wish the guy a happy birthday@Coach_MRobinson @nyknicks I feel you. Any other coach I’d be with you. Thibs however, has a track record.@nyknicks @RyArch15 Hope money kicked off his bday festivities last night in South BeachWhat’s Luv❔

This is a trend with Thibs. He wears on guys over time and I believe Randall and a few others have hit a wall.@3randyn @nyknicks @RyArch15 @qdotgrimes Oh come on! Ryan needs minutes now too? 😆@patrickbetdavid The @nyknicks and I would hire smart people and let them run the business.

I would sit back and write checks.

Miami Heat vs Brooklyn Nets

The Nets are coming of a disappointing 132-120 loss to the Memphis Grizzlies.🔥

Meanwhile, the Heat's run of poor form continued, as they lost 111-103 to the New York Knicks on Friday.📉

I will be relaxing and cheering haha, no work.@mikeviimusic @iamrahstradamus you are both thinking about this in basketball terms when I am thinking about it as a pure exercise of narrative.  last year (act 1) Trae Young tormented the knicks into oblivion, this year (act 2) he gets to eliminate the nets, next year (final act) New York gets comeuppance@nyknicks @RyArch15 Happy Birthday mate!

I just defend him from the trolls who take it to far like I do every player. 

I still don’t like Obi but he’s played very well the last 2 games. Hopefully it continues@nyknicks @RyArch15 @qdotgrimes i love ryan tbh@NBA_NewYork 😂😂😂 You're such a Knicks fan.👍If the @nyknicks don’t make the playoffs (or even the play in tourney) they must fire Tom Thibodeau.@Fede_Campii @nyknicks Obviamente!!!@2_Shanes Got that JR Smith trait 😂 New York Knicks JR, that mf will launch and then its a wrap.@70sFanNBA I’m a big time fan, and I was just wondering if there’s any 1968 New York Knicks vs Philadelphia 76ers Playoff footage available? As in does it exist? 

This seems to be the only series “Prime” Wilt and Prime Willis Reed went at each other.

Good bad and ugly. Nothing is over night. #Knicks@CabernetAdams @hhpthebook @nyknicks Not according to Thibs, it also makes you wonder about his mindset the lashing out at the media and fans know.

Last year they were 0-12-1 with Leddy/Eberle vs three higher seeds.As a @nyknicks fan is much rather lose in the play-in then not make it there at all #hottake #NBA #nyknicksThe New York Knicks have ‘no interest in a potential Russell Westbrook trade this summer. #Knicks https://t.co/9o1K4ys7VQ@APOOCH They my #2 behind the @nyknicks let’s see what they do now that Kyrie can play in BK.#knicks #knicksnation @nyknicks @NY_KnicksPR  I’m even more convinced now that Thibs needs to be fired for his stubbornness and his inabilities to trust the youth movement. We would be in the playin if he had chosen to go with the youth movement and benched the vets! #firethibs@nyknicks Quick Grimey Deuce benchmob is OP to be honest, three potential ball-handlers, defense, and  shooting. Ball movement, player movement, fast paced gritty basketball. 🧡🔥💙@KinG_Easy @nyknicks @cavs I got the ewing home white at the mall mitchell &amp; ness.Knicks’ Tom Thibodeau lashes out at social media critics: 'Nitpick this, nitpick that' - New York Post #knicks he did not right lineup. Did not hold Randle accountable for defense but benched Walker way too early and made it hard for him to get Rhythm.  https://t.co/w00DPFamm6@ariojosdemiel @nyknicks @cavs Fire 🔥
