So the scorer shouldn't mark that as a missed shot ideally5/3 #FREE #NBAPlayoffs Card 🏀

Pretty cool Brewers and #Bucks collab. https://t.co/dWBKpbuQMf@olskool888 @Bucks Question. @olskool888 is does George Hill get his rotation spot back when healthy over Jevon. I say resounding No. Jevon has been a revelation. The on ball pressure without fouling is outstanding. He’s also not a liability on offense that he maybe was in past.

Always has been a Hill fan though…@Bucks WVU fans will always love the Bucks organization/coaches/fans for appreciating Jevon!@olskool888 @Bucks No doubt that the bucks are  a better team with Jevon Carter. I love what he brings to the bucks.The @Bucks beat the @Celtics in game one. Can they win again tonight? 

#wannabet #fearthedeer #Sports #Basketball #NBAplayoffs #NBA #NBATwitter@olskool888 @Bucks With all due respect… Who cares? Lol@MoneyMids @olskool888 @Bucks Also, poor Hill lmao

Was cut so we could win a title. 

Now benched so we can win another? 🤣

Or you think Buds gonna shit on Jevon when Hill neck feel better?@ToxicGam3r02 @celtics @Bucks @NBAonTNT @985TheSportsHub If lose : 😠😠😠@MoneyMids @olskool888 @Bucks Oh no doubt. He fucked up. But if he did come here, I have zero doubt he'd have excelled greatly. His loss@NBA @Bucks Sports Talk Radio and television get the most listeners &amp; viewers when they’re talking about controversy between star athletes and their inflated egos needing to be stroked time &amp; time again. Giannis is that generational player who cares more about winning than himself.@x_WolfMan_41 @olskool888 @Bucks He could’ve been apart of this team instead he can watch us from his couch with Katie and Kryrie@Bucks @Thanasis_ante43 Playoff Thanasis is next level and beyond.@x_WolfMan_41 @olskool888 @Bucks Dragic has a history with the Bucks, chemistry matters. He made the wrong choice and Carter has been a seemless fit. No complaints here.@DGBFan @olskool888 @Bucks I feel like we are seeing a change in philosophy into making sure you have defense at every position in most of the nba. (Not all, golden state for example). But most.@Bucks Shooting you love ❤️Game 2, Eastern Conference semi final. Milwaukee Bucks vs Boston Celtics.@Bucks Umm. Middleton is participating in the shootaround? 👀👀#bucks@Bucks Wait a minute... 🤨@olskool888 @Bucks I think based on what Dragic did for the Nets, the answer is unequivocally yes.@MoneyMids @olskool888 @Bucks I want to say yes. Though Dragic clearly had some left in the tank. Jevon was nothing with nets. The Giannis effect is very real. Dragic could have really excelled with us. We'll never know but I think he'd have been a great fit. Either way, Jevon been amazing@NBAonTNT @Bucks @celtics @warriors @memgrizz Whoever wins out of these teams right here will be in The NBA finals@JakeCrain_ @CrainCompany Milwaukee Bucks +5 #boosterclub@Bucks Today go winnIn Photos: Bucks shootaround in Boston before Game 2.@dane_dlsu @bball_ref @Bucks Lebron has failed in 15/19 seasons 🤢🤮@dane_dlsu @bball_ref @Bucks No cares about your copy and paste bullshit, the post is about Jrue.@celtics @Bucks @NBAonTNT @985TheSportsHub Good luck@csmif8 @Bucks Easier to be the underdog with no pressure all the way through. Should they be favored, yes. But less pressure this way since the national media are idiots.@PinataIsA10 @celtics @Bucks @NBAonTNT @985TheSportsHub very unlikely@olskool888 @Bucks Absolutely he is@celtics @Bucks @NBAonTNT @985TheSportsHub Incoming L@olskool888 @Bucks He has made more than enough shots since been a buck he is 58 from field and like 55 from 3 and his defense is next level! Goran Dragic is at the house he can score the ball but he ain’t the defender that Jevon is! Buck should be happy they got Jevon instead of Dragic..@olskool888 @Bucks No question.@olskool888 @Bucks Not close. Bucks needs dogs on the perimeter to allow giannis and Brook to protect the paint. The fact guys like Carter become available shows how few teams know how to build winners.@olskool888 @Bucks Underrated on drives to the hoop. Checks all the boxes really. Some nice rebounding in game 1 also.@LCRlene @Strawhat__Kenny @Pants2k_ @celtics @Bucks @NBAonTNT @985TheSportsHub Bucks own you Arlene@djbrainlab @BordDail @olskool888 @Bucks Yes, I'm sure it's because he's been told to defer to the main shooters. Plus he doesn't care about stats. He wants to get everyone involved.@celtics @Bucks @NBAonTNT @985TheSportsHub We need this one it's a must win@TheRealKeithJr @Hequilesjr7 @Bucks @Thanasis_ante43 Of courseIt's safe to assume that tonight is a must win game for the Celtics. They can't afford to go to Milwaukee trailing 2-0 against the Bucks. #NBAPlayoffs@olskool888 @Bucks His early help in Game 1 was masterful.@olskool888 @Bucks 100% plays far better on ball defense and his shooting has been pretty serviceable@celtics @Bucks @NBAonTNT @985TheSportsHub I don’t see Celtics going 0-2 tonight I feel like this will be their bounce back game obviously things went left in Game 1 I believe they have a better Game plan all is not lost so I’m not going call this game a defeat I believe they will tie up the series tonight we shall see@BordDail @olskool888 @Bucks I’m pretty sure it is because he knows his role.@olskool888 @Bucks Thanks Dragic for not choosing the Bucks. Carter is a much better player in the Bucks system because he's tenacious on D.@djbrainlab @olskool888 @Bucks yes but he is passing half of the open shots that he gets. I am guessing it's a confidence issue or he needs to be extremely open@olskool888 @Bucks @VERSACE_Van love carter man@Bucks gunna slap the Celtics tonightMilwaukee. Bucks. Basketball. 

That is all.@jasonquinn3000 @JonAriasRadio @HellerSports @TomBrady @Bucks @Giannis_An34 you predicted it lol@BordDail @olskool888 @Bucks Umm… he is shooting 50.6%fg and 55.8% 3pt@FortyEightMins @Bucks @Giannis_An34 @celtics @nbatopshot @NBA @NBAonTNT TS onay7@BleacherReport @Bucks the disrespect@Bucks @Thanasis_ante43 How about we take Thanasis’ energy into every game instead of just this one👀@olskool888 @Bucks He's Baby PJ wish we definitely need this time of year.  What a pick-up!@DS50_ @JahBlessAyiti @jaaybennett @King_CoopALoop @samkim84 @MagicJohnson Like I said Milwaukee Bucks is worth 2 Billion and the Lakers worth 5 Billion with more residence that's currently leaving Los Angeles, and Milwaukee pays for the highest paid NBA player and quarterback, and have the biggest festival in America, where you from ? 🙄@olskool888 @Bucks He’s been great for the Bucks@celtics @Bucks @NBAonTNT @985TheSportsHub Wear your home whites@celtics @Bucks @NBAonTNT @985TheSportsHub jaylen 40 ball tn@Bucks Listening to some of these reporters, I can't wait until the bucks go up 2-0 tonight.@olskool888 @Bucks my only issue with him is that constantly passes open shots, which is an indication that he can't really make them. His playmaking kinda makes up for it tho@NBA @Bucks Nothing but respect.  ❤️@Giannis_An34@BGCMilwaukee @Bucks @cousinssubs Love this!@olskool888 @Bucks One game? He’s been very good since joining the bucks.@TheRealKeithJr @Hequilesjr7 @Bucks @Thanasis_ante43 Never said he would@olskool888 @Bucks Definitely a better fit. Goran's better days are in his rear view mirror.@bball_ref @Bucks Perfect player to play with an All timer like Giannis@olskool888 @Bucks Way better! Never really wanted Dragic. Don’t think his chemistry would have worked.@bball_ref @Bucks Jrue in a few years is gonna be a consensus HoF lock@olskool888 @Bucks Not familiar with the Bucks Cap space at all but the way Jevon Carter has been playing D if it’s him or Goran Dragic, considering Jevon is 10 years younger than him gonna go with Jevon@olskool888 @Bucks I thought that Jevon would be a great fit on the defensive end but we would miss put on Goran’s offensive ability… Little did I know that Jevon was going to be shooting lights out as a Buck!! Amazing signing for us@NBA @Bucks 48 second mark. I’m not crying, you’re crying.@celtics @Bucks @NBAonTNT @985TheSportsHub Fear the DEER 🦌 ....@McClellanKenny2 @Hequilesjr7 @Bucks @Thanasis_ante43 He’s never getting real minutes for us let’s just be real lol, but it doesn’t matter his energy on the bench goes unmatched. It’s about the culture@NBA @Bucks @Jrue_Holiday11 Underrated…@NBA @Bucks Been a Bucks fan since the 70’s and have seen some talented players over the years. This guy is another level. His tenacity on the court and his humbleness off of it make him a generational talent. Go Bucks! 🏀@olskool888 @Bucks He's still only 26. He has done room to improving his 3 pt shot. Especially if he stays on the Bucks. I would love to see him next season.@NBA The @Bucks and @warriors Will Go Up 2-0 #NBAPlayoffs@celtics @Bucks @NBAonTNT @985TheSportsHub Lets go Celtics 🍀🍀🍀@olskool888 @Bucks 100% and he also wants to be here unlike dragic@olskool888 @Bucks No question....@nbated That was the episode where the Milwaukee native and Bucks fan didn't make it to Final Jeopardy@Pale_Pete @olskool888 @Bucks PJ is a pit pull.

That being said what is G.

Oh the irony@olskool888 @Bucks He’s better than hill@Hequilesjr7 @Bucks @Thanasis_ante43 I think as long as he continues to improve like he has been he’ll keep his spot without Giannis, his energy just sometimes gets the best of him like he moves around and fouls a little too much but I think he’s deserving of his spot@GraAllenMuse @NBA @Bucks Biased as fuck@mcwheezer @Bucks @Thanasis_ante43 Not everyone is Grayson Allen@metabilia_io @Bucks found it thank you@olskool888 @Bucks He’s been amazing with the Bucks.

No question.@Hequilesjr7 @Bucks @Thanasis_ante43 I’m sure there’s a few players out there that could take his spot but how many of those g leaguers are ready to give his energy and intensity off the bench while knowing he’s only gonna play maybe 5-10 mins a game if that👀Gear up for the Eastern Conference Semi-Finals with a free giveaway of Giannis autographed game-worn sneakers!!

 Robert Williams also  nees to get confident in his mid range jumpshot(He's capable and has shown it) ...The other thing in the NBA is location.

First day of my Race Gender Sport class the day after the Milwaukee bucks walked out of their playoff game and WNBA players wore shirts with 7 bullet holes.@MeGrizzliesMuse @NBA @Bucks Your team won’t even come close to making it out the second round. You barely survived the timberwolves. Also Celtics don’t play football on the court like Giannis does.

@joemurr729@IKE_Bucks @Bucks @celtics Big game today@bball_ref @Bucks Very cool stat! It’s crazy this is only Jrue’s 60th. More than half coming from last year and this year.♥️ from Milwaukee

WC Bucks https://t.co/BvgsK1c61o https://t.co/AYTsx1V6cW@SeanReichner @Bucks Correct! Larry Bird eclipsed 400 assists in his 68th career playoff game. Had all the other requirements well beforehand.Grant did not hold up at all against Giannis is game 1 

4-8
10 points 

He will obvioulsy get another chance, but they have to figure out a way to make that group work defensively

The Bucks usually play two bigs, and the 5-out lineup can shred that milwaukee defensive scheme@Bucks Good luck but it's gonna be really tough tonight. Boston playing with their backs against the wall (can't come back from 0-2 down going on 2 road games).

If the Bucks manage to win again (and i sure hope they do, lol), i am gonna be highly highly impressed!@Bucks Good morningWhat's it like to cover Giannis on a daily basis? What's it like cover a totally likeable superstar?

LmaoMilwaukee Bucks Fear Deer NBA Womens Large L Tshirt 50 Anniversary NBA Champs https://t.co/gKfOpSIo85 #eBay https://t.co/ODi0M42HVK@WooMadeKell @Bucks @PicknSaveStores Woo made kelly.Kelly.. you don't even speak English 'bro'@WooMadeKell @Bucks @PicknSaveStores Again with Boston pop and market size (per cap) we would have more. Also by far more loyal fans.@Leymerge @Bucks @Giannis_An34 It’s according to God’s Holy plan not our plans. They recruit the best players to build Super Teams and end up losing because some players are just too arrogant. Look at Nets for instance. Just saying!🤷🏾‍♀️BRON DAILY TAKE #00036

What @Bucks have built around Giannis is what @cavs should have done for @KingJames in his first 7 years, as long as Giannis stays healthy, he has a solid chance in exceeding MJ's 6 rings, meanwhile Bron is still fighting for 2 more, just feel bad for Bron@WooMadeKell @Bucks @PicknSaveStores They were literally championships@WooMadeKell @Bucks @PicknSaveStores Not counting masl which is 7. So half and our population of mke and green bay is less than Boston area, so original point stands. 

Keep tryingThe Milwaukee Bucks are winning it all this year I need @stephenasmith needs to let the word know that!!!
@Giannis_An34 is unstoppable@WooMadeKell @Bucks @PicknSaveStores Let me know when you have a point@Bucks Let's mf go!!!! https://t.co/bS1xWeTV2G@WooMadeKell @Bucks @PicknSaveStores Also that was just one of the teams here@WooMadeKell @Bucks @PicknSaveStores Before afc? I said championships total.... yikes. Also, smallest@Leymerge @Bucks @Giannis_An34 My thoughts are nothing like your thoughts,”says the Lord.“And my ways are far beyond anything you could imagine.For just as the heavens are higher than the earth, so my ways are higher than your ways and my thoughts higher than your thoughts.”Isaiah 55:8-9By the way, Milwaukee's offensive rating was just 100.0 in Game 1. The Bucks were 3rd in the NBA this year at 114.3.

Boston was 23-3 this year and had won 16 straight when holding teams to 1 point per possession.

The last loss?  At San Antonio the day after Thanksgiving.Congratulations to TSALEX (@ahunt940) who moved up 1 spot to take #5 on the Milwaukee Bucks team leaderboard.

But the @Bucks will repeat, said it here first. 🤫Golden State Warriors vs. Milwaukee Bucks 2022 NBA Finals@Bucks We run the east fuck it the whole league shaking rn#Bucks w/ Wesley Matthews, Jordan Poole &amp; Kevin Looney, Tyler Herro…heck of a start to the NBA playoffs for city of Milwaukee / state of Wisconsin hoopers… Of course you’ve still got Jimmy Butler &amp; Jae Crowder doing their thing…@Bucks Hospital ring doesn't count@Rxzehs @Bucks @MiamiHEAT same conference brodie 😂Collective tenacity and collective togetherness. https://t.co/dfdwa8Hq8MMilwaukee got the playoffs lit… Bucks, Poole, and HerroMemphis fan, but imma take @Bucks &amp; @MiamiHEAT in the finalsLet’s send em home @Bucks https://t.co/OoGhyOGO7JThe bucks size is going to be a problem though, no other team left in the playoffs as big as milwaukee &amp; their bigs ain't that slow.  Lopez , giannis at the front court and jrue on the perimeter. 😅my prediction in the 2nd round:

GS Warriors in 7
Phoenix Suns in 6
Miami Heat in 6
Milwaukee Bucks in 7“They have got the best player alive, they are the best team in basketball”, Nick Wright hails Giannis Antetokounmpo ; Regards Celtics overrated after Nets clean sweep https://t.co/WYkkJ0QtfS #BostonCeltics #MilwaukeeBucks@Bucks Memo to Brooklyn - thank you for giving up on Carter@bucksback2back @Bucks yea i don’t got anything to say man celtics didn’t show up to play. bucks played great defense and we couldn’t make any shots but it’s on to game 2@Dro2H @couldbeusgoaIs @nojumper @thoughtfulbae @JBW90 @NoPauseTv_ @overtime @Anotherlogan @trevor_norris0 @JustinTarnation @RaidersMunoz @AirDokkan @Bucks @DerekJBiz @BeSmoove7 Let's go, https://t.co/NKibVJ4tbb@Bucks All you can say is DAMN!!!!

Whoop whoop.@Bucks Heads up play right there. Giannis should be using that up and under move more often down around the basket bcoz now he's becoming mid range threat the defense will overreact jump which @Giannis_An34 can now use the u&amp;u or a good ball fake to draw fouls to get to the FT line.@KeithGrant09 @Bucks Ok ok remember I told you they overrated Brooklyn the true ballers playing this round....

Will be living enviously through all collectors who own this. Such a beautiful moment@iWriterGirl I’m more interested in this Heat/Sixers than I am Celtics/Bucks I think. I wanna see what Harden has. I think Milwaukee will be too much for Boston. GS and Memphis though might be the best series of the playoffs though. Luka vs Booker and Paul is gonna be good too.I guess the Clippers and Nets don't matter so tear them down and have a draft with all there players.

Before the west had strong teams form literally the 1-8 spots, east usually had 2-3. This year the east had 6-7. That’s not usually the case@Shayminn @celtics @Bucks Love this.

He’s the best player on the planet and gets more excited about dunking Oreos in milk than dunking on Celtics in the playoffs. He’s so damn humble and it actually feels genuine. Absolutely my favorite player, even as a pacers fan@bookie_blitz It’s a series already I just called BUCKS IN 7 And if they steal GM 2 this series is over in 6 or less! Tomorrow is a MUST win for Boston. Milwaukee don’t lose at home in the postseason recently often.@GraAllenMuse @Bucks He’s good just a bad person"It's instincts." 

Inside the Mind of Giannis' off the backboard dunk. 🔥 https://t.co/l01YnReMhs@NBAonTNT @NBA @ESPNNBA Unless someone in the east put together a super team.  @Giannis_An34 and the @Bucks will have the same run LeBron had in the east 8 or 10 straight finals appearances. They're pretty much head and shoulders above everyone else in the east.@Bucks Delete this.Milwaukee Bucks winning it all@NYKnickGuy @marknemi @nbatopshot @Bucks It's no change.

But, you're right Magic to remind fans that the NBA still needs the Lakers and Knicks to be in contention.

A couple of more finals with teams like Milwaukee Bucks v. Phoenix Suns can spell trouble for the league.@ramirtorres1 @stephenasmith @Bucks @BrooklynNets Celtics gotta push back even more. Live with Giannis beating you from@the perimeter. Especially with Khris out. Bucks are good but I think Celtics will make some great adjustments.Two things I think about the #NBA East Conf Semis.
1. The @Bucks are going to continue to make my @BrooklynNets look worse and worse for letting the @celtics sweep them.

2.

But, game 2 is must win for the Celtics. If they can’t win on their home floor, the Milwaukee crowd will help motivate the Bucks players to sweep them. I guarantee it.@Bucks Greatest player of this generation .. straight facts ! 🔥🔥@Bucks Get him on the books for next season.@DXJ_15 @bluewirepods @warriors @Suns @memgrizz @dallasmavs @MiamiHEAT @celtics @Bucks You mean normal beef steak lol?Join us tomorrow night starting at 5:30 PM at Becket's to cheer on the @Bucks in Game 2!!
