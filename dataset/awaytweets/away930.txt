But the Jazz were destroyed by injuries &amp; covid for the entire month of January.

The Utah Jazz were only 1 game out of best record in the entire NBA as recent as January 5th until all their players got injured, sick, &amp; concussed.Me: Are LeBron &amp; the Lakers playing Rudy Gobert &amp; the Utah Jazz tonight?
Him: No. They're playing the Mavs.
