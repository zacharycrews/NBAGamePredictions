The "basketball hell" moniker actually dates back to the '90s.

Outside of a brief run in the early '00s, there's been a lot of L's in Sactown.@SacramentoKings @quetismo @nemi1599 real ones know @bennie_barrow23@SacramentoKings @igotitauction No thanks ......The first reference of the Sacramento Kings as "Basketball Hell" was Spud Webb to Mitchell Richmond, but Rudy Gay always gets all the credit. At least that's the first reference I know. It wouldn't surprise me there was an earlier one.@thesgpmvp @SHSIInvesting @BehemothBaller @TheNBACentral Kings will always have a very good fan base no matter how dogshit they are.

[FD(25.2) DK(25)]@SacramentoKings can I get tickets to the last game tomorrow out here in Phoenix.. Would need two for me and the boys.. the 3 year old can sit on my lap. #KangsThe Clippers keep Bradfather's NBA Law as Los Angeles routs the Kings 117-98. 23/12/8 on 8-14 for Paul George to lead the Clippers. 22/7 on 10-18 for Davion Mitchell to lead Sacramento in the loss.The LA Clippers clinch an 11th straight non-losing season by reaching 41-40, defeating the Sacramento Kings 117-98.

So many 3s. Only players that didn't get one of the 21 made by Clippers tonight was Amir Coffey (4 minutes) and Ivica Zubac (reddest light on the team).🏀 Final Score 🏀

https://t.co/IIuYCTQSAD81 in the books. The Kings looked like a team ready for the 2021-22 season to end Saturday night at Crypto Arena. Paul George put Sacramento on blast to help lead the Clippers to a 117-98 win. Here are six quick thoughts from the Kings' 52 loss of the season.J-Char with the aggressive goal to restore a 2 goal lead. Vancouver truly are the Sacramento Kings of  MLS. #rctid #OURHOUSEAlvin Gentry and the Sacramento Kings are challenging the last foul call."Precision Passing P" 

Paul George matched his career-high with 12 dimes in tonight's win over the Kings.

He's dished 10 dimes only 11 times in his career, and three of them have come against Sacramento.@SacramentoKings why is Jackson on the team? What a fucking bum. #kingsSacramento Kings Vs LA Clippers - NBA League 2022

It's been hard to watch how bad they're getting done.

@hoopculture13 🤝 @nemi1599 | #SacramentoProud https://t.co/G1KShadm7HNeemias Queta has quietly given the Kings some quality minutes in the first half. 

I spoke to him earlier this season and he said he thinks his defense is the biggest thing he can give Sacramento right now, said he feels he can guard 1-5.@CrownDowntown @cryptocomarena @LAClippers @SacramentoKings I would’ve told them to pound sand.

What ya gonna do…kick me out for repping my team while spending my money in your building &amp; your city?

I got the same treatment 20 years ago in the same building…May 26, 2002 to be exact.

I imagine the @NBA wouldn’t look to kindly on this.#NBA75 | Final 2C⏱️

They used to be not in Kansas City. Or Omaha. But both. If you need Nebraska to help keep your pro team viable, when you have Nate Archibald, just fold already.With 2:53 to go in the second quarter, the LA Clippers lead the Sacramento Kings, 56-36.@Tricoloredpasta @RAZ0RFIST &gt;Purple looks bad
