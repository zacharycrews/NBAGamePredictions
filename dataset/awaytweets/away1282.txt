Miami Heat host Philadelphia 76ers in the East, while last year's Western Conference champions Phoenix Suns host Dallas Mavericks.

I agree.Especially about @Bucks in 7 vs @celtics,@Suns in 7 vs @dallasmavs.So good--don't you wish the 2 series could go to 9 games...but that would lead 2 supremely exhausted players who'd immediately have 2 focus on their respective #conference matchups⭐️4 unit NBA Parlay⭐️

Dallas is 8-2 ATS last 10.
Dallas is 2/2 ATS vs the Suns in Phoenix. 
Suns are 21-23 ATS at home.
Love the Heat to win big at home tonight and I believe Mavericks cover.

4U plays are 7/11 (63.6%) +14.32U
Let’s make it 8/12 tonight.
