But I guess Spo says it's winning time, fuck it@ESPNNBA definitely Miami heat has shown high reliable game throughout the season so much so they went to the city of Chicago to see Derozan and Lavigne and Tyler Herro ended up smiling by  saying don’t take too personal in other words it is a good reliability team Miami Heat@MiamiHEAT @HeatvsHaters @FTX_Official LETS GET IT BEAT THE RAPTORS@calebbetshoops2 @MiamiHEAT @FTX_Official Facts he done fucking around and this lineup has been going off@julessnba @MiamiHEAT @JimmyButler You have no idea how much money I’d drop for those uni’s https://t.co/ugMNjzPPjs@ryanheming6 Heat and Raptors still have a ton to play for. Miami going for home court throughout playoffs and Toronto trying to stay in 5th.

Difference between 5th and 6th is huge. Right now it’d be whether Toronto sees Philly or Boston in 1st round. I’m sure they’d prefer Sixers.Kyle Lowry makes his return to Toronto as the @MiamiHEAT are in town to take on the @Raptors tonight.

The Miami Heat have a GREAT culture

☝️The Heat host both the Hornets &amp; Hawks in the final games of their regular season schedule.

Winning both would strengthen Miami's bid for homecourt in the East. 

It could also help raise Brooklyn to 8, so they'd be in position to compete for #7 in play-in. https://t.co/Kbobbia998@MiamiHEAT Welcome home kingCongrats to @MiamiHEAT’s own Tim Hardaway! 🔥🔥🔥 https://t.co/F7xolf5T1BStatic Shock: Miami Heat Star Bam Adebayo Unveils DC Comics-Inspired Jordan Shoes https://t.co/9sQCxsV4np via @ComicBook #comics #DCMiami Heat if you are really that serious, I need ya'll to beat the Nets first round#Toronto Mayor #JohnTory declaring 4/3/2022 as #KyleLowry Day as @Klow7 makes his 1st return to #The6ix as a member of the @MiamiHEAT vs the @Raptors!
