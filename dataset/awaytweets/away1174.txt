Miami going for home court throughout playoffs and Toronto trying to stay in 5th.

Difference between 5th and 6th is huge. Right now it‚Äôd be whether Toronto sees Philly or Boston in 1st round. I‚Äôm sure they‚Äôd prefer Sixers.Kyle Lowry makes his return to Toronto as the @MiamiHEAT are in town to take on the @Raptors tonight.

Winning both would strengthen Miami's bid for homecourt in the East.

The Score is your home for #BullsNation Basketball! https://t.co/BTlABH0RP0@MiamiHEAT Someone needs to remind @raf_tyler he‚Äôs a pasty white guy from Milwaukee Wisconsin . He needs to start talking and dressing as such . He‚Äôs not hood . He sounds like a clown when he speaks ‚Äî it‚Äôs cringeworthy. As good a player as he is as he just needs to be himself .For those not in spaces today here‚Äôs my officials so far:

I meant ref fouling out Dedmon made us won. If Dedmon played 5 more min we could not win. Giving that time to Bam helped us.@MiamiHEAT Let‚Äôs get them!!Everyone is healthy for the Miami Heat. This is the first time this season that everyone could be available to play.

Caleb Martin has been clear to play after dealing with achilles pain

What you guys think the rotation is? https://t.co/TcrK1sNWoI@MiamiHEAT Feels like the first time EVERYONE IS AVAILABLE.
