Whatever? We’d be more than happy to take him in Milwaukee…….@schrondo @MoMoneyChanel Not sure how much Sacramento basketball you watch, but Fox has taken a step back and the Kings clearly already regret giving him that contract.

Can compliment Fox and Hali very well. @SacramentoKings #SacramentoProud@SacramentoKings I would actually love Tim Hardaway for Kings coz he is a good all around player can score at will and really can compliment the game of Hali and Fox Dwight Powell could be handy too coz of his contract. Good asset too considering his play #SacramentoProud@jcope11 @MahomesMeloGoat And??? Who wants to watch the fking Sacramento kings??? Most of the Lakers fans that you see for example started watching the lakers either when Lebron came or when Kobe won back 2 back or during their first three peat.

Like Tim Hardaway Jr. not gonna lie that man playing awesome right now and would love him here in Sactown to compliment Hali and Fox. He is more than what Buddy is for Sacramento. No offense to BuddyDon't get me wrong on this, but I don't like this Daryl Morey Strategy. It is like he would drain the depth of your roster to get whatever he wants. I think he ask way too much for Simmons #SacramentoProud @sacramentokings https://t.co/TqgytNyvUa@NBCSKings he is gonna eat the depth of the kings for Ben Simmons. Im all out of this.

@SacramentoKings get Ben Simmons (&amp; an expiring) w/out giving up any picks or taking on Harris contract.

 #Bucks #FearTheDeer #SacramentoKings #SacramentoProud https://t.co/knUgfK7BLgif you play for the Sacramento Kings and voluntarily choose to shimmy before taking a 3, it better go in.

if it doesn’t, this is what awaits you on Inside the NBA. https://t.co/fESyAxiNMY@SacramentoKings @TyHaliburton22 So specialtwitter when Lebron jokingly flexes on tristan thompson on the Sacramento kings bench: 😂😂😂 really flexing a win over kings? pathetic.

twitter when curry gets first career buzzer beater against last seed, tanking rockets: 🥺🥺🥺 MVP so cool lets gooooooooooHad them #2002 vibes today at work. 🔥 @SacramentoKings #mikebibby https://t.co/19i8bR5Llw@CarmeloJreal @Lakers @SacramentoKings @sixers Kings lmfao@JaMvpx Soo? Sacramento Kings beat the nuggets 3 times last season, Nuggets haven’t been healthy all season and we’re missing players tonight as well? Playoffs is a whole different monster than season, Memphis does not have playoff experience, rotations are cut down1/2@briannaa_yh @MahomesMeloGoat You have people the greater Sacramento area who all the sudden became Warriors fans because they were winning. You have a team in Sac. When Sacramento starts winning maybe in the next 20 years (maybe) they’ll be Kings fans@CarmeloJreal @Lakers @SacramentoKings @sixers No thanks on WestbrookWhen did the warriors become the Sacramento kings?Dear god, 
Please make the Sacramento Kings good. 
Amen.@SacramentoKings @TyHaliburton22 So am I. I was born in Oshkosh. I had no idea @TyHaliburton22 was from there too. Now we are both in Sacramento. Congrats Tyrese!@SacramentoKings @TyHaliburton22 GoatedComing up tonight at 10 @WFRVLocal5 @WFRVSports hear from @SacramentoKings @OshkoshNorthHS @TyHaliburton22 on getting his @northhoops retired https://t.co/4HtsBQ0Lj4Who says no?
Just an idea 🤔

@Lakers @SacramentoKings @sixers https://t.co/MNqMqmf9YcDid my first break tonite, random picking I got the Sacramento Kings, if Fox don’t turn out to be a scrub I pulled one card should be worth some loot in the future   https://t.co/rp0WzBjINpCome get Coby @SacramentoKingsTomorrow’s NBA game on @TV5manila is @SacramentoKings vs @Bucks at 9 am.@MileHighGreco @bendoll1 He was my favorite .@SacramentoKings big man ever!  I hope he does well for y'all.  🏀Payton Pritchard and Romeo Langford are so good man, I’d hate to see them traded 👁@SacramentoKings 👁The Sacramento Kings recently announced that they are no longer interested in trading De’Aaron Fox and Tyrese Haliburton. With the Kings still interested in getting Domantas Sabonis, Sacramento can still realistically trade for Sabonis without including Fox or Haliburton.@RobRocha3 @SacramentoKings Sure, you and maybe a couple dozen other people. I just looked it up, the Kings are next to last in the league in attendance.@SacramentoKings What are we waiting on trade for Simmons alreadyThe Sacramento Kings are the Detroit Lions of the NBA, you gotta feel sorry for those fans10/29/03 @KingJames 1st game age (18) 106-(92) L to @SacramentoKings
