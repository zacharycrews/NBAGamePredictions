He is too slender for bigs against normal PF or C, too slow for playing SF.@GobeilNick @pure_raptors @Raptors Turner's comments about wanting more attention/touches sent off alarm bells to me. I don't think that meshes well with Raptors culture, which has gotta be one of the best in the league.@avatart0ph @anthonywald @Raptors To me his perceived value to the league is 0.

Hes barely in the leagues worst team bench

Feel free to face the Nets in rnd 1, I think you can hurt KD's playoff stats😈@avatart0ph @anthonywald @Raptors Again, do you think OG's value is the same now as before he flourished?

Idk what Raps you've been seeing but CB in '22 has been great

Raptors have the 30th offensive bench in the NBA, hes had plenty of chances to show off. 

I hope he figures it out. But his trade value is at 0@avatart0ph @anthonywald @Raptors If you have an apple that has gone bad.

Are you under the impression that you can trade the bad apple for a good one?

What do you think trading him can yield lol.

You wont even get a 2RP@GobeilNick @anthonywald @Raptors OG wasn't a scorer then yet he was given time to finally flourish.
Boucher is crap as hell yet he keeps getting played anyway. 
All it takes is that chance to get out of slump.
They need to be traded if they're so bad.@GobeilNick @anthonywald @Raptors Right.. So why keep him@TDChannel1 The @Raptors meet the @MiamiHEAT in Miami tonight at 7:30PM.  Kyle Lowry has been ruled out of this game for the Heat.

I would love to see svi and yuta play on teams who does more off ball movement. I hope raptors trade them.Jakob Poetl has developed into an elite rim protector and could help this Toronto Raptors squad tremendously.

Bring him back. https://t.co/8OQ8qfOPLg@MarkGuintoBiz @mrjobquitter @RapzFan @NBA @Raptors You don’t remember him sitting out cuz of growth pain or whatever tf it was? 😂In 1998, when No Limit Records was at its peak, Master P attempted an NBA career. He played briefly with the Continental Basketball Association team Fort Wayne Fury.

He then tried out for the Toronto Raptors and Charlotte Hornets, and was cut by both. https://t.co/osItJ7npMX@iJonniM @Raptors @pskills43 Nope just plain nope 👎@NBA @Raptors That's right Spicy P piss on em!@Mattoosaurus Your move @Raptors@Raptors Well done Spicy P@superfan_nav @Raptors I feel like essentially every team in the league shares this exact sentiment lolTonight @Raptors vs @MiamiHEAT #NBA75@Raptors Vote to have your daughter bring a man like this home to your dinner table...@mikekorz @Raptors #WeTheNorth future Raptor????

#LEGENDoftheMiamiHEAT #NBA75 https://t.co/CwHvRIEtib@CannabisXosmos @Raptors The Raptors are playing with kids. The 2021 ring is way more fake than 2020. No playoffs have had less stars. The Raps aren't winning anything but losing stars and winning without Barnes their only lotto pick is super telling. 

Raptors beling in every game. I love this team.@Itzdevito @spTLewis @ItsReallyMarkCM @wahoo3118 This is true. If it weren’t for the Toronto Raptors I’d have no idea that dinosaurs existed.@wensparks @Khem_Birch @Raptors @WeTheNorth Glad to hear that @Khem_Birch  is doing good and well @wensparks@RaptorsHarris @Raptors 🤫 The women of Raptors Twitter are about to come for you HARD. TD not coming back.@LiIMoser @Raptors last season was rough but career 37% from three, we would just use him as someone to kick out to on defense

And if he buys in defensively he's got a long wingspan so he could be solid@Rapsfuckingsuck @Raptors how sustainable is his shooting? bc i remember he kinda stank with the Lakers@ScottBarnes561 How’s the knee? You playing this week? @Raptors@superfan_nav @Raptors You tell Masai this group deserves some help before the trade deadline- they are a decent centre and bench player away from making some noise in the playoffsMalachi Flynn was a bright spot at the end of last year when almost nothing was going right for the Toronto Raptors franchise. After spot minutes and exactly one full game of playing time, a lot of Raps Twitter has given up on him. I still think he has more to show as a player. https://t.co/Ti0za6PSBU@McTannerV1 @Raptors best we can do is Boucher unfortunately@Boards2Buckets @DreamShake_R @nbatopshot @magicsticksz @AntoGiannis @nftmikeymike @MikeIce1 @tlcdl @TS_npdg @ChewieWoolf @Boosh_TK @bbleezy2k3 @dbarri12 Raptors vs Heat, too bad Lowry isn't suiting up, still great to see him back in Toronto!

If the Toronto Raptors could keep Pascal Siakam, the Atlanta Hawks could keep Cam Reddish. Didn't happen. A few of those names could also be traded. https://t.co/TgOt32rQWz https://t.co/pE5azeSTRZThe Toronto Raptors' much-anticipated reunion with Kyle Lowry will have to wait a few weeks

The Miami Heat have listed Lowry out for Monday night's game against the visiting Raptors for personal reasons https://t.co/HR5rUhvEJW@TwoWayh00ps @ScottieBetta @NBACanada @Raptors What's VanVleet then?Toronto Raptors will have to wait on that Kyle Lowry reunion https://t.co/RPtYIhl8ft Via @Mike_Ganter https://t.co/dpEpcyj1TQ@Raptors Triple double @pskills43 is the best version@champssports I Found Toronto Raptors Statement Jersey https://t.co/KwUleZTcXj@champssports I Found Toronto Raptors Statement Jersey https://t.co/w3nkKcQMM0@ShamsCharania @TheAthletic @Stadium @Raptors Legend Stanley Johnson #WeTheNorth@sophiayantastic @HR_6IX @Raptors Lol reasons whats ur definition of "proper shoes"? Lmao 😂 not our fault kd played shit and went 0-6 in OT lmao whereas kawhi got a RING or NOT would have still left ur franchise SAD. And take note, its the past y'all in play-in now 😭 good luck making it to playoffs and stop usWatching the @warriors with my boy. They aren't the @Raptors but they are the next best thing. https://t.co/rVbEzvvPOp@Raptors #PascalSiakam is playing at an #NBAAllStar level ⭐ Beautiful to see!!@suzanneparr @RaptorsGirl99 To do with Booker complaining about the Raptor when they were in Toronto. Pacers playing Jurassic Park theme as an homage to Booker vs the Raptor. I think this will be a theme across teams the rest of the season...also dino costumes 😝@superfan_nav @Raptors Masai and Co will need to address the bench at some point. As much as I love our young guns, a couple vets off the bench could be what the doctor ordered.#PascalSiakam #NBAAllStar @pskills43 @Raptors GET HIM BACK TO THE ALL STAR GAME https://t.co/HnuofZFr0q#PascalSiakam #NBAAllStar @pskills43 @Raptors DONT FORGETTT https://t.co/6CHaQjAjmN@superfan_nav @Raptors Lets hope we get a 20-30 game stretch with FVF, Trent Jr, Scottie, OG and Pascal. With the exception of the Embiids, Jokic, KATs etc of the league, I think we can make up for not having a true C with 5 guys that can guard multiple positions. The ceiling is so high.#PascalSiakam #NBAAllStar @pskills43 @Raptors CHAMP. ALL STAR. KIND. HUMBLE. THE LIST GOES ON https://t.co/BddoOXVYqJ@Bucks @Drake Another lucky win for the Toronto Raptors. They wouldn’t have nearly as many wins if they didn’t have the luxury of playing in a silent arena. Scottie Barnes would average under 11ppg if it wasn’t for the constant ability to be able to hear the play calling.#PascalSiakam #NBAAllStar @pskills43 @Raptors don’t forget this game … #KyleLowry last game as a raptor https://t.co/hARUbxiVtw#PascalSiakam #NBAAllStar @pskills43 @Raptors comeeee onnnnnn this man is an ALL STARRRR https://t.co/xK0W4PrTzo@Raptors Like JC said GET MY SON TO THE ALLSTAR@RaptorsHarris @Raptors Good get rid of Yutass@Raptors Send in a Van Vleet gif admin@Raptors A matter of time we bring back TD https://t.co/Jc2htwUGc8@Sorella905 @Bucks yes. It’s been a looooooooonnnng ass 15 mins.  @raptors OWNED SINCE 2019. #FactsNotFear https://t.co/jyWw4mYzrr@heyhalima Then there's @PhoenixGolf55 who repeats Trade Siakam multiple times on one thread annoying everyone and violating @Raptors own social media rules. And so so wrong.@3PeatCheatSheet @currypistonn So u think the Toronto Raptors and the Detroit Pistons who play in the same conference have played against each other 4 times in 4 years ?Kyle Lowry to miss return to Toronto against Raptors https://t.co/dvn7AM0cNb https://t.co/S3dBV3Fx6B@SpinnyPascal @Raptors Aldridge is top 10. Least we could do is make OG top 10@TrueGoatJames @RealSkipBayless Never forget, the @Raptors caused this outburst 🤣🤣🤣making a webcomic called "girlfriends" and the four characters are a trans raytheon catgirl, a tiktok goth egirl influencer who runs the invader zim wiki, an ancient figure from the woods who speaks ancient malay, and an etobicoke guy (lesbian) really into the toronto raptors@duckketz @nbatopshot TS: Dat_Guy

Not even Marc played in this jersey let alone his brother Pau who never even played for the @Raptors 😂
