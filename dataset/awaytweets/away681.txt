It will take between 20 and 24 more games to surpass Karl Malone.
It will take between 66 and 79 more games to surpass Kareem Abdul-Jabaar.
Best guess for passing Malone is against Toronto Raptors on Mon, Mar 14.Consensus Line Move:

#Betting #FreePicks https://t.co/O4AwTczeKN@jrichardgoodman Bad losses happen.  72-win Bulls lost to the expansion Toronto Raptors who lost 61 games.  The loss isn't on anybody.  It was just fluke.  9 times out of 10, the Warriors beat that same team by 30+ every time.Then there was the GSW era - they still ain't beat none of those teams.

From the caliber of teams that have won rings in the last 10 years, only the Raptors stand in a similar stead as any Westbrook-led team. But even Toronto had Kawhi.Check out this listing I just added to my #Poshmark closet: Vintage Toronto raptors Tracy McGrady Nike jersey. https://t.co/ga9ubO7YTT #shopmycloset @poshmarkapp@TheNBACentral @James_HamNBA future toronto raptorSports while i'm asleep
