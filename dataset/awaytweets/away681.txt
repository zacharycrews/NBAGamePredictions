My 3 Predictions:
-Bradley Beal will score 28+ points and have 8+ assists 
-Rui Hachimura will score 14+ points and have 5+ rebounds 
-Deni Avdija will score 13+ points and have 6+ rebounds 
(The Wizards Will Win 119-113!)

Idk why they don’t use the Toronto Raptor’s formula for developing players in the G league. Luka there too just waiting when we should’ve moved him up and use those minutes before Cam is on the court. But I digress https://t.co/Gwl1ebes4nOn this day in sports history January 21, Philadelphia 76ers Shooting Guard Allen Iverson scored 51 Points against the Toronto Raptors in 2001.@GobeilNick @SonnyRockets_ The thing is Toronto are not close to being a championship contender and don't generally trade picks for veterans unless they are on the cusp.

I know Houston are chasing first round picks but the Raptors have no history of doing this.

Especially for a 33 year old guard.@Raptors #,OG Anunoby # All Star 🌟.  Keep up the amazing job OG. 👏@IndianaMBB @OAnunoby @Raptors This one too #iubbCongratulations to fleury16 who moved up 85 spots to take #80 on the Toronto Raptors team leaderboard.

#Betting #FreePicks https://t.co/O4AwTczeKN@jrichardgoodman Bad losses happen.  72-win Bulls lost to the expansion Toronto Raptors who lost 61 games.  The loss isn't on anybody.  It was just fluke.  9 times out of 10, the Warriors beat that same team by 30+ every time.Then there was the GSW era - they still ain't beat none of those teams.

From the caliber of teams that have won rings in the last 10 years, only the Raptors stand in a similar stead as any Westbrook-led team. But even Toronto had Kawhi.Check out this listing I just added to my #Poshmark closet: Vintage Toronto raptors Tracy McGrady Nike jersey. https://t.co/ga9ubO7YTT #shopmycloset @poshmarkapp@TheNBACentral @James_HamNBA future toronto raptorSports while i'm asleep

He should be giving minutes to banton and Malachi, anyone with half a brain would agree.@jebronsburner @BundIeUp @Raptors He doesn’t allow rookies to develop. Banton had a couple bad games and all of a sudden he gets cut off. Flynn was doing incredible last year and then he doesn’t play him starting the season.
