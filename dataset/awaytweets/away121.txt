And since they are rebuilding, I’m not looking for them to contend for an NBA Championship. Much more relaxing!🚨🚨🚨BANGING #NBA PLAYER PROP BET🚨🚨🚨

Phoenix Suns - Houston Rockets

Christian Wood O10.5 Rebounds @ 1.90 ($100)

Wood averages around 12 rebounds this season so far, and the Suns should also be without Ayton in this one. I expect him to go over.

@HoustonRockets vs. @Suns - 10pm ET https://t.co/pmMHMCNOww@MRChocolatenewz @Harmony47991422 This is truth staring you in the face, Laker guards didn’t contribute enough to neutralize the 3-pointers the Houston Rockets babies made. Lakers made 6—3-pointers TOTAL to Houston’s 16—-3-pointers made. Big scored 84 points.@HoustonRockets We can win this one!!@HoustonRockets Sengun starts. We win.@HoustonRockets If only we had Goatlynyk still 😔 he owns the Suns, we still winning tho 😼@HoustonRockets @Jaygup23 &gt; DJ Augustin.@TheNBACentral @HoustonRockets, this is silas’ fault…@iDude14 When the Lakers learn an actual Offensive System with multiple passes before the shot, weaker teams like the Houston Rockets will be spending more time on defense chasing the ball wing-to-wing. Not enough possession for a 70 point Half.@HoustonRockets Sengun better stay in the line up@HoustonRockets Same game plan as Tuesday fam let the young guns eat early!🚀🚀@HoustonRockets Lets win a basketball game please and thank you@HoustonRockets Samaire #19Jalen Green Houston Rockets Basketball Unisex T-Shirt

Using 3-pointers as the GREAT EQUALIZER when going against far superior talent.  Can't blame Anthony Davis for that.I’m super bummed about the ending to the incredible @astros season.
