But I understand the feeling, I am a Sacramento Kings fan. https://t.co/QXl0qL3T09@jarentalks I do. It’s a great podcast. Given time I don’t think it’s a screw up of a trade for the Kings. Definitely a risky and unexpected one but potentially could work for both sides. Sabonis is already loving it Sacramento, the team seems happier and positive. So we will see2 out of the 3 newest members of the Brooklyn Nets will make their debut later tonight against the Sacramento Kings.

I haven’t heard that he has been shut down for season yet@allin4nft @SacramentoKings @Pacers @iamcartoonist Sabonis is good player, no doubt about it.

I love Hali's game tons and I think the Pacers put a fresh spin on things, hence win win! What are your thoughts on #Sabonis and do you think the #Pacers hang on to #Brogdan or deal him in the off season. #NBA@James_HamNBA He IS missed in Sacramento!

How he still refers to himself as a Sacramento king no matter how many other teams he’s been on@PlayersTribune @TyHaliburton22 @SacramentoKings what we’re ya’ll thinking?!@TyHaliburton22 @PlayersTribune 💔💔💔 The entire Sacramento Kings fanbase was sad to see you go.

Thanks for the Kings memories ✊🏼@PlayersTribune @TyHaliburton22 @SacramentoKings @Pacers So upset the Knicks didn't trade Julius Randle for this kid.Ty your love for Sacramento is truly equaled by the fans and we DID want you here, but winning even changes that.

Your love and sacrifice for us will never be forgotten.@allin4nft @SacramentoKings @Pacers I think the Pacers win this one. If Myles Turner gets healthy, they might make it to playoffs next season.

@iamcartoonist“I guarantee that if you had taken a poll of our locker room that morning and were like, “Which guy on this team most wants to be in Sacramento long-term” … everyone would’ve said me.” Kings messed up. https://t.co/g8HkkRdjHg@allin4nft @SacramentoKings @Pacers @plowking12345 I like sabonis, I think he's really good. If only he or fox (or both) were better shooters... But hey at least they're winning, chasing that play in spot hard!@wheatluke Sacramento kings throwback 👀 probably one of the best fits I’ve ever owned.These damn. Have an AMAZING career, @TyHaliburton22. You may not play for the Kings anymore, but you still have Sacramento with you. https://t.co/rAjE3gnhhTI kind of like the trades the @SacramentoKings made last week. But man, this piece by @TyHaliburton22 was heartfelt and got me a bit emotional. He's going to kill it in Indy. I highly recommend all Kings fans take a few minutes and read this piece.
https://t.co/9dje4bNjvjThis was tough to read. 

I wanted Haliburton in Sacramento forever and it’s doubly tough to know he wanted that too.

Wish him all the best in Indy.

I agree with you Hali has at least the most team friendly game and was needed to get a Sabonis deal done. #NBA@TyHaliburton22 Being a lifelong Kings fan, trust me when I say you were adored here in Sacramento. This wasn't an easy for me...  Trust me when I say that as soon as I get the money, I'll be buying and rocking a Pacers Haliburton jersey! Hopefully, I won't be the only Kings fan to do that...@thekingsherald and the Jerry Reynolds on the #sacramentokings trade deadline, good listen! Go Kings! #SacramentoProud

 https://t.co/P7ZC3ih2eJ@allin4nft @SacramentoKings @Pacers @JakeTheShakeTS I don't see Sabonis resigning but maybe he will. I think Kings could have given Fox instead of Hali.@TyHaliburton22 @PlayersTribune You know you will ALWAYS be a king as far as Sacramento fans are concerned , it’s family .   Pacers are my new side team can’t wait to see y’all get down man .@dustin_lies @SacramentoKings @Pacers @JakeTheShakeTS Hey Dustin like your take but isn't Sabonis the best player in the deal right now and last time I checked 25 isn't old and that is the age on Sabonis' birth certificate? I love Hali's old school game and new school  swag...I see this deal win win #NBA@WilliamHill #YourOdds Sacramento kings vs Nets , Domantas Sabonis 10+ Rebounds &amp; 6+ Assists@TyHaliburton22 @PlayersTribune Tyrese, is there a Sacramento charity that is especially meaningful to you? It’d be nice to get Kings fans to send $20 (in honor of your draft year) towards the community you loved so much.Sacramento went big at the deadline 🤯

As well as the blockbuster Sabonis trade, the Kings got DiVincenzo, Lyles and Jackson and got rid of Bagley 🤔

Do you think the Kings are a better team going forward?

Pacers win the trade. They get like 9 years of haliburton to build around. The Kings have sabonis for two years. Then what? Just to make the play in?@JediOzman @SacramentoKings @Pacers @TheMurathanoglu needed shakeup. Sabonis is younger than people realize.

Of course Pacers with the New young coreThe Indiana Pacers have received a pair of strong performances from Tyrese Haliburton after acquiring him via trade from the Sacramento Kings.

For @HoopAnalysisNet, I analyzed how Haliburton has made a strong early impact.

Sacramento Kings Fan .@allin4nft @designershop63 @SacramentoKings @Pacers Prob not this season. I think Sac has the best chance tho. Sabonis is the most impactful player in this trade that can help carry a team now. Indy is a bit banged up. Not sure what’s going with Brogdon (perhaps injury?) but this trade makes me think he will be moved next.@Jacob_Merced10 @statmuse @SacramentoKings The bum ass kings are desperate for a play in spot and the pacers are rebuilding bozo🤡🤡🤡@leet3_ @designershop63 @SacramentoKings @Pacers You think playoffs this season?@MertAliYeter1 @Kobratakibii @SacramentoKings @Pacers @OguzhanUgur Alright...you're the first to say the Kings got zero!

Sac wanted to get out from Buddy's contract and got an All Star in return. Hali is def a tough loss but u have to give up something to get something.

If you're vying for 8th place, it doesn't make sense.@designershop63 @SacramentoKings @Pacers @leet3_ Same for most indeed... The question I'm asking myself is do these short-term moves really makes sense unless you're going to fight for the conference title?@allin4nft @SacramentoKings @Pacers #NFTGiveaway Same for most.

He did say he was heart broken by the trade but his numbers don't lie.can't decide what's crazier: that the Sacramento Kings were +8 in Buddy Hield's minutes despite him only scoring 13 points on 19 shots (and 1-13 from 3!) or that the Kings lost the EIGHT minutes Buddy Hield did *not* play by 17 points lol@Jack84099556 @urpalnick @statmuse @SacramentoKings God damn tell me you haven't watched these last two pacers game without telling me.. Smfh stat padding. Lol salty boy@DaFamelessGamer @SacramentoKings @Pacers @robertiancoins @taylormadeNF @garrisonlyons8 Even though he was happy in Cali, it's gonna be a good situation in Indi! How long until Pacers are in the running for the East? https://t.co/uEPPbm8ETe@allin4nft @SacramentoKings @Pacers I would have to say Pacers got a good deal out this, They already had Miles Turner who is one of the squatter and getting a great ball hander Hali where he would have been secondary to Fox.

Cheers@ragrant32 @pucklum @SacramentoKings @Pacers @blazersharp0 We will see, does seem like a solid building move for Pacers. Maybe this is the moment to build the foundation that will lead them all the way?@dustindustdus @SacramentoKings @Pacers @yoominachan So far, your perspective is in-line with several others. It'll be dope to watch this Pacers team grow together. Hopefully Indiana Fans have enough patience, ppl forget they burned Reggie Miller's house down, allegedly.@allin4nft @pucklum @SacramentoKings @Pacers TS - ragrant32 @blazersharp0

Pacers did. With Hali, they can build around him as long as they get him to sign a new contract. With Sabonis, no one knows but will likely want to go to a contender in a few years when his contract is up. But we’ll see!The Sacramento kings are really the Oakland As of basketball@allin4nft @SacramentoKings @Pacers best player in the trade is definitely sabonis but the pacers definitely got the better end in the trade cuz of haliburtons potential @yoominachan@vegandoIan @SacramentoKings “hE’s UHhhh bUhM” https://t.co/WtTNz7k96d@BooneFollow187 @SacramentoKings He went 1-15 lol he’s a bum@Yip_Wil @SacramentoKings @Pacers @sharpshotBRob Hali is gonna flourish in Midwest! https://t.co/Xlh2rt9UjF@rhenzokuken_nft @SacramentoKings @Pacers @AntoGiannis Do you think this takes the Pacers in the direction of fighting for conference titles soon-ish?@troytrilla @reecemills9 @Halibuarte @Jacob_Merced10 @statmuse @SacramentoKings We’ve never really done a rebuild before now@allin4nft @SacramentoKings @Pacers @blackslayer1525 I mean here is pacers bcoz of getting hali and hield.. lol@ZoytiTopBuds @SacramentoKings @Pacers @blackslayer1525 Okay!

Go @SacramentoKings ❤️❤️❤️@allin4nft @ZoytiTopBuds @SacramentoKings @Pacers Pacers got the best end of the deal with picks, Hali being their future Point guard, and Buddy Heild is no slouch. I feel like Sabonis was leaving anywaysFlew into Chicago from Sweden yesterday, to go to the @chicagobulls -@SacramentoKings game in @UnitedCenter on the 16th, but our baggade didnt arrive with us, rip, oh well #BullsNation@allin4nft @SacramentoKings @Pacers @sure_sure888 I feel for Kings fans because he really wanted to be there. But watching him on LP yesterday was so much fun! With the injuries Indiana has they'll probably get a top 10 pick this year too. Hali, Brogdon, Hield, Duarte, Turner is a nice reset for a team going nowhere.@allin4nft @SacramentoKings @Pacers #NFTGiveaway @Pacers definitely got the better end of the trade! Lots of young talent coming in to build with Duarte. Hali looks like he’s hungry to prove himself now that Sac has given up on him. @sharpshotBRob@ZoytiTopBuds @SacramentoKings @Pacers @blackslayer1525 You think so...this season?@allin4nft @SacramentoKings @Pacers I don’t think the Kings could get good enough in a trade to make a trade unless it is in management 😅@chaos_vic @SacramentoKings @Pacers @sure_sure888 Haliburton is a problem! https://t.co/376RCD8oBJ@allin4nft @SacramentoKings @Pacers @blackslayer1525 @SacramentoKings will go further if they dont trade hield and hali..@pucklum @SacramentoKings @Pacers Yep, a few people are saying Kings won.

#NFTGiveaway
Does anyone think the Kings got a better deal? I think Pacers won but Sabonis was the best player is the trade which is usually who wins but in this case I’m not sure since Sabonis could walk in 2 years (high likelihood even with them offering the max)@allin4nft @SacramentoKings @Pacers @magicsticksz Hmm it will be close but i think in the end they will be left out of play offNot a player, but a team.

The @SacramentoKings from 1999 to 2004.

Still among the most beautiful basketball ever played in @NBA history. https://t.co/zAk5apbYrF@ZoytiTopBuds @SacramentoKings @Pacers @blackslayer1525 Who do you think will go further this year?!@AntoGiannis @SacramentoKings @Pacers @magicsticksz You think Kings will make the playoffs now?@HTownHarold I’m a Sacramento Kings fan. I know all about dumpster fires and savior front offices. Kings haven’t been good since we both had hair.@allin4nft @SacramentoKings @Pacers Indiana got the best deal for sure they got very good players with big potential , and about Sabonis not a big fan here he is a decent player not something more . I Think Kings made a big Foul giving Haliburton and Hield they are very good players

He shot us out of so many games this season cause he was stat padding@AkibaXv @LasagnaRic3 @Jack84099556 @victor080506 @statmuse @SacramentoKings Fox and Hali couldnt play off eachother and it showed. trading hali give fox more shots and getting an allstar big who can playmake for fox and get him open for easy points is pretty obvious to see. their defense has been better at least from the 2 game example@AkibaXv @LasagnaRic3 @Jack84099556 @victor080506 @statmuse @SacramentoKings Oh yeah so sad we lost hield. just look at elite shooter.
