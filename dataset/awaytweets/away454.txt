Made a couple 3rd quarter bets on SNF. Seeing how that turns out then calling it a weekend. Ugh back to work tomorrow. üòîhad to switch away from that hornets game that was a disaster.. Charlotte is Borrego really your guy?#hornetsNBA Live Scores: PHX v CHA 129-95 4:33mins rem in 4Q (PHX extends their lead, tough to claw this back)...  @hornets@hornets @AthleticBrewing Thanks to the whole team for losing me money. Shits crazy@hornets I‚Äôve lost hope@hornets @AthleticBrewing Need a hot streak in the worst way! 
#AllFly Come on guys!!!@NBA @hornets not even the best bridges in the game@NBA @hornets Scoreboard@NBA @hornets All star in my books@hornets @AthleticBrewing And we know that Borrego will start the same 5 next match. IncredibleObviously it's hats off to JaVale McGee and Deandre Ayton for dominating Charlotte tonight, but the Hornets' decision to go into the season without a center who fit their roster and style of play was very strange@aish__1998 @hornets @AthleticBrewing Man mitch kupchak gotta do something ASAP@hornets @AthleticBrewing Yeah, you can@joanpzls @hornets Ha!  Should have have said 2 of the 3. And we know the 3 as in 28-3üòÇ@NBA @hornets An all star this season
No doubt@Pajita06 @hornets @AthleticBrewing Replace Rozier and Hayward with athletic wings, get a center, try harder@hornets @AthleticBrewing Why put effort in now? Concede &amp; get ready for 2moro. Let the rooks &amp; sophomores run.@hornets @AthleticBrewing We fell off@hornets @AthleticBrewing Waiting on borrego‚Äôs ‚Äúit‚Äôs a long season and our guys need to step up‚Äù quote@hornets How to tell Borrego is incompetent. Down 28 points and plays Ish Smith over Bouknight. Get this man out the Queen City.@hornets @AthleticBrewing How can we improve on defense? (Serious question)@NBA @hornets They‚Äôre down by 30. The announcers need to calm down. lol@hornets @AthleticBrewing WE WANT BOUKNIGHT@NBA @hornets Dweeb call down 30.  "Yowza" ??? Send the Hornets to Seattle immediately@hornets @AthleticBrewing RatioJust a thing of beauty! 

@MilesBridges | @hornets | #AllFly https://t.co/PwHKBuyy99@NBA @hornets why are u posting@NBA @hornets Save ya knees@hornets @AthleticBrewing Yes we can@hornets @AthleticBrewing Give. Bouknight. Terry‚Äôs. Minutes.@hornets Come again??
Here is the low down:
1. The Hornets defend like school girls, not grown men!
2. Terry Roz should go play some G league and sort out whatever the F8ck is wrong with him
3. Gordon is passable, not for the money paid though.
4. Just an insult to GOAT who owns the team.Can't stop fighting.

#NBA75 
#NBAOver 100 points thru 3 quarters make that Ben trade @hornetsCharlotte Hornets did this before left for New Orleans. Panthers need to do this before their fans find something else to do on Sundays https://t.co/m7XOj9AOry@hornets Actually you beat them ,they lowerd the loop for Suns,during the break they did it on other side ,and the side now you are playing they bring back to normal.@camutdforever @hornets still everyone isn‚Äôt backIt feels like the #Hornets are out here practicing closeouts. Phoenix is collapsing the defense and kicking. Charlotte is having to make up tons of ground.The Charlotte Hornets are shooting 30% from the field halfway through the 3rd. They obviously need some sort of scoring punch, yet James Bouknight hasn‚Äôt stepped foot on the court. I don‚Äôt understand what Borrego is doing sometimes‚Ä¶@joanpzls @hornets Sports are dumb hahaY‚Äôall are pathetic @chicagobulls and @hornetsStrongest man in the room! üí™

@MilesBridges | @hornets | #AllFly https://t.co/fDVIwUeRxw@joanpzls @hornets That‚Äôs what I told Sandra.

So yeah, that's how my night is going üôÉ@hornets game is going very wrong this Sunday has been bad@tweetsfromseth I know , they need to flip that @hornets game from 7pm to 1pm!I may have to switch to SNF this @hornets game is so dang ugly@hornets , on a night when all the overpaid actors are doing nothing, play Bouknight. Sometimes coaches get into the deer in the headlights thingy!Back-to-back 3s for Booker!

Stop delaying the inevitableDon't lose hope ü§û

#AllFly https://t.co/GE3VJO9p3sInteresting maneuver from Charlotte, putting PJ Washington as the primary on Chris Paul, letting Miles Bridges tangle with Ayton

Nothing really working for the Hornets, though. Suns super impressive two-way effort: ball movement on offense, rotate/recover on defense@hornets coaches win games and coaches lose games. Players don‚Äôt lose games.Important point made by Eric Collins and Dell Curry on the #Hornets broadcast; after this road trip, Charlotte has only one more game west of the Mississippi River this season (OKC), and the longest trip will be 3 days. 

Schedule is much more favorable the rest of the season.@sixers vs @hornets great game. üèÄ@scottontvKSDK @Suns @hornets @CP3 @DevinBook @DeandreAyton Yes! And, you didn‚Äôt mention you were in town! Lol trying to take some of this #WX back to the Lou?!?GIVE BOUKNIGHT SOME DAMN MINUTES. ITS CLEAR WE NEED A SHOOTER ON THE COURT. @hornets@hornets tf is this ü•≤@de_teat @HornetsOnBally @PJWashington @hornets i can see it aswell they never have chemistry or show love to eachother when they are both on the court@HornetsOnBally @PJWashington @hornets Someone mentioned how Hayward never passes to Melo because he‚Äôs jealous of him. I can‚Äôt unsee it now@VentonBlandinTV @Suns @hornets @CP3 @DevinBook @DeandreAyton Sat behind the @Suns DJ there for last Thursday night's game. Guy did an awesome job! Game was good too!Line it up!
