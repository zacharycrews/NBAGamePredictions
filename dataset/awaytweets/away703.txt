At least they are still in 4th place in the western conference, so if the playoffs were to start today, they would have home court advantage in the first round.  Don’t worry.  The Jazz will start winning a bunch of games.  GO JAZZ!Utah Jazz 3-point percentage vs Golden State 31.3%. If they’re shooting more than 30, they have to make 40% of them. #TakeNote@WillTheDubsWin @utahjazz Ion think you watched the game because JP broke Clarksons ankles, not Rudy 😭🚨 Line Change 🚨

Then, why are they asking for that again  and again, instead of sending someone to install the service? @PLDTEnterprise @PLDTHome @PLDT_CaresStill surreal that Warriors almost lost the game vs Utah Jazz…

Q4 was a stinker!@JonathanLondon @marc2sn3s Rudy was injured and wasn't on the floor, so he didn't matter on the last play.

When Gobert was in for the 4th quarter, they closed the deficit from 8 to 2, and when he came out at 2:30, Jazz were down by 2, and they finished down by 2

#NBA https://t.co/XPkVYKtAjl@PocketYouTube @utahjazz What does he give you towards winning a title that Conley doesn’t? Not saying he’s bad but he’s never been a winner and he’s a much worse shooter. Younger, better scorer and more athletic but I don’t see how he helps the jazz more than Conley@TownBiz96 @ExCossack @jay_pea619 @utahjazz Jazz still aren’t back in rhythm… not shocking since Mitchell is still out 👍@MTmiss1776 @espn @NCAA @NBA I watched John Stockton play in his prime in the late 80s early 90s with the Utah Jazz. He is probably one of the nicest most humble guys I've ever met. I literally quit watching the NBA when he retired.

Jazz fans don’t know basketball@jaycbutterfield @utahjazz His leg was hurt@BibsCorner What playing for the Utah Jazz does to a mf 🤣Golden State Warriors 94 (Jordan Poole 20 pts) Utah Jazz 92 (Rudy Gobert 12 pts, 18 rebs)@nizcomix @RyThaGod @utahjazz Not the worst imo, that goes to Boston@utahjazz It's always "so close" but never a "win". This team collapses in the clutch time. They never scored for the last 4 minutes of the quarter. 4 MINUTES. Chokers.@RyThaGod @utahjazz Fitz is the worst announcer in basketball.@nizcomix @RyThaGod @utahjazz Hahaha stay mad@utahjazz steph 1/13 and we still lost, 11pt quarter for gsw and we still lost, smh@PocketYouTube @utahjazz Yes please. He cant guard shit. That is why the grizz never go so far with him.@utahjazz jordan clarkson needs to be sent to the moon@utahjazz close game, but a great first nba experience. Only regret was not seeing @spidadmitchell but there’s more to see https://t.co/ChiVTgFzGJThe 3rd consecutive @warriors game to go down to the wire. A nail-biting 94-92 W over the @utahjazz 
That 4th quarter was all about defense  for both teams and the warriors hang on@utahjazz Enjoy another 1st round exit.@utahjazz loondog clears that french covid spreader https://t.co/yoKe99o1dV@utahjazz Quinn Snyder thank very much for taking out Gobert lmaoThat @44Bojan 3 was half way down! Why do the basketball Gods hate the @utahjazz??? 😭😭😭 Hell of an effort. That’s all we want as fans. #TakeNote #UTAatGSWWith 30 seconds left, Bojan Bogdanvoić pulled up from deep, BUT the ball went in and out of the basket. The @utahjazz fall short to @warriors 94-92.@utahjazz Y’all had a timeout… + Rudy a bum.Ngeri game NBA Golden state warriors vs Utah jazz. Unlucky 3pts from Bogdanovic 👏@utahjazz Why did Gobert sit on the bench the final 2 minutes? Bonehead moves like that prove why Snyder is the worst coach in the nba@utahjazz As a warriors fan GG@Zstrong12 @utahjazz Thanks man, GGs all around 👌@utahjazz Close only counts in horse shoes and hand grenadines.@utahjazz Curry had the most horrible shooting game of his life and y'all still lose. Just unbelievable, this team sucks ass.Game 47 ❌ (30-17) The @utahjazz come up short by mere inches in a 94-92 loss to Golden State. Two good looks late to win or tie, but no sir

Nice game tho@utahjazz and another loss where the team shoots like shit. In the low 30s from 3 and under 40 from the field. Nobody thought to do anything different? Snyders terrible making in game adjustments. Team sucks right now. How many losses in the last 2 weeks? Too damn many. Awful@utahjazz Don’t 😬 us@NostalgicSteeze Every sport game was crazy today 😭 @warriors @utahjazzso close 😬

That ending…..sigh #utahjazzI hate the @utahjazzThat Bogey 3 was more than halfway down. 🤯 #UtahJazz #JazzNationThe @warriors (34-13) only manage 11 pts in the 4th quarter, but big defensive stops allow them to escape with a W over the @utahjazz 94-92. Poole led #dubnation with 20pts. Six players in double figures Curry, Lee, Looney, Poole, Porter Jr and Wiggins.DAMN IT 😫😫😫

#utahjazz@Darcy_Lynne As a Utah Jazz fan, I went through the same thing with Michael Jordan.@utahjazz @pura Play defense.@DustinT_NBA @hansenjames But if Rudy is helping at the rim, there isn't sufficient "help" (or responsibility) on the perimeter. 

Just ask Terrence Mann, version early 2021.

The other Jazzmen shouldn't expect to have a center camping in the paint to bail them out.
