He played 562 games in his career for the Nets.@ColinCowherd @BrooklynNets NBA has been DEAD for years… media is only realizing this now?@DurgoatB @NycStann @smkNitro @BrooklynNets @HSpecialSurgery I think that would make it a bit obvious he’s scaredIn case you missed the Celtics victory over the Brooklyn Nets check out this recap. @Akeem802 @thePeachBasket_ 
#nba #Celtics #Nets https://t.co/Hgb2Bpm957@mrgregshields @TheWizWit @dmay706 That’s my point, there’s no leadership in Brooklyn, people just forget that Kyrie left the Nets last season without a word, Nash didn’t even know where he was, that’s not cool. And Harden played more games than both Kyrie and KD as a Net, that’s crazy!I will be watching with interest tonight’s #Nets game 😂 BS in his #Brooklyn debut 🏀 #NBA@BrooklynNets Can’t you just take the lose and skip this game..This is just going to be waste of emotionsWho do YOU want the Brooklyn Nets start tonight against the Milwaukee Bucks?? ⬇️⬇️@BrooklynNets KD will forever be remembered by his rings he won in GSW. With Curry’s help. 

He’ll never win a ring with Kyrie, Ben and the rest of the “ramp up roster”@BrooklynNets @HSpecialSurgery KD really left a winning mentality, do whatever it takes in GSW  to a “we just wanna play ball for fun and don’t care about winning” in Brooklyn. 

At least his legacy was somewhat saved by Golden state.@RealCodyMallory @BrooklynNets hire this man as our coach@AleFacciaa @BrooklynNets @HSpecialSurgery It’s because the NBA coddles players too much and basically let them do whatever they want. 

(Decide when they wanna play or not) 
(decide whether or not they wanna leave their team even though they’re under contract) 

The nba is becoming a joke.Nets at Bucks: Prediction, point spread, odds, over/under, betting picks #Brooklyn #Nets #NBA https://t.co/RJQbXbK4V8@NycStann @BrooklynNets @HSpecialSurgery So why avoid every other game leading up to then? 

If I’m Brooklyn I’m pissed. Harden will most definitely play against Brooklyn. Why is Ben being such a baby.@Dj10833227 @SadNetsSaveUsBG @BrooklynNets @HSpecialSurgery Don’t hold your breath@mac7823 @BrooklynNets @HSpecialSurgery At this rate they’re gonna fall below a play in spot, get KD, Kyrie and Ben back desperately trying to get back in the race, only to realize it’s too late and they f*cked up. 

The Nets organization and the NBA injury protocols overall is just a giant joke.@KDTrey5 @KyrieIrving @BrooklynNets Hard working on tonight!I think your so batter!💪💪💪🙏🙏🙏👍@MelloSlime @kouten_mike @BrooklynNets @HSpecialSurgery They’re acting like Ben wasn’t playing any basketball in-between his trade from Philly to Nets. 

It these guys need to “ramp up conditioning” for months on end for a non injury related issue then I can only imagine Zion will be “ramping up conditioning” for years when he returns@NateToChina @NycStann @smkNitro @BrooklynNets @HSpecialSurgery Hurt with what? A tight hamstring? 

Has bro never heard of stretching? Dude missed like 3 weeks 💀@IceManStudios @DaneMooreNBA Jarrett Allen was scraped constantly as a Net. He didn't get those calls until Durant arrived. Caris LeVert was the same story. Brooklyn was mid market then suddenly stars came here and we got the calls.@ColinCowherd @BrooklynNets The #lakers didn’t crack the top ten…@BrooklynNets @HSpecialSurgery “Return to competition conditioning” 

Wtf does that even mean? Was drag if just sitting on his couch eating chips the entire time up until he got picked up by the nets?@BrooklynNets This is what makes the NBA unbearable to watch. The smallest injury of unconvinced to a player turns into a 6 month hiatus from the game. 

KD, Simmons, Kyrie, and Dragic have barely played this season. Simply because they’re not “conditioned enough” smh.@danfavale @HardwoodKnocks 😂😂😂😂😂

I love this article
Very creative and funny

Brooklyn Nets: Unknowable

😭😭😭😭😭@NycStann @smkNitro @BrooklynNets @HSpecialSurgery I think he meant dragic@NoahFer39948346 @KAscuasiati @BrooklynNets Read the picture again. 

He’s making fun of the fact that 4/5 of those players aren’t injured but somehow need to “ramp up conditioning” before playing. 

I thought these were pro NBA players not little peewee program basketball kids who need direction every second.@KDTrey5 @KyrieIrving @BrooklynNets I see a new BROOKLYN•NETS in NBA and everybody see our Nets so united ，this also fully confirms a sentence：“It's not insulting, but it's very hurtful!”that's why our Nets fans are happy about it. Thank you, Nets! https://t.co/NixezVljqw@BrooklynNets I guarantee “THE DRA9ON” won’t debut until the 2022-23 season.@NetsLink @HeroXYZero @CamConfidence Correct. If the Nets win the title with The Big 3, I couldn’t care less what happens thereafter – Harden could dip to Philly to hang with Meek, Kyrie could retire to think his thoughts, and KD could play ball in Brooklyn until he retires.@kendaily12 @SMC_Szn @BrooklynNets YA MANS KEPT IT EXTRA TALL💪💪 IMMA FOLLOW YOU JUST BECAUSE 🤣@JDoc311 @SauceGodSwag1 @Keyriosxty1 @JayLGK @BrooklynNets Stop@espn This will be the fourth of a six-game homestand for Mike Budenholzer's side.

That's the best the pick can be if the Nets make the playoffs.@BrooklynNets ain’t ready for us! @sixers #HereTheyCome https://t.co/kDSe2RbUMaJames Harden has an amazing debut for the Philadelphia 76ers

@BrooklynNets https://t.co/i0ImdSKeqC@ColinCowherd @BrooklynNets Is basketball popular? I don’t know anyone that watches it.@RealSkipBayless I don’t skip:  the houston situation was a rebuild and they were going to move him but moving slowly.  They got a good haul for him from Nets.  And then it was Kyrie.  Kyrie is a nutcase.  So he wanted out of Brooklyn.  But situations are understandable4Russell Westbrook, Point Guard, Los Angeles Lakers, $44,211,146

5Kevin Durant, Power Forward, Brooklyn Nets, $42,018,900

6LeBron James, Small Forward, Los Angeles Lakers, $41,180,544

7Giannis Anteokounmpo, Power Forward, Milwaukee Bucks, $39,344, 970These are currently the top 10 NBA players based on their salary.

1Steph Curry, Point Guard, Golden State Warriors: $45,780,966

2James Harden, Shooting Guard, Brooklyn Nets, $44,310,840

3John Wall, Point Guard, Houston Rockets, $44,310,840Early days for sure but I always abide by the "better head on their shoulders doctrine": if choice A is a party boy who shows up when it matters and B is a overrated malcontent who can't accept his faults and just quit, go with A. 🤔😜

#NBA  🏀 @NBA @sixers @BrooklynNetsJames Harden Was Sabotaging The Brooklyn Nets ! Now All Of A Sudden He Playing Good ?! Y’all Ain’t Winning At Da Barclays Can’t Wait For Them To Play #LetKyriePlay #NBATwitter #NBA75Clippers are overloaded with wings once Kawhi/PG are back. Perfect team for the Nets to do a sign and trade of Claxton for. Bring Covington or Coffey or Kennard to Brooklyn and fill that wing holeHot hot hot hot hot hot take:

Despite both going through the play-in tourney, the 2022 NBA finals will be: the Los Angeles lakers vs. the Brooklyn Nets. 

When this happens, y’all better tell your friends to drop me a follow.@DurgoatB @JonathanV563 @BrooklynNets Twolves are actually damn good...put out the memphis team last night...wolves will make playoffs watch@PHI215329 Throw Thybulle on Steph and Green on Klay let Harden play point and Tobias and Embiid act as his offensive options and the Warriors don’t scare me 

Nets only scare me if they decide to play in New Jersey, if they play in gentrified Brooklyn I feel negative fear@MarkGre84321817 @BrooklynNets You really dont get it...this guy had full philly fan support...always...hes just the biggest baby you will ever see..he will not take a normal jump shot...you will see@SamHoweII @RealSkipBayless Brooklyn Nets fans = hurt boys y'all might (underscore) get a play in... 🤣🤣🤣 https://t.co/FMMixwSW2n@TheHoopCentral @BrooklynNets them mfs stole your whole flow 😂@hoops04301268 @MarkGre84321817 @BrooklynNets He is DEFINITELY not worth trading Harden for.  I don’t think any of us…even the few real supporters of his that are left…understand that move.  He wants to be a social media star, and he embarrasses easily.  Not great for his teammates who want to win.  Good luck to Durant.@hoops04301268 @MarkGre84321817 @BrooklynNets 20 drunk guys immediately after the game did that in a parking lot.  Ppl forget that he was already trying to distance himself from the team b/c the coaching staff showed more confidence in Maxey at PG during the playoffs last year.  The culmination was his game 7 debacle.Imagine thinking that the Philadelphia Sixers and Daryl Morey lost this trade with the Brooklyn Nets.... If you believe that you may believe in flat earth too@MarkGre84321817 @BrooklynNets Why?  Because the Sixers were fining him for every day he didn’t report to the team at first.  So he needed a good excuse, otherwise he’d have forfeited tens of millions in salary.  Our local media knew he was doing this immediately…the locker room knew he was doing it.Brooklyn Nets vs Milwaukee Bucks 2/26/22 NBA Picks &amp; Predictions: https://t.co/HuxHqSyzI0Thanks @BrooklynNets 😆

Neither one has ever won an NBA championship

Nobody on the 76ers team has ever won a championship

But Ben Simmons is in good company

Two players on the Brooklyn Nets what won championships

Kyrie Irving and Kevin DurantJust watched the highlights of @jharden13 &amp; clearly Kyrie &amp; the @BrooklynNets were the problem. Harden hasn't looked this good since his time with the Rockets.

It’s honestly just more interesting to talk about the results, the rumors, and the gossip on social media.@ColinCowherd @BrooklynNets Who wants to watch the Nets home games without Kyrie. They’re going to be in the play in and might go home even though they really don’t have home fans@BLCity5 It doesn’t matter what team is on top my favorite teams the Brooklyn nets will upset a lots of teams The race is not for the first is the one to endures to the end ofWe want Brooklyn @BrooklynNets #TTPThat Sixers team is a joke w/o the free throw line.

This season went off the rails and the exit was bad. But it's clear what he brings when things are rolling. He did it for the Nets tooI just watch the @nyknicks play and they are missing something ,i am a @BrooklynNets supporter all the way but my family are @nyknicks fansNow a Brooklyn Net btw https://t.co/17g4nAW3SM https://t.co/PF1oRjSpZ5The Heat were built to stop Scary-Hours Nets...Bam, Jimmy, PJ - 3 superstar-stoppers to stop 3 superstars. And they won't even need to do that now.
Brooklyn, Milwaukee, Chicago and Philly each have a better player than anyone Miami has - but no one is a tougher out than the Heat.After one game you can tell just how much James Harden didn’t want to be on the Brooklyn Nets. Bro just out there glowing. https://t.co/hNdRKq0CxqThank @BrooklynNets #heretheycome #playthesong ! @AnthonyLGarganoThe NBA’s Brooklyn Nets told a federal court in New York that Black locker room employees’ claims that they were terminated for speaking out about social justice and police brutality are unfounded.

Daryl Morey ripped off the Brooklyn Nets 🤣🤣🤣🤣Not a single Brooklyn Nets fan on Twitter.  The old man Beard is in excellent game shape, but the young Bum Benny still can't play?? Harden looks so locked in and ready to do everything he can to win and make everyone else better aswell.  He is leading already.@bleed_green_5 Nets really traded for a guy that doesn’t shoot the basketball 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 good luck Brooklyn@KAscuasiati @BrooklynNets Durant will always make that a cotneder.
