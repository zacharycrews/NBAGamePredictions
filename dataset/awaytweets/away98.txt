To view this bet or copy it https://t.co/xB0NbBBMwN https://t.co/afP9KBBbtw75 years ago today, the first game in league history was played between the New York Knickerbockers and the Toronto Huskies.

Today, the Knicks and the Toronto Raptors face off at MSG to celebrate the historic day 👏 #NBA75 https://t.co/k0aewTa9CQFun fact: 

On this day, Nov 1, 1946, the Big League Basketball (now NBA) had its first-ever game when the Toronto Huskies hosted the New York Knickerbockers. Game ended 66- 68 (NY won)

Tonight, the NY Knicks host the Toronto Raptors. https://t.co/5ICFlXRsn0Little do folks know, in 1946 the first NBA game was played.

NY Knicks vs Toronto Raptors.

They really should be playing this game in Toronto for the 75th anniversary :( https://t.co/ueEnPnidqeADD:
