Today, the Knicks and the Toronto Raptors face off at MSG to celebrate the historic day üëè #NBA75 https://t.co/k0aewTa9CQFun fact: 

On this day, Nov 1, 1946, the Big League Basketball (now NBA) had its first-ever game when the Toronto Huskies hosted the New York Knickerbockers. Game ended 66- 68 (NY won)

Tonight, the NY Knicks host the Toronto Raptors. https://t.co/5ICFlXRsn0Little do folks know, in 1946 the first NBA game was played.
