Every death brings a renewal! The phoenix is an immortal bird associated with Greek mythology that cyclically regenerates or is otherwise born again. Associated with the sun, a phoenix obtains new life by arising from the ashes of its predecessor. https://t.co/7FPRm8zmT7And just remember you can still catch our previous interviews with Phoenix Suns general manager James Jones and LA Clippers swingman Terance Mann by clicking the link below.

Warriors game on xmas.The @BrooklynNets continue to sit atop the east, but the @Bucks are not far behind. Out west, the @Suns finally take over, relegating the @warriors to runners-up while the surging @utahjazz look to make it a 3-team affair! 📈 

Which teams will move up in Week 9? 🤔
