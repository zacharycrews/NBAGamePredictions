Jb needs to be more consistent but he is second option and has to maximize his skills passing since hes guard. They need a center like jokic to win@HoopsEmpire_ @NBA @celtics @NBATV The thing is we can say that but one attempts more threes giving there play styles are different.jb has a d wade slash and mid range with clutch threes.Jt is the mid range three shooter who can slash at will.But when we talking basketball jb was just consistency away from stardom@HoopsEmpire_ @NBA @celtics @NBATV and still defended the opposing star guard whenever it called for it. kobe too. players arent voting for guys to win awards and the media isnt gonna just ignore everyone they look at analytics too and try to pick good defenders at weak spots.brown and tatum equal if anything@HoopsEmpire_ @NBA @celtics @NBATV My stance on defense doesnt change because the moments show when players go at eachother. Why do you think fans was mad lebron wouldnt defend durant in the finals? If you saying hes doing offensive duties, Michael jordan hasnt played in any finals with another 20ppg scorer.@HoopsEmpire_ @NBA @celtics @NBATV i know i seen it now take into account possessions on star players. jokic is a leader in almost every major analytical stat category but is he a better defender than giannis and kawhi no.
