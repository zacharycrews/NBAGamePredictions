Drummond Claxton and Aldridge are enough to beat the Bucks in the paint although Giannis is a lot better than all 3 of them. They just have to make it hard for him they can't stop him lol.

Bucks as a team know what it takes to win. Giannis has more impact on both sides of the court over KD, and Nets somehow have less depth than last year?

https://t.co/UGMnGioaZ3Melo will be a Knick or Brooklyn Net next year.Bold take: The Brooklyn Nets will get eliminated next. 
Everyone will blame Kyrie for it, even though he's been balling in most of the games he has played. 
Their problem is their defense. 

I do hope they qualify though.Another incredible milestone in the East. Who would’ve thought the @Raptors would SECURE a playoff spot, while the @BrooklynNets are in the play in &amp; the @nyknicks are out of the playoffs.

#BrooklynNets #NetsWorld8 straight points for @KyrieIrving 😤 https://t.co/g5ZwLRcbmXThe limited bad news from Orlando beating Cleveland is that it puts the Nets within a game of the Cavs, and they play in Brooklyn on Friday. 

That said, raising the HOU pick floor is a bigger priority. Also, don't underestimate the power of a Caris LeVert revenge game@BrooklynNets bring back the cool black/grey/Basquiat uniforms.@HeatvsHaters Miami Heat have a better coaching staff then the Brooklyn Nets but for some odd reason people still pick the nets over Miami@KaisVaccine @BrooklynNets as long as they’re going down i’m good with it lol@jrharde @KaisVaccine @BrooklynNets Harden a sellout@jrharde @ShortyGlo18 @BrooklynNets Y’all lost by 10 to the pistons with harden.@notjmorant @BrooklynNets He stay getting cooked on the defensive end and it’s killing me@BrooklynNets Patty's been horrific.

If all teams keep their lead Brooklyn moves up to 8th and game behind 7thIf I were an NBA Eastern Conf team, I'd want to avoid the 1st or 2d seed...
Not because I'd be worried about the @BrooklynNets (who are a mess and can't play defense). I'd be worried about the @ATLHawks, who have gotten hot at the right time, just like last year's playoffs.Follow up:
How many of the @BrooklynNets losses could have been WINS if this arrogant ignorant diva @KyrieIrving had played in those games?!
As gifted an athlete he may be his inflated view of himself &amp; his perceived platform hold him back from being a true positive force!@Wallyto__ @BrooklynNets I hope no but he will always be better than james johnson so why not mdrrBulls are for me personally more of a what-if story than Brooklyn. We´ve already seen them healthy and performing their A-game. Nets just looking for excuses. #MILvsCHII get on the Nets for their defense but the Bulls match them.  They don't turn the ball over as much as Brooklyn does so it's not as bad but if you move the ball, you'll get an easy shot.@maroitoje hope you’re enjoying the @BrooklynNets game!
