#TrueToAtlanta business time
#NBA #soccer #pythonprogramming #bitcoinsI think that the Charlotte Hornets path to the playoffs will involve beating the Cleveland Cavaliers and the Atlanta Hawks. 

If they’re going to play Cleveland, might as well go all out for the three way tiebreaker so they can be the 8th seed.@Hawksdott Hey @ATLHawks, can you see this Brazilian Trap? This man is so "Brabo". Put this song in the Coach's timeout when we play at A.

Simple reasoning here. Heat trying to get out injury free and don’t have anything to play for here with 1 seed locked up. Hawks with chances to move positions. They should get the win as the more motivated team. #TrueToAtlanta@ATLHawks Spud Webb@929TheGame @Bighugh53 @JohnFricke . Favor plz!! Next time Travis is on with you guys.

Certainly best PG in the East. 

Top 5 in points and assist since he was a rookie. # 2 total points. #1 total assist.

Most 40 point and 30/10 games in the league.

 Biggest ATL star since Dom Wilkens. Not trading Trae for anyone lol@_PuzzlePieceDad Ts Josh181 
Atlanta Hawks@ATLHawks Tree Rolands@nbarealist23 @tez_jet @balldontstop @TheRealJHair The Spurs had multiple Hall of famers and a Hall of Fame coach and system that had been built and proven for the previous 15 years. You cannot compare them to the Atlanta Hawks who had one great season.@NDONG77 @ATLHawks @skylarmays4 Knox is still occasionally useful as a 3rd stringer, he can have games where he drops 10+ and just plays solid overall as a catch&amp;shoot guy. 

If we were going to convert Rife, it would HAVE to be Lou who’s getting cut, since we already have like 4 PG’s on the roster.@Info_HoundOnly @ATLHawks @CapelaClint @AnnieFinberg Stubhub 🤷‍♂️@ATLHawks I’m gonna say that’s Dominique Wilkins https://t.co/2T4U8SXc4RHey There!

#NBA #betting #analytics #rich@rodboone I hate that Miami clinched first tonight. Now the Atlanta Hawks won’t get their best shot tomorrow night. Hurts the Hornets and their hopes of gaining a home game in play-in.@ATLHawks NIQUE@ATLHawks it’s damn part time for the front office of the Hawks to start publicly criticizing the @NBA for not recognizing @TheTraeYoung greatness. It’s BEYOND intentional at this point. Dude averaging basically 30pts and 10 dimes. https://t.co/WpPXLcp1ja@ATLHawks @skylarmays4 Congrats @skylarmays4!
