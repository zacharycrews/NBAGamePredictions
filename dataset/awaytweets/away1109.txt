But let's talk about the Bucks. They  had Ferdinand Lewis Alcindor Jr. who ditched after 1 ring. The ice man was amazing but it seems like the only time he's brought up is when we talk about Russel Westbrook.Last year's champs Milwaukee Bucks lost 3 straight games March 26-29 and again April 6-9.

The previous year, the Lakers lost 3 straight in bubble tune-up games ahead of the playoffs.

It's not unprecedented.  Championship teams overcome adversity.  Can Miami?@OmarKin01119481 @GrizzliesPR @memgrizz @Bucks Yea and those dudes can hardly walk while you've got 37 year olds dunking in the league now.
