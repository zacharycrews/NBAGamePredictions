(+)I know they get beat a ton but I like this Orlando Magic team so much more than the playoff team with Vuc &amp; Fournier. 1st round of the playoffs was their ceiling‚Ä¶ this team - the sky is the limit‚Ä¶And I thought the Orlando Magic were trash... https://t.co/rQDQa4BSktFrom the Magic Kingdom to magical spa treatments, Orlando sparkles with the promise of adventure.

One of the more overrated players of this era in my honest opinion.@OrlandoMagic @The_ColeAnthony @NBA2K Based on the name below, that is Cole Anthony@SomosMagic @6toHombreLATAM @OrlandoMagic 1.

The @OrlandoMagic are 23 games into the season with a 5-18 record. @CEEjAY1911 writes about some positive aspects that he is already taking away just a quarter way into the season.

Jalen Suggs should've gone top 3 in the current draft

But orlando got him at 5
One of the top 3 players
In a top 4 draft
And orlando got him at the 5th pick

That was the same day my parents had gotten tickets for a David Copperfield magic show at the Bob Carr in Orlando, so i got taken out of school early that day, a little after the explosion, to get to the theater on time.@OrlandoMagic yessirr tross wearing his merch  lmaoI am usually a vendor at an event here called Pagans in the Park, which is once every 2 months, but it keeps getting delayed.
