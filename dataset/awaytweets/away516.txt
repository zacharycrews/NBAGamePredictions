When it gets warm and back in NBA Playoffs( spring)... the world of basketball will be here. Your profile should explode.2003-2010 Cleveland Cavaliers
2010-2014 Miami Heat
2014-2018 Cleveland Cavaliers
2018-Present Los Angeles Lakers

All these teams he‚Äôs been on he has won an NBA Title at least once.

Happy Birthday King https://t.co/Bz7uukHkMYI'm not completely against the @cavs going after Ben Simmons or John Wall.  I also wouldn't mind just going after a cheaper option.  What is Jeff Teague doing these days?Ricky Rubio of the Cleveland Cavaliers has a torn ACL in his left knee and will miss the rest of the season.
