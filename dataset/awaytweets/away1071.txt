I'd only sue if he didn't sign the cast 😂@bosnianbeast27 @trailblazers I'm a huge fan of yours &amp; I've been a Blazers fan &amp; supporter since the late 80's, but I can't support that weak move of confronting a kid a third of your size &amp; then taking his personal property &amp; damaging it!!!  I hope you found it in you to at the very least replace his phone! https://t.co/yiAqNLKDoT@D_Naids @bosnianbeast27 @trailblazers @CoachGeskeZCHS I don’t think he owes the little f*** anything. Lolol@MTursunovic41 @bosnianbeast27 @trailblazers If you pay attention, see the kid behind this picture? That’s the kid that pissed Nurk off and got his phone thrown away@D_Naids @bosnianbeast27 @trailblazers @CoachGeskeZCHS You about to ban him yourself? “Better hurry” you high man?@bosnianbeast27 @trailblazers Thug@bosnianbeast27 @trailblazers Class act with that kid, throwing his phone. Hope you have a great breakfast with Mrs nba fine tomorrow! Btw even when you’re injured, you get steals. Life is full of mystery… or like Chewbacca would say: JEDKDKDKDKDDNSNX.@bosnianbeast27 looking like a real b**ch trying to intimidate someone that much smaller 🤣 

Never ever seen him with this kinda energy to someone he’s guarding… ever 🤷‍♂️ 

@trailblazers need to find a legit big man for Dame cuz this guy ain’t it

Dude, no one watches the Blazers, that’s why they haven’t won since ‘77, small market.
If “very well” is averaging 12 points, that says a lot about Blazers. There’s a reason dudes bounce around the league,they stink@trailblazers Exemplary behavior by your boy here https://t.co/uLHelYYfqR@ChasingMyCROWN_ NBA Playoffs 2000.

But some people wouldn’t take that@AquaJay29 @MTursunovic41 @bosnianbeast27 @trailblazers Maybe. But I’m not playing. I don’t care about that kid or the Blazers. Didn’t watch the game, don’t care. Not sure how I’m crying. We won I see and it wasn’t my phone. I just think he should get some sort of disciplinary action. If he took the wrong phone, things could go badEncerrado:

They’re evaluated everyday by doctors and physicians. You’re clearly still a casual.Our oldest is 13! We had a great day celebrating and going to our first NBA game.

#trailblazers #portlandtrailblazers #pacers #thirteenthbirthday @ Gainbridge Fieldhouse https://t.co/P8CJZsULsD@HMagerstein @bosnianbeast27 @trailblazers Casual once again. Winslow has been play very well for the Blazers when he hasn’t been sitting with “Achilles soreness”. Bledsoe is 100% better than Keon Johnson, Kelvin Blevins, and Elijah Hughes. It’s okay to admit you don’t watch the Blazers. It’s a safe place my guy@PinwheelEmpire What does that God forsaken city have to do with the PORTLAND Trail Blazers?@Patbooker18 @bobano @trailblazers should be suspendedVideo Shows Jusuf Nurkic Throwing Pacers Fan’s Phone: Photo by Justin Ford/Getty Images

My guy, the only casual sounding fella here is you.@MTursunovic41 @bosnianbeast27 @trailblazers Bosnianbitch27 should get suspended. The guy called the blazers garbage. Truth hurts bro.@m1chael__acosta @bosnianbeast27 @trailblazers Hahaha if you are tanking, you’d be playing Winslow and Bledsoe, they are ass!@goatsimons @trailblazers We’re tanking lmaoCongratulations to matman_810 who moved up 26 spots to take #14 on the Portland Trail Blazers team leaderboard.

https://t.co/RFAYArDmriThat’s f_cked up. That’s not a way to treat a fan… worse of all, a kid, Nurkic. 

Great time we are living: NBA players acting as the bully.

They’re tanking. None of these guys have real injuries at this point. Dames surgery was 4-6 weeks to get back to playing. It’s been 9 weeks now. Just admit you’re a sorry casual.@MTursunovic41 @bosnianbeast27 @trailblazers Act like a grown man maybe. Control your kid maybe. Either is acceptable.The @NBA @trailblazers need to fine Jusuf Nurkić. He came ACROSS the floor to damage property which is a crime. https://t.co/whtI6WggZt@m1chael__acosta @bosnianbeast27 @trailblazers Yeah, definitely not the plantar fascia injury… The tanking excuse also explains his inability to play a full season during his time in PortlandTotally spaced that it was Portland in town till we saw one of our favorites, @brookeolzendam after the game.

Still nice as ever. So happy for her chance with the @trailblazers, great fit.

Love that city, we'll try and visit next season.  Currently I'm 0-2 in Moda so...@jrflyone @bosnianbeast27 @trailblazers After that kid was haggling / calling him names.
