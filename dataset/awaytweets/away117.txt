Pelicans are playing B2B games on a west coast road trip. They are currently the worse team in the NBA and lost last night as +10 favs by 12.

I believe this is a solid spot for them so we playing it. Thanks!GSN-Video of injured New Orleans Pelicans star Zion Williamson working out a healing broken foot became fodder for retired NBA stars Charles Barkley and Shaquille O’Neal Tuesday night, as the “Inside the NBA” analysts roasted the 21-year-old. https://t.co/Q51YjIDhIp@PCGreenfield @JoeGoodmanJr Lived in New Orleans from birth through high school, never went to one game. I like basketball too, just don’t care about the Pelicans and neither does the rest of the city.It’s unclear when Zion Williamson will be back in the lineup for the New Orleans Pelicans. Based on Saturday night’s video, it could be a while. https://t.co/agkV6W5RBh🏀 #NBA
