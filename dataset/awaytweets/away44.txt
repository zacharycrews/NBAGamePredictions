If you have to choose one, please ditch the WFT coverage for the Wizards please. The WFT is and will be a dumpster fire for the foreseeable future.With a win vs. the Brooklyn Nets tonight, the Wizards would start the season 3-0 for the first time since 2017-18. 

Additionally, this would mark just the fourth time since the NBA/ABA merger Washington will have started a season 3-0 (2017-18, 2005-06, 1978-79).#Washington #Wizards: The moments that really matter!...
