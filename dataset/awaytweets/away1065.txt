Gotta find that. #TakeNote https://t.co/Z9miOggeLZ@utahjazz I sometimes think we don't deserve @spidadmitchell@katetscott @kristablunk @utahjazz she was awesome, would love to see her calling for a team full time@uhvoyd Would you like to play for the Utah jazz gaming team??@utahjazz AmazingKarl Malone of @utahjazz fame is to the NBA what RKelly is to the music industry. Except I never found it factual he had fathered a set of twins with a TWELVE YEAR OLD and left them all high and dry.

Glad @KingJames kicked his can farther down the list. Fuck a phony  ass mailman@BillieJeanKing @utahjazz @kristablunk @sportsiren @NatWillBBall @kristenkoz32 @JenniferAzzi @nayocampbell Why no congrats to @kristenkenney too? Oh that's right...3/19/10 – Amar'e Stoudemire scored a season-high 44p (w/7r) as the Phoenix #Suns maintained a double-digit lead throughout the 2nd half en route to a 110-100 win over the Utah Jazz, whom they were fighting for playoffs home court. Lopez: 19p/10r. Nash: 15p/10a. #ValleyProud https://t.co/OXKuvTLRHXICYMI: An all-female broadcast team called the action for the first time ever during a @utahjazz game.

“My hope is that this one game won’t just be one game."

We were season ticket holders when we lived out west a few years ago. I honestly think this is the first time I’ve gone to see them in enemy territory. It’s going to be a blast! #takenoteCongratulations to gojazzgo who moved up 42 spots to take #12 on the Utah Jazz team leaderboard.

https://t.co/CDr6eP2Ai1Thanks for playing, @emilyy_32 🤣Anyone catch the friendly match of rock, paper, scissors going on last night? ✂️📄 https://t.co/xxojTFSw4Q@NFL @Titans Titans are the Utah Jazz of the NFL.@utahjazz @sportsiren @nayocampbell @kristablunk @kristenkoz32 @ATTSportsNetRM They did an amazing job. These ladies know their stuff.@kristenkoz32 @sportsiren @utahjazz @LAClippers You ladies did an amazing job last night. What a pleasure to watch!@BillieJeanKing @utahjazz @kristablunk @sportsiren @NatWillBBall @kristenkoz32 @JenniferAzzi @nayocampbell They did an awesome job. These ladies know their stuff.Much more from @sportssiren with @tvheidihatch one on one— Utah’s female sports role model— a hometown hero on @KUTV2News at 10. @utahjazz https://t.co/NB257A0FCN@Tjonesonthenba So much talent that he sits on the end of the bench #LetButlerPlayMore #UtahJazz #Takenote@MorganWolfeKSL @utahjazz @NBA @sportsiren @kristablunk How is this not seen as pandering to women and misogynistic? Don't women feel like it's condescending to be selected for a job, merely because of what their sex is?  If it's for womens day, fine. But the best should always-out. Replacing misogyny with misogyny won't fix shit.@utahjazz Good lord what happened to the team being healthy this year!!!1 lottery pick, 1 good trade and 1 good free agent signing from becoming utah jazz 👍 https://t.co/o9iChQjNuz@utahjazz @mconley11 ITS CONFIRMED! MIKE CONLEY ON THE JAZZ TIL HES 42 🙌🏻🙌🏻I hope the Utah Jazz get swept round 1. Matter fact I hope every game is a blowout. I hope their fans boo Donovan off the court too. I’ve never prayed on a franchise downfall as much I do theirs.
