With 6 games left, 4 could get their second win of the season against the Suns.

The Suns cannot lose a season series against ANY team this year. Worst case would be splitting 5.

Sensitive much fellas?

I’ll be laffin last.Somewhat significant if Utah blows it up:

The Jazz hold a slight edge over the Suns for the fourth-best all-time franchise winning percentage.

The Suns would overtake them if over the next three seasons Phoenix wins 60% of their games and Utah only wins 40%. https://t.co/hUwO8TSuLs https://t.co/u1rFOAs2Qq@TorreyCraigStan @Suns They hate us until we hoist that trophyShaquille O'Neal gets April Fools pranked about NBA's Top 10 greatest centers #Phoenix #Suns #NBA https://t.co/pFfHspPVhl@DylanCarey11 Hey @Suns Win something already 🤦🏻‍♂️ ⬇️😬 https://t.co/fb6xdW6Zgw@kirkgoldsberry @memgrizz @Suns @Timberwolves @celtics @Raptors @nyknicks @BrooklynNets @Bucks @Lakers @chicagobulls Raptors are essential a rebuilding team.

-Phoenix runs Elbow for Bridges
-Curry navigates Ayton's screen too wide and can't recover to Bridges who curls into the paint
-Looney is slightly delayed in covering this so OPJ is also forced to collapse further down
-Crowder misses an open corner 3 https://t.co/edn68fB3TxJust hit me that today marks a bit of an anniversary. It was 35 years ago that had my first day in this biz. Two stints at the Winnipeg Sun, a year at the Saskatoon Star-Phoenix and 17 years at the Freep before landing here with the Blue Bombers/Valour. Still loving it.Boston Celtics - Indiana Pacers

🕔 5PM
📺 @BALLYSPORTSAZ
📻 @AZSports |  @az_mejor https://t.co/tZbdoyUvwXThe Phoenix Suns have been the most dominant/best/complete team in the NBA all season long. 

Reminds me of a hungry 2012 Miami Heat team that wanted to win after losing in the finals the year before.

Booker is playing on another level this yr.

#ValleyProud #NBA75 #HEATCultureLowe Post podcast: ESPN's Suns guru/lifelong fan @SchwartzCenterM on Phoenix's historic dominance, Booker's MVP case, what this has been like for fans. Then @espn_macmahon and I on Giannis/MVP and the reeling Jazz:

They r young, winning a lot, so have @Suns.   Suns W-L rec is 121 - 35 since their Bubble run in 2020.  48 - 0 W-L when leading after 3 Qtrs.  On their way to best Road rec too.

Diff makers this yr 4 @Suns is Javale, CamJ, and Landry Shamut@GrizzliesPR @memgrizz @Suns Memphis has a six game lead over Dallas and Golden State and are 8.5 games behind Phoenix.  Better to rest players before the playoffs than risk injuries in a meaningless game.@stephenasmith Stephen A., Giannis may be the most clutch player in the game still today. Milwaukee has just beaten Philly and Brooklyn. And I know Phoenix is very good but don’t forget Milwaukee is the defending champs and beat the Suns in the Finals last season. Good NBA season@TorreyCraigStan @Suns we can’t have anything man 🤣@NBA @Suns @Mike29461 they’re winning it all@Plugss_ @GrizzliesPR @memgrizz @Suns They needed to beat them so they can try and have LA higher in draft order so they get their pick instead of the pelicans@officialA_cube It's quite the opposite, the east is stronger this year and the only team out of the west that might challenge them is the same one they played in the finals last year.

Not even comparable to Giannis. 

You can argue that the @Suns aren’t even the best the team. They play in a much weaker conference. 10 teams in the East are over .500 only 7 in the West. https://t.co/bR9mxjiq77That Bucks vs Nets game was incredible and it makes me feel good about my feelings all season long. The Phoenix Suns and the Milwaukee Bucks are still the best two teams in the NBA. Would love nothing more than an NBA FINALS Rematch between these two great teams.

If you were going to buy a franchise today and it wasn't based on location then you would purchase the Grizz.@Suns @mikal_bridges hands down@ColemanESPN living in Phoenix? There's alot of the Suns fan base that does not like Booker. I read the comments from the Sports Center tweets. Fans that live in Arizona often say it. I don't care for his immaturity.

Last night vs Warriors, he missed 11 more shots (5-16, 2-8 3s) &amp; has 725 missed shots in only 65 games.👎🏾 
It's good thing for no DBook shooting bricks @Suns &amp; not Lakers. 🤔@Plugss_ @GrizzliesPR @memgrizz @Suns Because we wanted to win the southwest divisionThe Phoenix Suns might be getting back a couple of key bench pieces for Friday night's game against the Grizzlies in Memphis.
