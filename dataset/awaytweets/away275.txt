📲💻: Watch live now on League Pass: https://t.co/RJlQCgJe1C https://t.co/wKbLvjT8wL@MoneyManagment1 to answer your question, i dont really like fckn with Utah Jazz for now, but against OKC Thunder, 11-15 value bet. Thunder been covering big spreads against elite teams but Utah Jazz can be savage and still cover. But a spot at 12-14 maybe.@keepfischin @CryptoPapi10 @apocalypsebiker @nateshinkle @rudygobert27 @utahjazz @nbatopshot Okay, thank you so much for the info !!!!While losing is part of sports, for Utah Jazz fans, the most frustrating part of it all might be that the team is losing due to the same old issues both Quin Snyder and the players have acknowledged need to be fixed. So why can’t the Jazz fix the issues? https://t.co/JSO6hRgD9H@Miiggyx @CryptoPapi10 @apocalypsebiker @nateshinkle @rudygobert27 @utahjazz @nbatopshot It's an extremely risky and volatile asset, and definitely only spend what you're willing to lose. But the technology is really fun and interesting and there are some fantastic communities!@Miiggyx @CryptoPapi10 @apocalypsebiker @nateshinkle @rudygobert27 @utahjazz There's a broad range. The most popular chain, ethereum, would probably cost a few hundred dollars in most cases. But other less popular chains have interesting art for less. If you're into sports, the cheapest Moments on @nbatopshot start at $3....And this is why nobody picks the Utah Jazz in NBA2K... https://t.co/ViLyMot5FATo say that @J_Hooper11's transition from college to the @NBA has been difficult would be an understatement. “It’s so hard,” Butler said. “Just every single part of it has been hard.” | By @NBASarah #utahjazz

Could any of you explain just what it means for the @slcstars to have drafted Zaire Wade?

Will he just be available next year in an open NBA draft? Or do the Jazz have first option with him?

Thanks!@utahjazz Done and done!@CryptoPapi10 @apocalypsebiker @nateshinkle @rudygobert27 @utahjazz oh i see, that's so cool, thank you so much !!
How much money do you think someone need to start investing in nft ?@nateshinkle @Miiggyx @apocalypsebiker @rudygobert27 @utahjazz No, that would be fortnite. In my case I own the chicken, the chicken has attributes that can make it great at the game or terrible too. The best chickens will be worth a lot because they have a high probability of paying out in the game.@nateshinkle @twistophe_c @rudygobert27 @utahjazz Bud you are so ngmi its sad, go back to bed@Miiggyx @apocalypsebiker @nateshinkle @rudygobert27 @utahjazz absolutely. Every collection is different. I bought NFT chickens that I can actually race in a video game, and if my chickens win I make money. I use this example because it's easy to wrap your head around. This is real utility from an NFT collection

Is there other benefit from buying nft than selling them at a higher price and enjoying collecting them ?@paDEVul13 @CryptoPapi10 @apocalypsebiker @nateshinkle @rudygobert27 @utahjazz The token is bought and sold many times and the group(BAYC) earns royalties from these sales, merchandise, other revenue streams. sometimes directly paid back to owners.

That was the 11th time he has made that many. In last 5 games, he’s had gms of 26, 27, and 24 and made 21 of his last 41 threes!

We should lobby governments across the global to support sustainable energy methods rather than allowing them to get off by pointing fingers at citizens and industries and yelling “their fault!”I think @spidadmitchell breaks out in a big way tonight vs Thunder.

https://t.co/uNEvvdjWvR@nateshinkle @twistophe_c @rudygobert27 @utahjazz Have you actually done any research on the actual value that the token gives to the holders or are you assuming?@yarramishog @utahjazz @spidadmitchell Let’s make it happen!!@nateshinkle @carmastrikes @Halberstram_ @rudygobert27 @utahjazz I get it sir. You don’t.

If i priced an ape verified on blockchain at the floor it would sell quickly at around $190,000. 

“Ridiculous concepts” 😂@pitpanther01 @carmastrikes @Halberstram_ @rudygobert27 @utahjazz i don’t think you get it, i’m not trying to sell an image of a digital monkey to anyone because it is a ridiculous concept there is no artistic value@newbie_27 @twistophe_c @rudygobert27 @utahjazz and you saying the token has value doesn’t make any sense@nateshinkle @apocalypsebiker @CryptoPapi10 @rudygobert27 @utahjazz Tell me you know nothing about NFTs without telling me you know nothing about NFTs@EcsZed @rudygobert27 @utahjazz i am 16 years old in this picture, please find something better to do with your life@carmastrikes @nateshinkle @Halberstram_ @rudygobert27 @utahjazz Okay. If I can’t verify it then please go ahead and take this image and sell it. Why wouldnt you?@nateshinkle @twistophe_c @rudygobert27 @utahjazz Oh so you’re saying some numbers with no actual utility or community backing them are not the same as real money? Interesting…@pitpanther01 @nateshinkle @Halberstram_ @rudygobert27 @utahjazz No you cannot. The NFT is a token on the blockchain completely unrelated by code, tag, or any other technical method to the image in question. As far as your computer is concerned, every single copy of that image is the same jpeg or png, barring compression and losses.@protect_men @TreSumMusic @Hak88mNicks @ClutchPointsApp Phoenix Suns 93" record 62-20/ Chicago Bulls record 57-25
Utah Jazz 98' record 62-20/Chicago Bulls 98' record 62-20

No, the Bulls weren't the favorite every year. They were the better team in 97'. Wrong year.@EcsZed @nateshinkle @rudygobert27 @utahjazz Wearing a Coldplay t shirt is actually more of a crime@Raptors vs. @memgrizz

This is a story worth reading and enjoying if you’re a Bulls fan who recalls where they were when they saw The Shot in real time. I was sitting amidst a bunch of over confident Jazz fans.

[via r/nba Nov 24, 2014 #NBA]All games have been played on Nov. 23, 2021.

The Portland Trail Blazers are 10-8 and are currently the No. 6 seed in the West

If the playoffs started today, they would face the No. 3 Utah Jazz in the first round of the playoffs #RipCity@CryptoPapi10 @apocalypsebiker @nateshinkle @rudygobert27 @utahjazz Sincere question- I get the community piece, but where does the passive income come from? I had assumed the only income would be when you sell it for a higher amount than you purchased.And John Stockton sends the Utah Jazz to the NBA finals…. https://t.co/VA49Ru9vSwUtah Jazz vs. Oklahoma City Thunder - 11/24/2021 Free Pick &amp; NBA Betting Prediction https://t.co/5dAXS9LySq

Thank you @Utah_Football @realsaltlake @UtahMBB @utahjazz@nateshinkle @apocalypsebiker @CryptoPapi10 @rudygobert27 @utahjazz Do you buy your groceries with whatever pictures you have hanging in your bedroom? Walls? Do you swipe your tv for gas?? Not the same thing at all lol@utahjazz @quartersnacks this you?@utahjazz @TryHomie My cousin, he is a huge jazz fan and his dad just passed away last week. Please it would mean so much to their family. 🙏🏼

https://t.co/maNY1FhVh4Somehow, some way that I will never be able to comprehend. 

The 2021 Utah Jazz and 2021 Real Salt Lake both made it to the Conference Semifinals. 

Make it make sense.@nateshinkle @rudygobert27 @utahjazz When you see a brother that hates money https://t.co/xgrBdkgdR9@GarrettDespain @apocalypsebiker @CryptoPapi10 @rudygobert27 @utahjazz i’m not going to buy my groceries with a fraction of a picture of an ape, and what holds that value besides you saying blockchain does?@apocalypsebiker @CryptoPapi10 @nateshinkle @rudygobert27 @utahjazz Do you value the USD? If so, what’s attached to it? Besides trillions of debt??@CryptoPapi10 @nateshinkle @rudygobert27 @utahjazz And then I'll be able to tell who paid $50k for a cartoon ape?@twistophe_c @rudygobert27 @utahjazz those are just numbers you tweeted i can’t sell those unless i trick someone into thinking they are worth something and buying them@nateshinkle @rudygobert27 @utahjazz how embarrassing recycling this overused joke.@nateshinkle @rudygobert27 @utahjazz $1 000 000 

Copy the amount above. Free gift, you're welcome.@nateshinkle @rudygobert27 @utahjazz It’s blurry can you repost it again@apocalypsebiker @CryptoPapi10 @nateshinkle @rudygobert27 @utahjazz its kindve the opposite - the jpeg isnt relevant - only the token is - and yes the jpeg is permanently attached to the token but because the token is on the block chain it can never be lost however the web 2 jpeg data actually can be lost if its not on chain which most nfts arent@CryptoPapi10 @apocalypsebiker @rudygobert27 @utahjazz i don’t want your monkey token bro do you not get that@apocalypsebiker @nateshinkle @rudygobert27 @utahjazz If you go in my wallet you can see my token. Very soon twitter will turn on integration with wallets and you’ll see right in my profile pic that I own the token. At that point copying the jpg will be very obvious to you that it’s just a copy. If you seek to understand you will@nateshinkle @apocalypsebiker @CryptoPapi10 @rudygobert27 @utahjazz the bayc creators do not sell apes for 100k or more a piece only after market traders do so they really didnt scam anyone people are just buying this stuff lol@nateshinkle @apocalypsebiker @CryptoPapi10 @rudygobert27 @utahjazz the people who made BAYC only made mint price x 10000 im not sure how much mint was but im assuming like 0.05 eth or something but theyre not getting paid these high valuations for the apes - after market traders are because of supply vs demand@nateshinkle @rudygobert27 @utahjazz /2 people like feeling like they own “real” things, and then another thing to consider is how ownership of digital assets will evolve over time. more and more of life is digital, a Twitter blue check is more valuable than a copper rock or oz of gold in 2021. things to consider:)@nateshinkle @rudygobert27 @utahjazz Man if you bothered to read up, you would realise you’re kinda just clowning rn…@apocalypsebiker @nateshinkle @rudygobert27 @utahjazz The jpg can change. The token can’t. The token is valuable because it gives us access to a community. Passive income. Benefits and rewards that you don’t get when you have a jpg and not a token.@CryptoPapi10 @nateshinkle @rudygobert27 @utahjazz Basically you are saying this garbage drawing is worth money because it has computer code with it that no one can see and no one knows that your jpeg is any different from anyone else's jpeg of the same pic.@CryptoPapi10 @nateshinkle @rudygobert27 @utahjazz But the token is only valuable based on what it is attached to, right? You can't do anything else with the token, can you? It's permanently attached to the jpeg, right?@nateshinkle @apocalypsebiker @rudygobert27 @utahjazz It’s actually impossible for you to create the same token. That’s like me saying I’ll just clone your dna. Is that possible?@CryptoPapi10 @apocalypsebiker @rudygobert27 @utahjazz i’ll create the same token with the same jpg based on dogecoin then@apocalypsebiker @nateshinkle @rudygobert27 @utahjazz The value isn’t in the jpg. Which is why nobody will pay you for that jpg but they’ll pay me for my token. Which you don’t have.@nateshinkle @CryptoPapi10 @rudygobert27 @utahjazz Feel free. Mine is a screenshot of someone else's. Was just looking for crap nft examples.@apocalypsebiker @CryptoPapi10 @rudygobert27 @utahjazz this pic goes hard, mind if i screenshot?@nateshinkle @CryptoPapi10 @rudygobert27 @utahjazz Like why is it worth any more than this garbage nft drawing. They seem about the same to me. https://t.co/OseCo82wJy@apocalypsebiker @CryptoPapi10 @rudygobert27 @utahjazz i just can’t believe their scam is working, who ever owns the bored ape yacht club is a genius for getting so many people to think his jpegs are worth more than anyone else’sNominate a Jazz fan aged 18 or under who has their community’s back, and they could win the chance to raid a player’s locker! 

#LockerRoomRaid | @tryhomieThe much-maligned Portland Trail Blazers are 1.5 games behind the Utah Jazz.@nateshinkle @rudygobert27 @utahjazz Funny thing about this is how badly you’re just cheating yourself by not trying to understand them 🤣@nateshinkle @rudygobert27 @utahjazz alright, I can buy an exact print of the Mona Lisa at the louvre gift shop. Someone can fake Ruth’s signature to the point where you can’t tell. The point is that people like owning things@nateshinkle @Halberstram_ @rudygobert27 @utahjazz Well this one is pretty low quality compared to the og. Dude couldn’t even right click save properly@Halberstram_ @rudygobert27 @utahjazz show me a pixel difference between the two images@nateshinkle @rudygobert27 @utahjazz I personally am flattered that you like my ape so much.@CryptoPapi10 @rudygobert27 @utahjazz no i’m going to keep it and get mad at anyone who screenshots it@nateshinkle @rudygobert27 @utahjazz Please show it to all your friends.@protect_men @TreSumMusic @Hak88mNicks @ClutchPointsApp His team WAS NOT better than Utah Jazz 97'', Phoenix Suns 93', Seattle Supersonics 96', or the Utah Jazz 98'.
