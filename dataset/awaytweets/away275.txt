Thunder been covering big spreads against elite teams but Utah Jazz can be savage and still cover. But a spot at 12-14 maybe.@keepfischin @CryptoPapi10 @apocalypsebiker @nateshinkle @rudygobert27 @utahjazz @nbatopshot Okay, thank you so much for the info !!!!While losing is part of sports, for Utah Jazz fans, the most frustrating part of it all might be that the team is losing due to the same old issues both Quin Snyder and the players have acknowledged need to be fixed. So why can‚Äôt the Jazz fix the issues? https://t.co/JSO6hRgD9H@Miiggyx @CryptoPapi10 @apocalypsebiker @nateshinkle @rudygobert27 @utahjazz @nbatopshot It's an extremely risky and volatile asset, and definitely only spend what you're willing to lose.

How much money do you think someone need to start investing in nft ?@nateshinkle @Miiggyx @apocalypsebiker @rudygobert27 @utahjazz No, that would be fortnite.

The Portland Trail Blazers are 10-8 and are currently the No. 6 seed in the West

If the playoffs started today, they would face the No. 3 Utah Jazz in the first round of the playoffs #RipCity@CryptoPapi10 @apocalypsebiker @nateshinkle @rudygobert27 @utahjazz Sincere question- I get the community piece, but where does the passive income come from?

Besides trillions of debt??@CryptoPapi10 @nateshinkle @rudygobert27 @utahjazz And then I'll be able to tell who paid $50k for a cartoon ape?@twistophe_c @rudygobert27 @utahjazz those are just numbers you tweeted i can‚Äôt sell those unless i trick someone into thinking they are worth something and buying them@nateshinkle @rudygobert27 @utahjazz how embarrassing recycling this overused joke.@nateshinkle @rudygobert27 @utahjazz $1 000 000

Free gift, you're welcome.@nateshinkle @rudygobert27 @utahjazz It‚Äôs blurry can you repost it again@apocalypsebiker @CryptoPapi10 @nateshinkle @rudygobert27 @utahjazz its kindve the opposite - the jpeg isnt relevant - only the token is - and yes the jpeg is permanently attached to the token but because the token is on the block chain it can never be lost however the web 2 jpeg data actually can be lost if its not on chain which most nfts arent@CryptoPapi10 @apocalypsebiker @rudygobert27 @utahjazz i don‚Äôt want your monkey token bro do you not get that@apocalypsebiker @nateshinkle @rudygobert27 @utahjazz If you go in my wallet you can see my token. Very soon twitter will turn on integration with wallets and you‚Äôll see right in my profile pic that I own the token. At that point copying the jpg will be very obvious to you that it‚Äôs just a copy. If you seek to understand you will@nateshinkle @apocalypsebiker @CryptoPapi10 @rudygobert27 @utahjazz the bayc creators do not sell apes for 100k or more a piece only after market traders do so they really didnt scam anyone people are just buying this stuff lol@nateshinkle @apocalypsebiker @CryptoPapi10 @rudygobert27 @utahjazz the people who made BAYC only made mint price x 10000 im not sure how much mint was but im assuming like 0.05 eth or something but theyre not getting paid these high valuations for the apes - after market traders are because of supply vs demand@nateshinkle @rudygobert27 @utahjazz /2 people like feeling like they own ‚Äúreal‚Äù things, and then another thing to consider is how ownership of digital assets will evolve over time. more and more of life is digital, a Twitter blue check is more valuable than a copper rock or oz of gold in 2021. things to consider:)@nateshinkle @rudygobert27 @utahjazz Man if you bothered to read up, you would realise you‚Äôre kinda just clowning rn‚Ä¶@apocalypsebiker @nateshinkle @rudygobert27 @utahjazz The jpg can change. The token can‚Äôt. The token is valuable because it gives us access to a community. Passive income. Benefits and rewards that you don‚Äôt get when you have a jpg and not a token.@CryptoPapi10 @nateshinkle @rudygobert27 @utahjazz Basically you are saying this garbage drawing is worth money because it has computer code with it that no one can see and no one knows that your jpeg is any different from anyone else's jpeg of the same pic.@CryptoPapi10 @nateshinkle @rudygobert27 @utahjazz But the token is only valuable based on what it is attached to, right? You can't do anything else with the token, can you? It's permanently attached to the jpeg, right?@nateshinkle @apocalypsebiker @rudygobert27 @utahjazz It‚Äôs actually impossible for you to create the same token. That‚Äôs like me saying I‚Äôll just clone your dna. Is that possible?@CryptoPapi10 @apocalypsebiker @rudygobert27 @utahjazz i‚Äôll create the same token with the same jpg based on dogecoin then@apocalypsebiker @nateshinkle @rudygobert27 @utahjazz The value isn‚Äôt in the jpg. Which is why nobody will pay you for that jpg but they‚Äôll pay me for my token. Which you don‚Äôt have.@nateshinkle @CryptoPapi10 @rudygobert27 @utahjazz Feel free. Mine is a screenshot of someone else's. Was just looking for crap nft examples.@apocalypsebiker @CryptoPapi10 @rudygobert27 @utahjazz this pic goes hard, mind if i screenshot?@nateshinkle @CryptoPapi10 @rudygobert27 @utahjazz Like why is it worth any more than this garbage nft drawing. They seem about the same to me. https://t.co/OseCo82wJy@apocalypsebiker @CryptoPapi10 @rudygobert27 @utahjazz i just can‚Äôt believe their scam is working, who ever owns the bored ape yacht club is a genius for getting so many people to think his jpegs are worth more than anyone else‚ÄôsNominate a Jazz fan aged 18 or under who has their community‚Äôs back, and they could win the chance to raid a player‚Äôs locker!
