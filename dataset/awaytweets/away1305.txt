#フォロバUnpopular opinion: I like the Miami Heat to beat the Boston Celtics. I believe they matchup against the Celtics better than the Nets and Bucks due to their wing defenders. The Heat will can play man defense and just switch everything. #NBAPlayoffs #NBATwitter@BBALLBABE6 No one plans for 2 starters out, one on short notice, however I still think with the correct attitude and ball movement, we will still be in it!

Ime Udoka is in his first season coaching the Boston Celtics. There is enormous respect between those men, who have known one another for decades and have deep ties. Now they meet in the NBA East finals. 
https://t.co/TbiflX47aa@ledgerbets @celtics Comes down to how they decide to attack like the bucks who like to protect the paint Miamisburg priority defense is their zone and basically force u to shoot shots which the celtics bite of a lot@RVADad4theCelts @CelticsRiley @celtics Same here , I just joined last month and have 350 . @celtics fans are the best , enjoying this run and hopefully it's lasts another month.@celtics @scottzolak Nba players are softPls win @celtics@celtics Robert Williams hopefully steps up big timeI guess the @Royals have given up on playing baseball and moved on to playing basketball @celtics https://t.co/z3mQQAHXYK@celtics What they mean by health and safety protocols??@DirtyLenzMG @celtics Ya mutha. +ratio@celtics Oh no.....GREAT PLAYOFF MATCHUPS: 24yo Oscar Robertson vs 34yo Bob Cousy

Let's see how they cope without two good starters whole they get some more rest. Horford is 35 so this rest does him well and Smart needs to be close to fully healed to run around.

The Boston bench runs too deep. @NBA #NBAPlayoffs2022The @celtics  social media team sent out an Instagram story showing #AlHorford on the court with the rest of the team earlier.

Gonna catch up on Derry Girls beforehand 🍀🍀🍀The @celtics will have PF/C Robert Williams III (@rob_williamsIII) available for Game 1 and he should be able to play "significant minutes" according to @wojespn 

#Celtics #BleedGreen #NBA 
#NBAPlayoffs #NBAPlayoffs2022 
#NBATwitter #NBATwitterLive@celtics Noy worried it's okay they could still win without them. Robert to play centre and Grant to play that defence in place of smart. I prefer Smart plays fully healed instead of aggravating his injury and Al Horford gets some rest so when he returns he'd be fit. He's 35Miami Heat / Boston Celtics 🏀 NBA Eastern Conference Finals

Personally I'd want to see the Boston Celtics win this first series, but then Heats have just been solid all thru the playoffs. Jim Butler, Bam Adebayo, Herro. They've all been solid

If Rob is out, is it a 6-man rotation?@celtics @wojespn While the Horford OUT is a surprise, the #BleedGreen are being smart with Marcus Smart and his midfoot sprain. 

If he worsened this ‘mild’ injury, he would likely be done for the playoffs. 

There’s a chance he misses Game 2 as well. 

These are also called Lisfranc injuries.@celtics NBA is rigged@celtics What the?@camclark25 @JimmysBurner5 @celtics Our 3rd best player is out@celtics @wojespn From a heat fan: GOD FUCKING DAMNIT!@space_diff @celtics I was going to bet Boston to win the series but was going to wait until they lost game 1.

The current Boston Celtics roster has evolved from the 2018 team we know. Jason Tatum and Jaylen Brown were rookies now they’re allstars the current DPOY is there too. And even with that inexperienced 2018 team the Cavaliers went to  a game 7If Robert Williams plays in every game the rest of the way, I will get a Celtics tattoo. 

Don’t bother sending parlor recs.

#nochanceinhell @celtics@clxete @bigmeatmayfield @celtics He can guard him for times during the series, the Heat would be wise to keep Bam underneath or RobbWilliams will be catching a lot of lobs from Smart.

JB/Pritchard on Lowry   2. Tatum/White on Strus.  3. G. Williams/Horford on Butler. 4. Horford/Theis on PJ Tucker  5. RW3/Horford on Bam.  The matchup problem is Butler. I would avoid Tatum guarding him. This gives us winning size advantages.The Miami Heat are the WORST team that the Celtics have had to face so far in the playoffs. Celtics in 6

#NBATwitter #HEATCulture #BleedGreen #NBAFinals https://t.co/m4pbOPge8BI got @celtics in 6 and I’m talkin bout the FinalsThinking Victor Oladipo could be our X factor vs Boston. Celtics do alot of switching. It'll slow down whatever action we run in the half court. But when you get a switch, one way to beat it is to get past your matchup &amp; force help, which throws off the switch. So (1/2)@celtics in 6, beat the @MiamiHEAT #Playoffs #NBA #EasternConferenceFinals@Ddelliponti08 @SportsCenter @MiamiHEAT @celtics Both of these teams have been the two BEST teams in the East all year. 
All year.

Let’s go Celtics!Tuesday Trivia!!

What team won the very first NBA game?

A. Boston Celtics
B. Philadelphia Warriors
C. New York Knicks
D. Toronto Huskies

Check back tomorrow for the answer!With four teams remaining in the conference championship round, my #NBAPlayoffs predictions for each Conference Finals series:

- Boston Celtics over Miami Heat in 7.
- Golden State Warriors over Dallas Mavericks in 6.I did this yesterday. Got the date wrong. On THIS date in 1987, the Boston Celtics defeated the Milwaukee Bucks 119-113 in the NBA Eastern Conference Semifinals in a real rock fight for a 4-3 series win. Hooray Celtics!

 https://t.co/kqUVEe87dG@Celtics_PRam @celtics I always thought it was weird that Boston gets the racist label but teams in cities down south like new orleans, atlanta, texas teams… etc… are not considered as bad in NBA discussions.

The Boston Celtics owe the Miami Heat one or two.
The last time around in ECF play, Boston had no answer for Bam Adebayo.
This time around our C’s have Al Horford and Robert Williams.
I’m cautiously optimistic.

0 - 25% - Miami Heat
25 - 50% - Boston Celtics
50 - 75% - Dallas Mavericks
75 - 100% - Golden State Warriors https://t.co/ZdJ0ARC61i@tachyonspeed55 @celtics @paytonpritch3 Yup last series it was Grant and now it’s gonna be Pritchard because Vincent/Strus will not be able to guard him.Gotta factor in the NBA rig tho RT @SLAMnewswire: Spoelstra and the Miami Heat anticipate a "throwback series" against the Boston Celtics.

"If both teams are really on top of their games, this should be a series where neither team is scoring 130 points."
