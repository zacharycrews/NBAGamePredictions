They need to turn it up a notch.Nasir Little just missed being a huge bust. One point, he was a projected 2nd overall pick. Fell to the @trailblazers at 25th pick of the 2019 NBA Draft. He was being compared to Kawhi Leonard.@trailblazers Why doesn’t @NBAonTNT track team fouls in a quarter  a team gets into the penalty? Aren’t team fouls just as - or even more - important than the remaining timeouts?@trailblazers Another home court win , please from Calgary 🇨🇦@trailblazers Portland why does god hate us?@Corey_D2021 @trailblazers @brookeolzendam @KevinCalabro @L_Hurd @travisdemers @mdhhoops Me too!

TNT isn’t a Fubotv channel??😫@saraakm7 @trailblazers Just TNTThe Nuggets trail 13-12 early. Aaron Gordon scored Denver's first five points; Jeff Green with the next seven. Portland with 8 of its points in  Denver's paint, and the Nuggets have three turnovers that have produced four of the Blazers' points.@trailblazers Sucks that DAME has to play with these clowns. Nurkic is probably the worst bigman in the league. Can't do anything and also so slow.@lilllardinho @trailblazers You’re not a blazer fanLmmfao I just heard the organ player, at the @trailblazers arena, playing my shit!!!! #Igot5onit
