After every 3 pt shot#AtlantaHawks the defense is just awful. Can‚Äôt get stops, no one is crashing the glass smh. Maybe we should try denying DeRozan the ball. Because whoever is guarding is giving up penetration to damn easy. One dribble and DeRozan is free ü§¶üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èAtlanta hawks announcer gotta shut tf up GBlake Bear #251 Sold.

NBA - Atlanta Hawks 53 complete season in ATL, no titles, 1 conference final app, and that was last year. Or the Buffalo Braves-SD Clippers-LA Clippers, 30 seasons of bad bball, last 10 have been better.#10 Atlanta hawks have the home court advantage today against the #2 Chicago bulls. This is going to be a tuff match up for the bulls because both of there best defenders are out due to injuries. But I have faith my Chicago Bulls will get the win. #onusm2022 https://t.co/TH54ChL0GuLet's see if the Atlanta Hawks are here to play basketball tonight, scout the other team or be cheerleaders.üèÄ De‚ÄôANDRE HUNTER üèÄ
