ü§£@dallasmavs @RealJasonKidd @RealJasonKidd when Luka is active, it's all Luka iso, not a way to run an offense. Luka can drive &amp; kick but PnR isn't his strong suit.

Kid isn't gonna reach his potential if y'all hold him back.@dallasmavs @RealJasonKidd not like you ever read these but what kind of play calling was that down the stretch?
