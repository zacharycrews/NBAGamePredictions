8 on the @dallasmavs and 8 on the @WashWizards. 

🤣@dallasmavs @RealJasonKidd @RealJasonKidd when Luka is active, it's all Luka iso, not a way to run an offense. Luka can drive &amp; kick but PnR isn't his strong suit. I'd start Frank with Luka and have Frank relieve Luka of some playmaking duties. Kid isn't gonna reach his potential if y'all hold him back.@dallasmavs @RealJasonKidd not like you ever read these but what kind of play calling was that down the stretch? KP &amp; Brunson iso after iso. Frank is the best PnR playmaker on the team even better than Luka and y'all aren't utilizing that. Check Frank n KP PnR #s in NY.@dallasmavs let’s talk business https://t.co/OdzzP47jqz@mcuban why did the @dallasmavs lie and say the Dirk Jersey retirement game was sold out when it actually wasn’t?

Portland had Mychal Thompson, a young Clyde Drexler, and Kiki Vandeweghe. Dallas had a chance to prove Kiki wrong. Instead they lost the series 1-3. https://t.co/VgOjaq4uSpThe Dallas Mavericks were awarded the 1st pick in the 1981 NBA Draft. With the first pick they selected Mark Aguirre, a small forward from DePaul. One of the picks the Mavs traded Vandeweghe for turned into the 9th pick, which the Mavs used to select the Rolando Blackman. https://t.co/Ni3Rbsl5NvAfter receiving over 4,600 postcards, the team was named ‘The Dallas Mavericks.’ The team hired Dick Motta as head coach, and then drafted Kiki VanDeWeghe of UCLA with the 11th pick in 1980.
