He's had rough stretches this season, but with Houston headed for the lottery, there's no reason why he shouldn't get more burn to end his rookie campaign.Ty Lue pregame vs. Houston:

-  After playing 60 games already, he's wary of young Rockets' speed
- Impressed at Jalen Green's shot selection, feels like he usually makes good play
- RoCo's off-the-dribble creation has surprised him, pleasantly. RoCo "making right pass"The Houston Rockets Gerald Green had 3 blind dates in the locker room at halftime.#NBA,

@HoustonRockets | #Rockets https://t.co/3KPdTDRRGy@fymroo Look at the Suns, they've pretty much secured the #1 seed and Devin Booker played over 40 minutes last night to come back against *Houston Rockets* and we're supposed to just settle for being better than last season. Hell nah#HoustonRockets despiden a #EnesFreedom; Reacciones en Twitter tras despido | NTD https://t.co/mAVbYTYqiN@UZzy_Jay @DavidMorant48 @HoustonRockets Indeed. I was hoping that the Rockets would try to re-acquire KO at some point. He fit perfectly.@btpsvk @HoustonRockets Haha. No. Although Sengun could be a good starter, Sengun is more impactful as a backup: running the 2nd unit with less disruption due to his playmaking, rebounding, and post scoring.@Yok11064803 @HoustonRockets I can see Green playing 1-3 due to his height, athleticism, and ball-handling. While Sengun could make a good starter, Sengun brings post playmaking, rebounding, and post scoring as a backup. He can run the 2nd unit without much interference.NBA Game Analysis - The LA Clippers have a forecast 73% chance to win against The Houston Rockets with a spread of -7.5/7.5 and an over/under of 222. The LA Clippers are 0 - 0 against The Houston Rockets in the 2021-22 Season.

There is no need to fire Silas because of defensive woes. Silas cannot play elite defense (or make shots or make passes) for the guys. The game plan is fine. The Rockets have stretches in games where the defense is good. The players’ execution needs more consistency.Hey…at least it’s not January and the Houston Rockets are celebrating on our home court.@rxmje Damn Houston beat the Rockets again 😕@HoustonRockets It would have been wild to pull off the win tonight, but I was impressed with what I saw, against the best team in the NBA. 🚀🚀🚀Nasa's Johnson Space Center, Houston

https://t.co/t8dh9OlMrU@DavidMorant48 @HoustonRockets Yes, I hope Dennis Schröder is signed to a 2-3 year deal. Some fans forget that, before his meltdown in play with the 2020-2021 Lakers, he was a 2020 6th Man of the Year candidate with the Thunder, along with a good 2020 playoffs performance. Schröder is a true point guard.#PhoenixSuns - #HoustonRockets 124:121

The young guys are building chemistry and being eased into situations by Coach Silas and company. The young guys are also being guided by the NBA veterans by watching their on-court performance.

https://t.co/GcqXjCzV24@DavidMorant48 @MikellMoon @HoustonRockets I’m saying. I’d rather have Kevin Mchale back then have Silas coach@DavidMorant48 @HoustonRockets Let’s not exaggerate with “letting” and “50% every game”. The Rockets’ defensive problem is its interior defense. Garuba will help when he recovers from injury. Plus, the Rockets will need to find a replacement for Theis (Bruno Fernando?) while Sengun continues to improve.##NBAVideos: Dennis Schroder FIRST Rockets Buckets 🙌

However, it was a great showing overall. Keep playing like that.THAT’S GAME! @Suns finish on top, finishing with a final score of 124-121 over the @HoustonRockets https://t.co/jxkp0l2qsd@HoustonRockets arrest EG for war crimes@HoustonRockets Without kpj and wood, team is better.Think about that..@HoustonRockets Credit to you lot put up a good fight, gg@HoustonRockets EG sold, then unsold, then sold again. Smh@HoustonRockets we lost but i’m excited for the future… ride or die for the rockets@HoustonRockets FUCK THIS SHIT MAN@HoustonRockets Sit Wood for the rest of the season. That game was actually fun@HoustonRockets Another reason sengun is the best rookie on the rockets@HoustonRockets I’m so proud of y’all either way.@HoustonRockets Glad we can watch these washed vets Brick 3s instead of giving any minutes to Josh or NixSuns beat the Rockets 124-121.

Houston gave the Suns everything they had. Gordon came on late, but some clutch plays from Bridges and Johnson helped PHX hold on minus Chris Paul. Comeback complete. 

Booker: 24/8/3
Ayton: 23 PTS, 9 REBS
Bridges: 17 PTS, 7 REBS
Johnson: 14/4/5@HoustonRockets You really want to beat Phoenix Hun?@HoustonRockets Silas is a shit coach! We're tanking and he has EG taking 20+ shots while Jalen takes 12 😂😂😂 dude is a shitty coach@HoustonRockets it was a good look i thought it was going in@HoustonRockets Good show tonight,but if y’all played like this every game, not just against the Suns, y’all would have a better record🤷🏻‍♂️ It’s a mindset!😂@Suns celebrate their win against @HoustonRockets with a final score of 124-121 !! #GoSuns 🧡💜 https://t.co/k0iCNJCp5iGreat game and effort @HoustonRockets ....I can deal with this L
..VAI TOMAR NO CU HOUSTON ROCKETSThat was a good game @HoustonRocketsI think WITHOUT CP3 the Suns won’t it to the Finals this year. I’m watching the tail end of the Rockets v Suns game tonight and they’re struggling, barely beating Houston.A young Houston squad took the best team in the league down to the wire on the road. All the bright spots and signs of development on display in this game don't go away because the Rockets lost. Impressive showing.The @Suns are supposedly the best team in the NBA how are they barely beating the sorry a** @HoustonRockets  #HOUvsPHX@NBA @HoustonRockets @Suns The difference is not that clear@RatiodbyJamal @NBA @HoustonRockets @Suns cp3 got ejected💀@HoustonRockets Such a tough finish@RatiodbyJamal @NBA @HoustonRockets @Suns 5.5 games behind bro 😂😂@HoustonRockets Shoulda traded gordon when his value were highReady for bro to give me the word so I can get these @HoustonRockets tickets@HoustonRockets THE TURNOVERS ARE KILLING ME@HoustonRockets Tate 😐@HoustonRockets Y’all were up 3 with 1:30 to go🚨 Bridges puts PHX up 4 🚨

He has 23-6-7-1-1 on 50% shooting. He's been a huge part in Houston giving Phoenix a tough time pulling away- and even was helping hold a quick double digit lead in the 3rd quarter #Rockets@HoustonRockets Nice another highlight why Silas sells with dog shit rotations@HoustonRockets EG sucks@HoustonRockets gj Silas sit hot hands Sengun and play scrubs to lose the game at the 4th.Tanking ?@HoustonRockets EG driving to the hoop never gets old@HoustonRockets Eg sucksRockets would be insanely good if healthy and without #35 on the roster. Just saying. #rockets #rockets #houston@HoustonRockets Silas is a trash ass coach the fuck are these rotations@QC00KWRLD @HoustonRockets SCRATIOWATCH: Phoenix Suns’ Chris Paul ejected for making contact with official https://t.co/IMpcatzGLS #NBA #HoustonRockets #PhoenixSuns@HoustonRockets There's a link between minutes = production 🤔@HoustonRockets EG to the YMCA for a one day trial and a used towel? who says no?@HoustonRockets @kroger 20-6 run now ... on the verge of getting blown out as usual

This team is too stupid to win.

Fire Silas@HoustonRockets 12-0 rub by Suns. Stop it and play some D!!@adommin_84 @NBAOfficial @Suns @HoustonRockets Might be the worst I’ve ever seen.@HoustonRockets  Was fun while it lasted tonight,  saw some improvement,  a different team, looked better. #SorryCWood@HoustonRockets put eric gordon on the fucking BENCH!!!Dennis Schroder made his first start as a Rocket in his second game for Houston and has 18 points, 7 assists and 5 rebounds heading into the fourth; it is his 7th time recording at least 15 points, 5 assists and 5 boards this season; he has scored 20+ points 16 times this season.@tiddiemack @danxloki An YALL better than Houston Rockets SMFHLet’s go @HoustonRockets@HoustonRockets Give him more minutes. He might surprise us more.@HoustonRockets @kroger Rockets being the 4th quarter clanging a bunch of 3's ...

Getting lazy and just jacking 3's is a great way to lose this game.@HoustonRockets how much did you guys pay the refs tonight?@himanshushines @HoustonRockets He’s gone by next season.End of Q3 in Phoenix!

The @HoustonRockets lead by 6!

What can we expect from the @Suns in the final frame?

#NBA75 #NBATwitterLIVE@HoustonRockets @kroger After actually playing a good, competitive 3 quarters ...

This game is now trending towards an L ... as after playing good defense for a while ... we've not got Phoenix up to 48.5% shooting.

If they get over 50%, this'll be another L.

No defense = LosingHey @NBAOfficial this @Suns game against the @HoustonRockets is borderline unwatchable. These refs should be suspended from games for a month. #ValleyProudDennis Schröder came to play. Houston Rockets hanging tough against Phoenix and leading after three quarters.Interesting 3rdQ for #Rockets Dennis Schroder. Had 12 pts, but also 5 turnovers. Rockets turnovers by quarter: 1st: 1, 2nd: 4, 3rd: 9. Houston leads Phoenix 95-89 heading to 4thQ.@HoustonRockets @kroger Give him more shots 👍@HoustonRockets @kroger Start Sengun bench Wood@HoustonRockets @kroger What happened with Christ Paul?After three-quarters Houston leads Phoenix 95-89. #Rockets #LightTheFuse #Sarge@JacobMc977 @HoustonRockets losing &gt; winning . TANKNo KPJ, no C-Wood…and the @HoustonRockets are fighting. Shows the power of having a true PG running the offense with Schroeder. Lotta game left but impressive performance so far #HOUvsPHX@HoustonRockets @kroger Holy shit@HoustonRockets PLEASE@carlossgotit @HoustonRockets We winning be happyKenyon Martin JR! BEHAVE!!!!!! @ATTSportsNetSW @HoustonRocketsI love what I see with Dennis Schroder! 
I would love to see #Rockets start with Dennis+ KPJ + Green+ Sengun + Tate and then good bench minutes for Josh + KJM + Matthews + Garuba + EG + Nwaba

Needless to say I don’t want C Wood on floor anymore 🤣.Get him out of @HoustonRockets@HoustonRockets bro let jalen take more shotsI realized this was going to be a trap game yesterday when the Houston Rockets were practicing at ASU before the Suns Clippers gameWorld infamous 3rd quarter Houston RocketsCall me crazy but I think Houston is way better without KPJ and Wood. Mainly Wood is the problem as he disrupts the flow of the Rockets offense as he takes his 100000 questionable shotsPhoenix Suns player #23 Cameron Johnson scores a 3-pointer in the third-quarter bringing the score to 82-79, @HoustonRockets leading.@HoustonRockets He working Ayton@DK53438259 @DevinsBookie The one that got away- Just remember that when you decide to ride the Houston Rockets to beat the Pheonix Suns at Home https://t.co/ndkzoYwB8pThis @HoustonRockets team I am watching is the one I want to see. Dennis Schroder is gonna be great for this young team if this is what he brings every night he gets to play.@misterpresence3 @HoustonRockets nvm someone had the same pfp as you mb@misterpresence3 @HoustonRockets weren’t you the guy that replied to me earlier@misterpresence3 @HoustonRockets guess i was wrong 💀@HoustonRockets who said he couldn’t shoot@HoustonRockets SENGUN caught fire 🔥🔥🔥@HoustonRockets  Have yourself a night Sengun!!@ATTSportsNetSW @HoustonRockets v.c. vs. tmac vs. stevie franchise slam dunk contestSuns broadcast having a commercial for a law firm called “Sweet James” while playing against the Houston #Rockets feels… odd.@HoustonRockets 🤮 hops@HoustonRockets He makes so stupid fouls in every game 🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️@HoustonRockets Good lawd have mercy@HoustonRockets We should keep him@HoustonRockets This guy right here? https://t.co/v9WPKvd66n@HoustonRockets Dont switch on post!!!Phoenix Suns - Houston Rockets
