He's had rough stretches this season, but with Houston headed for the lottery, there's no reason why he shouldn't get more burn to end his rookie campaign.Ty Lue pregame vs. Houston:

-  After playing 60 games already, he's wary of young Rockets' speed
- Impressed at Jalen Green's shot selection, feels like he usually makes good play
- RoCo's off-the-dribble creation has surprised him, pleasantly. RoCo "making right pass"The Houston Rockets Gerald Green had 3 blind dates in the locker room at halftime.#NBA,

@HoustonRockets | #Rockets https://t.co/3KPdTDRRGy@fymroo Look at the Suns, they've pretty much secured the #1 seed and Devin Booker played over 40 minutes last night to come back against *Houston Rockets* and we're supposed to just settle for being better than last season. Hell nah#HoustonRockets despiden a #EnesFreedom; Reacciones en Twitter tras despido | NTD https://t.co/mAVbYTYqiN@UZzy_Jay @DavidMorant48 @HoustonRockets Indeed. I was hoping that the Rockets would try to re-acquire KO at some point. He fit perfectly.@btpsvk @HoustonRockets Haha. No. Although Sengun could be a good starter, Sengun is more impactful as a backup: running the 2nd unit with less disruption due to his playmaking, rebounding, and post scoring.@Yok11064803 @HoustonRockets I can see Green playing 1-3 due to his height, athleticism, and ball-handling. While Sengun could make a good starter, Sengun brings post playmaking, rebounding, and post scoring as a backup. He can run the 2nd unit without much interference.NBA Game Analysis - The LA Clippers have a forecast 73% chance to win against The Houston Rockets with a spread of -7.5/7.5 and an over/under of 222. The LA Clippers are 0 - 0 against The Houston Rockets in the 2021-22 Season.

It would have been nice after a hard day. But they played well and held their own.Great game @HoustonRockets but after the All Star break we can let em all go.

Y‚Äôall know it would have been a blow out with CP3. https://t.co/f3MzQkLtNN@HoustonRockets The future of this team is Sengun. the solution is very simple; get sengun in the first five, trade wood at the end of the season https://t.co/mRXOFWsDWlThe #Rockets just went toe-to-toe with the best team in the NBA.

Amazing performances from all the Houston starters, including the best game of Alperen Sengun's career.

Tough loss, but great night.

The @HoustonRockets lead by 6!

What can we expect from the @Suns in the final frame?

#NBA75 #NBATwitterLIVE@HoustonRockets @kroger After actually playing a good, competitive 3 quarters ...

This game is now trending towards an L ... as after playing good defense for a while ... we've not got Phoenix up to 48.5% shooting.

If they get over 50%, this'll be another L.

No defense = LosingHey @NBAOfficial this @Suns game against the @HoustonRockets is borderline unwatchable.
