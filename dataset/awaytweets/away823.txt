=&gt; https://t.co/L3jfR4ezYN https://t.co/OdTOefjaG5@AxisW_ @Garydwayne @warriors Dont careWhen the golden state warriors stay padded for 2️⃣ whole seasons when they had Kevin Durant no 1️⃣ criticized or had anything to say but the stars have to get their playing time…
❗️ could tell this isn’t going to work out Russ does too much that clashes with other players style https://t.co/Stw5VQcfAt#HearMeOut
One thing that doesn’t get discussed enough is how crazy it was that Mike D’Antoni benched Kenneth Faried during that Golden State Warriors playoff series. How do you put one of your most athletic players on the sideline…
#SargeIf @StephenCurry30 and the @warriors looked as bad as the @Lakers do this year…. Y’all would be killing him on twitter this year. https://t.co/oTy6Gl5qJ9@strait_trippin @Warriorsnin3rs @jr_heeen @Yay_Arreeeaaaaa @warriors @SteveKerr .... because almost everybody on that 19-20 roster, outside of Green and Looney, had no experience whatsoever with Kerr's system? And most of them are rookies and g league dudes?

#BamBam @BamBam1A @BAMBAMxABYSSThe same (presumably black) guy who runs @JackBox twitter, needs to run the @warriors one lolDame &amp; CJ was like poor man version to Golden State Splash Brothers Curry &amp; Klay.

They did their thing. Had a good era. Maybe squeeze in a chip in another era but just couldn’t beat Warriors.

* Klay Thompson is 46% (18-39) from 3 over the last 5 games.

* Steph Curry over the last 4 games is shooting 48.8% from deep (20-41)@warriors @BamBam1A wow wow so happy

@BamBam1A@JakeArt20068285 @Forty2wice @Jumpshot8 @NBA @warriors @GSWOutsiders Last tweet before I flush the toilet. Pop quiz. How many NBA titles have the Suns won? Not waiting. ZERO! NONE! ZILCH! You ignorance of geography is astounding, can't build on water. Great sports teams, Silicon Valley, beautiful beaches, Redwoods. California! Phoenix? Horrible!As bad as the Lakers are being whooped by the Bucks, Lakers fan can take comfort that this game is a lot closer than the Bucks - Warriors game. The Bucks had Golden State down 77 - 38 at the half.

Kerr allowed them to shoot 13-15 3s each every game which it was unheard off back then, made plays for them to be able to shoot 4m the arc. Teams used to average 10-13 3s per game, not per playerCircle 1

I can only smile at the foolishness of hyping a record before the All-Star break. Such a small town mentality, desperate for attention and how sad that they NEVER have won it all. @warriors @GSWOutsiders@warriors My dad will fight anyone who disparages Don Nelson.  I’m pretty sure they shared beers at a seedy bar in San Lorenzo a few times.@14VONDALE @warriors Here he goes again off his meds and shi🤦‍♂️ https://t.co/Dgo7cpqarK@RaeReasch @BigTicket_JW @warriors Welcome back and glad to hope you are much better.Bring Boogie back to the bay @warriors  ‼️@missionarymelo @warriors @SteveKerr which one of these coaches had 0 great players??@warriors @KlayThompson this is beautiful ❤️What could’ve been @warriors https://t.co/XZAvNoeKKr@titanmatt_ As long as ego’s don’t get in the way they’ll stay together for a while…there’s a real Golden State Warriors vibe with this team@AkibaXv @GSWRevengeTour @warriors Its was by choiceHappy birthday to favorite shooter in NBA history!

Jersey Swap with @TitoThatGuy 

I think we might have started an Annual Christmas Jersey Swap 😅

But these gotta be one of the cleanest jerseys in the league 🥵🔥🏀
@warriors @MiamiHEAT 

*stay tuned for this years swap* 👀 https://t.co/P20VbpX67i@mdburner2 @Warriorsnin3rs @warriors @SteveKerr D’Antoni was head coach of the Lakers in 2013-14 so wasn’t available.  He also has no championships despite having had very good teams in Houston. They implemented his system which was entirely Harden dependent and led to 27 missed threes.@warriors @juanonjuan10 @juanonjuan10 I hope u got some tricks and dunks that might get u the DUB.@RoseclimbpaintC Oh the Golden State Warriors building! Enjoy the show!@warriors @SteveKerr Congrats. 👏🐐
@SteveKerr but why did u name ur son Nick?@juanonjuan10 all day! @warriors in there like swimwear baby! https://t.co/r4rb21qKyK@BaselineBoos We would much rather play the frauds in golden state lmao. Lebron owns the warriors to begin with plus we match up way better with them than Phoenix
