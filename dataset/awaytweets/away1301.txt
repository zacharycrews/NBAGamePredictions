@nbastreamsclub https://t.co/Vgn1Y7CJcK@TTV_ETERNXTY @celtics Yes but Giannis is the only problem we lost the last game because of rebounds, not boxing out and protecting the paint. The best person for that job is Timelord. Sad we played a whole series without him.Please don’t disappoint me tonight @celtics@GogglesReviews @GhettoJrue @celtics Lose*Score my points than the bucks @celticsLet’s Go!!! @celtics ☘️☘️@celtics Turns out it is unrelated to the surgery.

And thank goodness for Dads (and, of course moms)The @celtics path to the finals is definitely the hardest I can think of in recent memory.

If @celtics don't beat the @Bucks they didn't want to badly enough. And I question their drive. Their heart. All past greats had both heart and drive down deep. Show some excitement. Act like you want to win. 5 players on the floor. Bucks essentially have 1.@celtics @WILLIAMSS_OG they’re coming😤Good morning to @celtics fans@celtics Go get em@Dom_2k I am a firm believer that The Boston Celtics won that Championship in spite of him being their head coach.🟢 BUCKS GAME DAY🟢

There was a catch, though; his new deal was only partially guaranteed, which left him vulnerable.@SydneyFCman @RoyalAShepherd @celtics @chicagobulls Shortly thereafter, his NBA dreams were realized when Boston signed him to a two-way contract. Once training camp rolled around, however, Strus’ situation changed in a hurry.@SydneyFCman @RoyalAShepherd @celtics @chicagobulls After he went undrafted out of DePaul in 2019, the Celtics got the first crack at Strus when they signed him for Summer League. He did well with the opportunity, too, putting up 9.8 points per contest and logging shooting splits of 41-45-86 over four games in Las Vegas.The @TBLightning have now won 17 straight playoff games following a loss within that same postseason.

He was just carried by Tom Thibodeoux and the Big 3 in Boston Celtics.
while in Clippers he could never win it all, now in 76ers with stars around still couldn't beat Miami.Thank you Von Wafer for your time and efforts with the Boston Celtics!@BleacherReport Don’t do this @celtics@FrogmansWorld @UnashAcari @StoolGreenie @celtics And that one road loss could have easily been a win too@DevinBook &amp;&amp; @luka7doncic is the new @kobebryant  &amp; @paulpierce34 ☘️🏀 I SAY THAT AS AN @NBA @NBAonTNT @TheGameDayNBA @ESPNNBA BUT ALSO @NBAAllStar #LEGENDS I SAY THAT AS A @celtics fan💚@Senator_AA @WorldWideWob @celtics @BCCoachStevens @FCHWPO Not true at all!

You're the only bloke who can take a feel good story about the Miami Heat and turn it into a Boston Celtics hate piece 🤷🏼‍♂️🤦🏼‍♂️@TerrierMBB @celtics @javantemccoy13 @ATLHawks Let’s go J!!@Ace6one7 @celtics Renner thus well!And the fact that it was the Boston Celtics just makes it all the more painful. https://t.co/wbccVAoh2FDear @celtics I believe in y’all@Dom_2k stop jinxing the 2022 champs Boston CelticsThe people rooting the hardest for the @celtics &amp; @NHLBruins this weekend will be the @RedSox…no way they wanna be the only team of the major 4 sports playing with the spotlight on their terrible team.

We never signed him. How can we let someone we've never signed, walk?@cxlturesvz @celtics @jaytatum0 @FCHWPO @Al_Horford @PutnamToday goats@bosslife_kreek @celtics Of course@SydneyFCman @RoyalAShepherd @celtics @chicagobulls Since facts matter…

How did you offer a rookie a vet minimum. 😂😂

NBA players must have signed at least one previous NBA contract to be eligible for a the Vet minimum. https://t.co/2c1Amg5FN1@celtics No hero ball tomorrow. Please play as a team and keep the ball moving and get to those loose balls. Offensive rebounds defensive rebounds ect. #DONTLETUP‼️@StoolGreenie @celtics Cmon that’s exactly right let’s go Celtics ☘️@SydneyFCman @RoyalAShepherd @celtics @chicagobulls So you had him. Signed other players and let him walk.  Thanks for clarifying.@StoolGreenie @celtics It's a L tomorrow, this should be a one way trip to Milwaukee and probably Cancun.@celtics The C’s had a 92% chance of winning the game up by six points with two minutes left in the game.  There were 232 straight playoff wins when other teams found themselves in the same situation.

Until last night . . .@FrogmansWorld @UnashAcari @StoolGreenie @celtics And a reminder, their one road loss was by 2 points in a game where Embiid goaltended and when Al Horford made a layup just milliseconds after the buzzer went off 🙄@AdamMKaufman It’s game over … Sadly The Celtics are doomed .. It is not worthy to watch the game. I really feel embarrassed as @celtics fan. I don’t trust @jaytatum0 anymore.He has just informed me he intends to be insufferable for the remainder of the Playoffs, especially if the @Celtics lose tomorrow.

On a completely unrelated side note - does anyone have the number of a good divorce attorney? https://t.co/cuPJbvtZ9b@MiamiHEAT Jimmy Butler is clearly the NBA MVP. Name a player you’d rather start an NBA team with. He’s always been my favorite, motivates, and doesn’t tolerate people who don’t commit 100%. Also, I’m a @celtics fan but would take him over any C’s player.@UnashAcari @StoolGreenie @celtics And most of the time they’ve comeback from a tough loss@LarryBirdsMull1 @Becoming_Bryna @celtics Love, love, love this photo!!!

Williams talented but if he can't stay healthy and keeps getting hurt at this young age its going to be same situation with lakers dealing with ADI can’t believe the 76ers gave us like this. YALL BETTER FIGHT LIKE HELL @celtics!!!!!!!"If Bobby Portis has another big rebounding effort in Game 6, the Bucks will win this series in six games.

He just has soreness because of the recent surgery, which could’ve been avoided if they didn’t rush him back to play when we were already up 2-0 on the Nets and didn’t need him.@riduarthur @celtics I genuinely have no idea how they’ll respond.

Any “fan” or media member who would shift blame his way doesn’t understand this team or the way competition should be approached in general. He’s the reason the @celtics flipped the switch New Year’s Eve. #Game7See what the bruins are doing? You should do that tomorrow @celtics@jordsrsly Boston Celtics. It’s actually not close either.Being behind on my DVR due to the @celtics and @NHLBruins schedule is such Boston sports fan first world problemI know the @celtics loss was tough yesterday, I’ll accept that. 
But
The @sixers?
They suck!
@JoelEmbiid needs to get out of there and go to an organization that will give him a better chance. 
Yep tough critic, but will catch a lot of shit. I’ve said what I said.After watching the Celtics choke yesterday,  this sixer game is making me feel a lot better!! @celtics #MIAvsPHI@celtics Damn that Giannis guy shot bricks all game and made a three when it mattered most, damnnitI'm good now. I like you again @celtics.@sixers obviously don't wanna see a game 7. They are ready for the off season.  Winner of @Bucks @celtics  will be headed to finals. @MiamiHEAT can't handle neither one of those teams.@celtics GET IT TOGETHER ROBERT !!!@BillSimmons is right, whoever comes out of the @celtics v @Bucks series is going to the finals. This level defence in the Miami v Philly series, especially from 76ers, is average as.“H  O  R  F  OOORDDD  THE F O L L OOOW”
