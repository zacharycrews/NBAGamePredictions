Yes, Phoenix is on a B2B but I'm riding with who I think is the clearly better team in this spot.

This is a good matchup for the Suns (they went 3-0 last season) and I really don't like the direction this Blazer team is heading. Give me Phoenix getting points.The Los Angeles Lakers are the most lazy mfs in the league. The game against the Phoenix suns was horrendous to watch and AD needs to get his act right. Actually the whole team needs to pull it together. ‚ÄúSuperstar players‚Äù more like super lazy players.DasHaus made a bet!
