#NBA #vegas #deeplearning #cryptoSo hyped to add this @Giannis_An34 signed game-used basketball from the @Bucks vs @utahjazz game on February 12,2021 in my collection. The Utah Jazz finished the 2020-21 season with best record in NBA, No. 1 seed in Western Conference while Giannis and the Bucks won the chip. https://t.co/rKJatupXQBOTD in 2020, the Oklahoma City Thunder game against the Utah Jazz was cancelled. The next day in a press conference at the Capitol @GovStitt and @joy4ok stood side by side and told schools to be ready for closures after Spring Break. And #oklaed hasn't been the same since. https://t.co/TL3c5xOkVZI am super excited to finally be able to cheer on the @utahjazz in person tonight for the first time in 10+ years. Especially to finally see @spidadmitchell play. I wish i was a little closer but I'll be the loudest Jazz fan in the arena from section 118.When work takes you courtside‚Ä¶ best part?

That gives a typical four door sedan 6 doors. 

Now wheels. You have 4 on the ground, but open the hood and there's 6-8 more wheels for your belt(s) alone! 

Even a car has more wheels than doors.@AntiRacistJazz @utahjazz @socios More hot wheels cars in my house than cabinets, doorways, whatever. Then throw in every rolling everything in the house on top of that? Wheels all day long.@utahjazz @socios Vehicle wheels (which are a huge part of the wheel count) get negated by the vehicle doors.

Most cars have 4 wheels and 4 doors. Houses have doors and exist where vehicles don‚Äôt. Doors. And Jim Morrison said so.@conradburry @utahjazz @PhilHecken @JazzUniTracker @andyblarsen @saltcityhoops @Tjonesonthenba @E_Woodyard @nbaunitracker I‚Äôve never thought of the note that way.

I didn‚Äôt take those into account. Also, I didn‚Äôt count a single cabinet door though. I was just counting tires and actual doors to and from different spaces.@utahjazz @socios People referencing things like grocery carts seem to forget how many doors are in a sky scraper... etc@buckleupjazz @utahjazz @socios Think about how many wheels are in one factory! 

Oh sorry... üòÅ@utahjazz @socios One word to explain why there are more wheels than doors and the word is: LEGO@ClintoPete @utahjazz @socios I don't want to hear your counter arguments.

It‚Äôs not about vehicles, it‚Äôs about all the small and large wheel parts that power machines across the world.@jandmplus6 @utahjazz @socios @WhitMCox Any toys with wheels? Rollerblades? Bikes? What about the wheels on the tracks for your drawers?@utahjazz @socios ps the correct answer is doors. because there are way more entrances and exits than vehicles and such.@jandmplus6 @TravLCox @utahjazz @socios @WhitMCox How many wheels are under your bed?@TankH777 @utahjazz @socios Hell naw lol@JazzFanJWH @utahjazz @socios lol nope

Nope! There's more wheels under the hood. Most of your appliances have wheels. Wheels are turning out of sight everywhere every day.Day 30 of tweeting the @utahjazz to bring ingles back@utahjazz @socios There are more songs that mention doors (194,910) than wheels (37,210) so that must mean there are more doors. 

Also doors come before wheels in the dictionary, so there‚Äôs that.@utahjazz @socios Window shutters are doors. How many doors in the average house/apartment/dwelling? Do doorways count? Are gates doors? 

I am team door.@TravLCox @utahjazz @socios @WhitMCox In my home we have 4 cars, RV, 2 trailers = 28 tires

Think about cars, they have at least as many doors as they do wheels, sometimes more@utahjazz @socios Definitely wheels because of all the toy cars, shopping carts, etc. A grocery store for example might have 2-4 doors but probably has at least 100 wheels if not more.@utahjazz @socios Lego makes way more wheels than it does doors, and I believe Lego's production is probably representative of the world at large. Also, wheels on office chairs make a huge difference. There are 100 chair wheels in the room I'm sitting in as I respond; only 5 doors, though.@conradburry @utahjazz @PhilHecken @JazzUniTracker @andyblarsen @saltcityhoops @Tjonesonthenba @E_Woodyard @nbaunitracker Like the designs, I just really hate the black and yellow.This might be @utahjazz's best work https://t.co/eblI4rXHh1@utahjazz @socios wheels for sure, think about all the cars, hot wheels and tire shops around the world@Poststockton @socios A big beautiful wheel! But all the little cars on the Roue de Paris have doors‚Ä¶@utahjazz @socios I would say doors. Vehicles have wheels and doors. Buildings have doors, not wheels. Plus the, the lost city of Atlantis didn‚Äôt have where at all, only doors.@utahjazz @socios There are more wheels because of hot wheels. So many of them in the world and the doors don't open.@utahjazz @socios It's a push.@utahjazz @socios Wheels in 7@utahjazz @socios Look what @TravLCox has started üòÜ@Laober22 @SenatorRomney @utahjazz @WhiteHouse That is exactly how the Republicans operate!ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è@utahjazz @socios Doors ‚Äî lots of doors without wheels in buildings like skyscrapers!@utahjazz @socios Yes but only 2 compared to 8 wheels üëÄ and after three weeks of use they cease to exist because they break off so we‚Äôve got a doorless semi which seems extremely dangerous. What am I teaching my kids?@utahjazz @socios I'm going to go wheels; in keeping with the French Night theme, have you ever heard of the Porte de Paris? Of course not. But have you heard of the Roue de Paris? Yes! If there were more doors, the French wouldn't have built the Roue de Paris. jeu termin√©.@utahjazz @socios I just want to win üòÇ@TankH777 @socios Those are good points@utahjazz @socios I‚Äôm gonna go with wheels. I don‚Äôt drive much these days and I miss having my own wheels. And it sounds like a good answer@jlinehan9 @socios Do the doors open on the toy trucks?@utahjazz @socios Wheels in 5@utahjazz @socios Wheels were invented first, so I‚Äôm going with that üòÇ@jertharrison @socios Rollerblades! Skateboards!@utahjazz @socios I don‚Äôt have a great reason, just trying to enter because my daughter does French dual immersion and would be over the moon for this!@utahjazz @socios I voted wheels and really have no idea but in our house our wheel to door ratio is significant because my son owns 45 garbage trucks, 27 police cars, and 10 fire trucks‚Ä¶ but all of those have doors too so I don‚Äôt know‚Ä¶ I just want to be the VIP on French night. S'il vous pla√Æt!@utahjazz @socios For sure wheels. Wheels are everywhere. An office chair has 10 wheels by itself@shakavaka @socios But what about cabinets? Microwaves? Lockers!@utahjazz @socios If we're counting all toy car wheels, then I'm going to have to go with Wheels, there are too many!!@utahjazz @socios Wheels,  wheels are used everywhere. Even on sliding doors,  drawers, and inside equipment where we can't see them. For sure,  wheels.@utahjazz @socios Wheels are on so many things. So many toys or chairs and obviously vehicles.@utahjazz @socios Toy cars without opening doors for the win@utahjazz @socios Hot wheels releases 520 million cars a year. Take that times 4.  Lego produced 500-700 million wheels a year.  It‚Äôs wheels.@utahjazz @socios IMO, Doors have been around much longer than wheels, and a lot of things with wheels also have doors which is why I voted Doors.@utahjazz @socios wheel because they'll take you somewhereüíØ@utahjazz @socios Do revolving doors count as more than 1 door?@Poststockton @superfinn23 @socios Those wheels would count@TylerIAm No team is scared of harden in the playoffs except the Utah jazzThe VIP experience includes suite tickets, early entry to watch the players warm up for the game, dinner, dessert, &amp; half-time snacks.

VOTE &amp; RESPOND! https://t.co/YH2ixEoljo@Poststockton @utahjazz @socios Oooooh didn't think of that.@utahjazz @superfinn23 @socios What about the wheels on the drawer? Do they count?@utahjazz @socios Hmmm. What about car shopping carts? 
Also if you think about it, a wheel usually has a door close by. Many doors without wheels.@saoumagrp @utahjazz @CanvasLMS @utahjazzbear @UtahChemistry @uofu_science Super ‚Äújazz-ed‚Äù for you. (Dad joke - I couldn‚Äôt help it.) Congratulations!@utahjazz @socios if the jazz bear drives obviously the wheels@superfinn23 @socios Drawers do NOT count@utahjazz @socios Shouldn‚Äôt even be a debate, 100% wheels@DawsTakesNote @socios What about toy cars? Or shopping carts?@conradburry @utahjazz @PhilHecken @JazzUniTracker @andyblarsen @saltcityhoops @Tjonesonthenba @E_Woodyard @nbaunitracker That‚Äôs sick as@utahjazz @socios Do cabinet doors count? What about closet doors? Are drawers another form of a door?üìä We're ready to enter the discourse... üìä

What are there more of in the world: WHEELS or DOORS?
