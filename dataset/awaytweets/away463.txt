They probably wouldn’t lose a game. But yeah, no thanks!!@NickCaminoWKYC @KingJames @cavs GREAT idea...bring him back, give up several young pieces, trade away future draft picks, then watch him leave AGAIN when he realizes that  they can't improve anymore.

Bron leaving caused the Cavs to trade Mo for Baron and the clippers first which turned into Kyrie. Literally was a cause and effect because him leaving was the direct reason the other 4 players surrounding him were even on the team@kuhlbreeze1980 @BAGF_E @mickmrgn @N_Penn10 @NickCaminoWKYC @KingJames @cavs Cavs had a complete rebuild 3 years ago…just now competing and in 3rd place…..so ya don’t need him to blow it up again.@BAGF_E @kuhlbreeze1980 @mickmrgn @N_Penn10 @NickCaminoWKYC @KingJames @cavs Those flowers mean way more than getting kicked in the nuts though because the first time being kicked in the nuts is literally what precipitated the first championship. Without Bron leaving we dont get Kyrie, Tristan, Dion, Wiggins and Bennett. Wigs + Ben turned into LoveJamal Crawford off the Cavs Bench who says no? @JCrossover @cavs@NickCaminoWKYC @KingJames @cavs Don’t do that.

For today we are taking this: (22/12/2021)

Game: Boston Celtics - Cleveland Cavaliers
‍
Dean Wade
Over 15.5 Points + Rebounds @ 1.70 odds

Almost all the bigs are out in this matchup, (Mobley,Allen,Okoro). We will see his minutes rack up and hopefully cover this!While everyone's attention is on the @warriors @suns and @BrooklynNets, the @cavs have been flying under the radar 

They are 10-2 since November 27th, just ahead of the @Suns (9-2) and @utahjazz (9-2) 

Are the @cavs in it for the long run? #NBA #Cavs #Cavaliers https://t.co/i1KuC04g0they @samamico who are probable starters tonight for @cavs?@NickCaminoWKYC @KingJames @cavs Jesus, Nick!

While he has been a key cog in winning 4, the roster chaos and future mortgaging that he brings with him doesn’t seem like the right move Ruth this current roster. He had his chance to rebuild w this franchise.Come back to @cavs https://t.co/12d9uvmnBDDay 44 of asking @cavs for a follow backcleveland cavaliers@BenAxelrod @cavs It's Unc.#MustDo — @celtics  vs. @cavs | 7:30 p.m. | @tdgarden | Don't miss cheering on the home team tonight.  🏀

I’m 6’1”, 38 years old and have never played above the youth level. But I can commit six fouls if you need them. And I’m cheap.The Cleveland Cavaliers are not only a threat to any team in the East, but they have TWO players who should be selected to their first All-Star game this season.

Who are these two players? Find out in my latest piece @TWSN___ 

https://t.co/kiO6S0euPX@N_Penn10 @BAGF_E @NickCaminoWKYC @KingJames @cavs I feel the same exact way. As long as he doesn’t have complete roster control so he can’t ship guys out like Okoro. I doubt Garland, JA, of Mobley would be on the way out if he came. Lebron is Lebron. Lebron means championship aspirations🏀 #NBA
