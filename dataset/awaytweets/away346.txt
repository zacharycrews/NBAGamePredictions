He‚Äôd play today for sure. But would he merely be a fundamentally sound hustle big on offense (like Kanter) mixed with Baynes defense?

Or would he become money from 3 (was solid by early 90‚Äôs) &amp; remain an elite rim defender, so a Brook Lopez type starter?@celtics Imagine if yall rested brown for the 3 games he was daytoday@celtics @trailblazers @NBCSBoston @985TheSportsHub See you there :)@Redvizsla @JohnnyH004 @taylorcsnow @jaytatum0 @celtics @Stathead Laimbeer someone I‚Äôve never decided if he‚Äôd be better or worse in the mod game.

#BleedGreen https://t.co/OaA09X6DUb@Redvizsla @JohnnyH004 @taylorcsnow @jaytatum0 @celtics @Stathead I think Tatum is a guy who would eventually adjust to put up Alex English numbers. Same with KD. He‚Äôs so skinny, but would still shoot right over most D‚Äôs.

I think someone like Harden would have a real tough time &amp; end up only being like Purvis Short or World B Free in the 80‚Äôs.@Redvizsla @JohnnyH004 @taylorcsnow @jaytatum0 @celtics @Stathead I won‚Äôt say Tatum would score 5 a game. Like most guys today he‚Äôd simply see his stats decrease across the board if time machined back to the 80‚Äôs. Would have to toughen up &amp; adjust.

Bird meanwhile would OBLITERATE the modern game if time machined from 1980 to say 2013.üòÇ@HonestLarry1 That was a great series that I was so happy about @celtics winning but Bernard King was a handful before injuries derailed the great career he was having.@Jate57 @celtics Who cares let them get an extra day off lillard not even playing.

https://t.co/ku2m1JRTbz@brandon_lirio22 @celtics When the game was on the line and there to be taken.
We let them do that.@celtics Fluke 3 pointers by Utah saved their asses. Usually I‚Äôm always pissed after a Celtics loss. But today we played amazing as a team. If we play like this when brown in on the floor. We are a crazy team. We had a slow start but I feel like we gone finish for sure top 6.@celtics mike conley and mitchell were on something else in the 4th@celtics gotta win tomorrow@celtics this can happen. So let‚Äôs go to the @trailblazers at #portland for next victory ‚úåÔ∏è on this @nba road trip.

Jazz shots the lights out yeah but they left Horford in 2 on 1s every time their ball handlers got downhill. Really hard to watch@jmpre1985 @AztroJB7 @LordBrOFFICIAL @celtics Who the fuck is Joe Ingalls. And INGLES is garb this year.@JShuttlesworthh @celtics Jazz offense is unsustainable which is why they will never be a championship team. 2nd round out again...
