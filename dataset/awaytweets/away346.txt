Right, when Larry was Tatum’s age LAST YEAR he was All-NBA 1st, brought a team w/o Parish &amp; McHale, just 1 all-star (like the Jays) to the ECF and got serious MVP consideration.

Tatum wasn’t even All-NBA 3rd.

Allen Iverson, one of the fastest players to ever play the game, said 34-38 year old Stockton was one of the toughest guys he ever had to score on.

Stockton would be one of the best defensive PG’s in the game right now.

It would be more like JB, 2 firsts, plus a young player. Successful teams aren’t just gonna give up their cornerstone, that also means the Celtics with JB.Through provocative art on his footwear, the Boston Celtics' Enes Kanter rebuked the Los Angeles Lakers' LeBron James for his self-serving attitude toward "social justice"...
https://t.co/Aa9CfZVDQS https://t.co/WraycagUIT@celtics Not good 🤦🏻‍♀️@frostybias @HonestLarry1 @celtics Wow!! I don’t even remember Red trying to sign him but I agree. He would have been great on those late 1980’s @celtics teams!! Even after his terrible injury he was scoring over 20 points a game for Bullets!!!!@JohnnyH004 @Redvizsla @taylorcsnow @jaytatum0 @celtics @Stathead Nobody’s “crying” boss. We’re only saying 80’s defense was MUCH tougher and harder to score on than today’s. This is practically irrefutable fact. Any basketball fans who don’t get this are dumb as rocks.@celtics @trailblazers @NBCSBoston @985TheSportsHub Keep grinding fellas. 💪@Redvizsla @JohnnyH004 @taylorcsnow @jaytatum0 @celtics @Stathead But Laimbeer is tricky. He’d play today for sure. But would he merely be a fundamentally sound hustle big on offense (like Kanter) mixed with Baynes defense?

Or would he become money from 3 (was solid by early 90’s) &amp; remain an elite rim defender, so a Brook Lopez type starter?@celtics Imagine if yall rested brown for the 3 games he was daytoday@celtics @trailblazers @NBCSBoston @985TheSportsHub See you there :)@Redvizsla @JohnnyH004 @taylorcsnow @jaytatum0 @celtics @Stathead Laimbeer someone I’ve never decided if he’d be better or worse in the mod game.

Obviously most 80’s stars would be better today. Since most had speed, skill &amp; good jump shots.

Then of course you have bench guys like Quinn Buckner &amp; Greg Kite who wouldn’t be in the league today.Couple more for this evening

#BleedGreen https://t.co/OaA09X6DUb@Redvizsla @JohnnyH004 @taylorcsnow @jaytatum0 @celtics @Stathead I think Tatum is a guy who would eventually adjust to put up Alex English numbers. Same with KD. He’s so skinny, but would still shoot right over most D’s.

I think someone like Harden would have a real tough time &amp; end up only being like Purvis Short or World B Free in the 80’s.@Redvizsla @JohnnyH004 @taylorcsnow @jaytatum0 @celtics @Stathead I won’t say Tatum would score 5 a game. Like most guys today he’d simply see his stats decrease across the board if time machined back to the 80’s. Would have to toughen up &amp; adjust.

Bird meanwhile would OBLITERATE the modern game if time machined from 1980 to say 2013.😂@HonestLarry1 That was a great series that I was so happy about @celtics winning but Bernard King was a handful before injuries derailed the great career he was having.@Jate57 @celtics Who cares let them get an extra day off lillard not even playing.

Top 5 debatable depending on what you value as the individual fan (peak, longevity, era, titles, records, etc.) and typically your age creates bias here too.@2_libras @water_fan1 @celtics He’s literally on one of the most team friendly deals in the league, the separation between him, Beal and Kat is not much. You’d have to throw extra assets to get a little better. Not worth it.@JohnnyH004 @Redvizsla @taylorcsnow @jaytatum0 @celtics @Stathead Wow, simply…wow.😳

Most of us love Tatum, while being smart enough to realize he’s currently flawed, has a way to go, and is nowhere near Bird, even at the same age.

But if you think Tatum’s faced tougher defenses than Larry you’re delusional and shockingly NBA illiterate.😁 https://t.co/vwHN3GE4Qr@celtics Celtics bout to let Freedom ring in Portland@trailblazers @celtics @ModaCenter @ROOTSPORTS_NW @RipCityRadio620 Tonight I'm not watching@water_fan1 @2_libras @celticsideline @celtics Don wants to play with JB.

Al Horford was quite close to a triple-double in this contest. Big Al really had to step up with Robert Williams only playing 15 minutes.
