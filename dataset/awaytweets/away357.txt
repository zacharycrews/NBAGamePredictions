I love them@cavs @utahjazz @dariusgarland22 @spidadmitchell You guys are such a fun team to watch! Keep your heads up, ya‚Äôll are the real deal. This Jazz fan will be rooting for you!! ‚Ä¶Unless you‚Äôre playing Utah, of course!I got to go to my first @cavs game of the year. What a team. Down 15 at point to one of the leagues top teams and they come up just a possession short. Never quit. Love that in a team. The core is there. If the continue to grow, this team can absolutely contend for a championship@cavs @dariusgarland22 @_bigjayy_ @fuboTV Good game@WitMiBBall @cavs WOAH! Kevin is the manUtah Jazz cools off Cleveland Cavaliers 109-108 Donovan Mitchell 35points 3rebounds 6assists.@dmansworld474 @utahjazz @cavs Damn right. In the end the jazz pulled it off but man yet again the Cavs scrapped their way back into the game and fought til the very end. Proud of our guys what a game! #LetEmKnowUtah Jazz guard Donovan Mitchell (45) drives to the basket against Cleveland Cavaliers forward Isaac Okoro (35) during the second half at Rocket Mortgage FieldHouse. 

https://t.co/Nh1lzz474O@balkansportedit @evanmobley @Juke_ @cavs @evanmobley is right there@cavs Anyone complaining about this needs to find another team to watch. We only lost by 1 to a team who made 20 threes. Any other night that's a dub, we jusy won in 3 straight road blowouts.
