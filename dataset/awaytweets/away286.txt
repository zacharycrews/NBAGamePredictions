I could go all day.

The reason is simple, he did it from last month and Hongkong, Uygur problems have existed for over ten years. I support effort for human rights BUT NOT making money by saying it.

I bet smart people will figure out his motivation soon. We'll see. Wanna know why CIA chose him? He is cheaper than anyone in his team. He stinks.🤣But be cautious when you saying this. Don't forget how salty he was every time he lost the game. You can't handle it bro.Los Angeles Lakers vs Boston Celtics who y'all got?RT @celtics: Wanna win tickets to Game 6 vs. Cleveland?
