#gamblingtwitter #NBATwitter #NBAPlayoffs #NBA75 https://t.co/eB1DvSfhaRGoing to break down today's #NBAPlayoffs games and what to watch for as each team tries to gain an early advantage early in the series. Let's start with the Utah #Jazz vs Dallas #Mavericks. Biggest factor in game one is clearly Luka's injured calf...The Dallas Mavericks and Utah Jazz will begin the 2022 NBA playoffs with their Game 1 matchup. 

For @MavericksSI, I analyzed a few keys for the Mavs: https://t.co/K9oMP3jJu6@BleacherReport Utah Jazz duo of Stockton and Malone. You can hate them but they deserved at least 1 ring.Series winner (best of 7):

1.367 - @utahjazz 
3.250 - @dallasmavs 

#NBA | https://t.co/PGWjFnrYMs https://t.co/1YCq3r4hY1What's your prediction for Game 1 of the NBA playoffs between the Utah Jazz and Dallas Mavericks?Listening to @ZachLowe_NBA talk about the @dallasmavs without @luka7doncic shows just how little he actually watched them. He literally said “idk why the @utahjazz use @rudygobert27 on Maxi or Powell, when they could hide him on @doefinney_10.” #stfuTAKE NOTE: The first round of the NBA Playoffs gets underway for the @UtahJazz and @dallasmavs at 11am.

Final: Phoenix vs Boston https://t.co/tOGYw9h3xiBoot off shows progress. 
Question is when in first series vs @utahjazz can @luka7doncic return. https://t.co/Jtfcoc34tDJanuary 19th 2022 was my last @utahjazz viewing.  Since then they've continued to portray the team who has blown past playoff leads.  
My #TakeNote brain says
 🗣"The LarryOB is up for grabs this year!"  
My #NBA realism brain says 
🗣 "The expectation is 2nd round exit."The Dallas Mavericks did a quality job of defending Utah Jazz star Donovan Mitchell in some of their recent matchups. Slowing him down will be a priority in Game 1.

For @MavericksSI, I took a look at what worked for the Mavericks when defending Mitchell: https://t.co/FYiX9pYVVi@RickyBorba @Joeingles7 @mojojojo1314 @Sam_Jagz I know how much you both love the Utah Jazz and Australia 🥰@utahjazz black and gold just means they're moving to vegasYour @dallasmavs host the @utahjazz today for the first game of the series at the @AACenter 12:00PM CST 

With or without @luka7doncic the 🔑 to the Mavs success is how well their role players can shoot today.

Does this mean the Mavs are done for?These are SOME comments by @Scalabrine about the Utah Jazz.
