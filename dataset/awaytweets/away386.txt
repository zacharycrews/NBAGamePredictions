Trae is the superstar... then it's Garland and LaMelo. Cole Anthony is having himself a year though.Check out this listing I just added to my #Poshmark closet: BB Jeans Stone Washed Shorts Authentic Sportswear Cleveland Cavaliers King James. https://t.co/jK9zo6R4A4 #shopmycloset @poshmarkapp@BIGFACTS16 @ianmirmelstein @EdGreenberger @cavs Yep.

Not just flipping shit, I'm curious how many PGs in the East are scoring over 18, assisting over 7, and shooting over 40% from 3. Just numbers that hit me as a pretty formidable combo.@nizcomix @Cavs_House @cavs @keybank Any thresholds are arbitrary but if you tell me a PG is scoring 18+, assisting 7+, and shooting 40+ from 3, I know he's at least in the all star discussion. Relative to other PGs in the East, DG's numbers slot him very high.Because I like you, I have FREE @Cavs tix this hour on my show.  Tune in at 5:25 to find out how to win @Star102CLE https://t.co/p2TL3wI33e@rodrigue700 @cavs @keybank I don't think so he isn't shown he deserves it thru the cavs rebuild he's been disappointed he was supposed to be the cavs main star but he didn't do enough but they should appreciate him for helping bring them a championship im a cavs fan and I don't think he deserves it@nizcomix @Cavs_House @cavs @keybank Can you reword that somehow? We said he's one of just 3 guys with 19/8/45% or better. His PG numbers are rare, and it's fine if you wanna say 19/8 and 40%+ from 3. They're at the top. Those are the All Stars. You're just confusing me.@cavs had a missed opportunity with the Cudi collab. woulda wished we added some trippy pinks and purples while also keeping the classic navy. kinda like the MOTM3. they couldve even incorporated the yellows and maroons in spots but idk im not a fashion designer@cavs @keybank I hate when lame casual cavs fans bash sexton for no reason I'm glad garland is playing good he's showing us the reason why the cavs drafted him none of these lame casual cavs fans on youtube are giving sexton credit all their saying is "trade him"smh4 Teamer Friday’s • +1400 Parlay 🏆

You are here blaming everyone except baker for everything.

You just said I’m an “all Baker” or “all OBJ” fault with no in between yet here you are “all Baker” You don’t care about the other players, QB only. (Hunt ran into OL and didn’t get out clean causing him late to spot)Day 10 of asking the @cavs for a @cediosman City Edition Jersey, since you can’t buy them. @cavs https://t.co/EbWBayc8AH@BrettMercuri @Mcdzzdachef @EdGreenberger @cavs I don’t care why he pumped. It’s not unreasonable to expect a number one overall pick to be able to pump fake w/o fumbling. 

I’m done here. You’re clearly all in on baker and that’s fine. He’s mediocre and ik it’s hard to accept- I’m clearly not going 2 change ur mind@BIGFACTS16 @Mcdzzdachef @EdGreenberger @cavs No, he should’ve held onto it. I asked a simple question. Why’d he pump instead of throw right away? It’s evident the more I speak with people the mess they understand any nuance whatsoever in QB and pass catchers playNBA teams that have been heavily impacted by players out with #COVID19 this season: Chicago Bulls, Milwaukee Bucks, Cleveland Cavaliers, Brooklyn Nets, Philadelphia 76ers, Toronto Raptors, Indiana Pacers, Memphis Grizzlies@BrettMercuri @Mcdzzdachef @EdGreenberger @cavs Lmao I watch more football than you so you can drop the education bs. Congratulations your number one pick missed a wide open TD because of a miscommunication that changes a lot 👍@BrettMercuri @Mcdzzdachef @EdGreenberger @cavs Okay? I would expect a first overall pick to communicate with his receivers?? I don’t really care why it’s in the dirt like I said same final result.@cavs @Timberwolves @BallySportsCLE @betwayusa mf w tonight😈@BrettMercuri @Mcdzzdachef @EdGreenberger @cavs Oh for Christ sake you’re STILL blaming someone else for baker fumbling the ball untouched??? You’re hopeless dude have fun I’m done here.Friday night plans!

📺 @BallySportsCLE 

@betwayusa | #GetItLocked https://t.co/SIPdGY1iev@BIGFACTS16 @Mcdzzdachef @EdGreenberger @cavs On the COMMUNICATION aspect of what he wanted him to do.@BrettMercuri @Mcdzzdachef @EdGreenberger @cavs Ummm baker literally takes blame in this article my man. I don’t really care if it was under thrown or bad communication by him, a ball in the dirt is a ball in the dirt. https://t.co/jCvA4plt0S@BIGFACTS16 @Mcdzzdachef @EdGreenberger @cavs Tu further your education here’s a miscommunication from a WB on an 10-2(?) team. Same type of thing. https://t.co/bSTCK13MI1@BIGFACTS16 @Mcdzzdachef @EdGreenberger @cavs Why’d Baker double clutch on that fumble? Funny how one fumble trumps 6 drops and a WR fumble isn’t it?@MerkDip69 @cavs This is so cursed but I love it@BrettMercuri @Mcdzzdachef @EdGreenberger @cavs Conveniently leaving out the baker fumble I see. So it’s objs fault and once he’s traded it’s still everyone else’s fault? Got it. This is embarrassing.@BIGFACTS16 @Mcdzzdachef @EdGreenberger @cavs So now that I know your take, here’s your education. Baker wanted a stop route to end the game. OBJ kept running. It’s a communication issue. Stop route ends the game on kneel downs. https://t.co/NwRie3OgLNWhat is the mid-season review of Cleveland Cavaliers? #NBA

https://t.co/CnAv6qPoWR@BIGFACTS16 @Mcdzzdachef @EdGreenberger @cavs 6 drops and a WR fumble. This has been discussed multiple times. Even by a HOF QB https://t.co/YxdqiB3tuF@cavs @socios @_bigjayy_ @Starrelish I did not know I needed this and now I need it on my wall@BrettMercuri @Mcdzzdachef @EdGreenberger @cavs The ball thrown badly behind obj?@TheRealHuppOG @cavs Very true but he is a great offensive punch off the bench and probably our best 3 point shooter@BrettMercuri @Mcdzzdachef @EdGreenberger @cavs Hint- we don’t score at all. Lamar throws 4 picks and we score 10 points the whole game. Maybe you’ll find a way to bring obj into this.@BrettMercuri @Mcdzzdachef @EdGreenberger @cavs The amount of catches by obj is not why baker is good/bad or why stafford is good/bad. 

Here’s a stat for you. PPG over the last 3 games (post-obj trade)

Rams: 25 (11th in nfl)
Browns: 10 (32nd in the nfl 🤣)

Obj probably has very little to do with it. Mayfield isn’t good.@BIGFACTS16 @Mcdzzdachef @EdGreenberger @cavs To make it easier it’s Vs Minnesota@BIGFACTS16 @Mcdzzdachef @EdGreenberger @cavs Explain the first pass in that video.@BIGFACTS16 @Mcdzzdachef @EdGreenberger @cavs You were the one that rambled on about TDs. Hint - we run them in rather than do 1 yard throws. My point stands overall a 50% catch rate is a 50% catch rate. Not good and it’s 2 teams now.@BrettMercuri @Mcdzzdachef @EdGreenberger @cavs Okay so you’re allowed to pepper me with video links as your argument but I can’t mention a literal lowlight compilation of baker? Got it. Keep defending him it’ll be funnier when he’s gone in a year tops.No. 5 in the NBA Math player power rankings:

Jarrett Allen, Cleveland Cavaliers: 20.87

https://t.co/cMK94AC48A https://t.co/IDfSZ8FWqc@BrettMercuri @Mcdzzdachef @EdGreenberger @cavs I’m only going to say it one more time. BOTH PLAYERS ARE AVERAGE AT BEST. Browns fans like yourself that place the entire blame on baker or obj don’t know football. It’s a mix@BIGFACTS16 @Mcdzzdachef @EdGreenberger @cavs You missed the point completely by mentioning OBJs dad.25. Malcolm Brogdon, Indiana Pacers: 16.05

24. Russell Westbrook, Los Angeles Lakers: 16.29

23. Zach LaVine, Chicago Bulls: 16.61

22. Darius Garland, Cleveland Cavaliers: 16.63

https://t.co/cMK94AC48A https://t.co/5ZDUt0Xl12@DavidZavac Why doesn’t David believe in the Cleveland Cavaliers?@BIGFACTS16 @Mcdzzdachef @EdGreenberger @cavs OBJ is a glutton for awful throws. The point is maybe just maybe - it wasn’t Mayfield. Because if it is Mayfield - then it’s also Stafford@nizcomix @JScottShep @cavs @keybank Re read it slower this time@BIGFACTS16 @Mcdzzdachef @EdGreenberger @cavs Seriously pay attention. OBJs daddy said Mayfield couldn’t get OBJ the ball and that’s why he was 17/34 catching it. Got him off the team.

With the Rams now he’s 9/18 catches. 50% catch rate. 

Who’s the constant? The QB or the WR?@BrettMercuri @Mcdzzdachef @EdGreenberger @cavs You’re an idiot Brett. I’ve told you 5 times now that obj isn’t good. Neither is baker. I could bring up the tape of baker missing wide open receivers or not throwing to them at all (thanks to OBJs dad).@BrettMercuri @Mcdzzdachef @EdGreenberger @cavs Yes obj isn’t very good I already told you that myself multiple times. But guess what- getting rid of him hasn’t helped baker at all. Baker is mediocre at best and we took him with the first overall pick. That’s it. Nothing more.@BrettMercuri @Mcdzzdachef @EdGreenberger @cavs Okay what are you trying to prove with this one? Legitimately awful throw by stafford here 🤣@BrettMercuri @Mcdzzdachef @EdGreenberger @cavs I can’t even see where the ball is placed in this video. I already told you it’s a mix of issues but I could pull up the crap baker throw for a wide open obj vs Vikings. Obj isn’t what he used to be, baker is not good. Both can be true@EdGreenberger @cavs I mean eh he beat oh state so what has nothing to do with the prosI've been searching all over the league to figure out who is and isn't available for the Cleveland Cavaliers when things open next week for trades.

#GamblingTwitter https://t.co/ZZAH251RiN@BrettMercuri @Mcdzzdachef @EdGreenberger @cavs A touchdowns a touchdown. Baker sailed passes over his head (yes the Pittsburgh one was a bad throw and I’m not arguing about it). If you’re fine with mediocre play from a first overall pick then fine. He’s not living up to his draft position. Period.@BIGFACTS16 @Mcdzzdachef @EdGreenberger @cavs And? One was 1 yard. Catch rate 50%. Baker catch rate 50%@AbelFCano @ianmirmelstein @EdGreenberger @cavs Yeah I get the injuries at the beginning of the season but at a certain point the injury excuses have to stop. It’s week 14, nobody is 100% 🤷‍♂️@nizcomix @cavs @keybank I'll admit to not really following that one. But I'm sorry if I was too pricky.@nizcomix @cavs @keybank How many guys in the east are averaging 19/8 and 40% from 3? Those aren't cherrypicked at all, they're pretty standard.@BIGFACTS16 @ianmirmelstein @EdGreenberger @cavs Especially with his GM and head coach saying he’s absolutely healthy enough to play and succeed.@nizcomix @cavs @keybank There. Are. Three. People. At 19/8 and over 47% shooting. He's one of three. How are those numbers not what they used to be if only 3 guys in the league have them? Sorry if I'm going dicky but you're frustrating.@cavs @tackofall99 Happy birthday, Tacko!@nizcomix @cavs @keybank I was trying to be kind.@nizcomix @cavs @keybank Honestly? Kinda.@nizcomix @cavs @keybank I'm saying he has the numbers and passes every eyeball test. In a fair world, he's an all star. 19/8 and over 40% from 3 makes him an all star. The only reason he gets left off is it's a next-year thing because that is kind of how it works.@tekmunnee @nbattack @cavs Let's cash this fellas!@nizcomix @cavs @keybank No, you said I said you don't watch games. I just assumed you hadn't seen Garland. Quite a huge difference. And don't use "bruh" if you're over 15.@nizcomix @cavs @keybank He's not perfect but he's pretty terrific. The handles, passing, and shot are elite, the numbers put him in rare territory, the Cavs are winning and he's their leader at 21. Add it up... and it equals all star.@nizcomix @cavs @keybank Where? I said you haven't watched Garland. We've already established that he's one of 3 with those numbers, so he's an All Star on paper. As an act of kindness, I was assuming you hadn't seen him play because the only alternative is you dumb.@nizcomix @Cavs_House @cavs @keybank I started with him being one of 3 players in the league with 19+, 8+, and 47%+. He's rare. Am I missing something, how is that not by definition and all star?@nizcomix @cavs @keybank You haven't watched him then. He's a legit 20/8 guy with insane handles and a great 3-point shooter. Legit all star, no doubt, just a matter of whether he's done it for long enough.Professional Spanish basketball player Ricky Rubio wore a t-shirt in support of those affected by the eruption in La Palma, for the Cleveland Cavaliers basketball team 😲

Dilfer had one of the best defenses of all time, Foles had a great defense and I would also argue baker hasn’t reached peak Foles level. Foles made the throws that needed to be made. Baker generally doesn’t. Next.@Cavs_House @T_Rosen_TPP @cavs @keybank Why should we leave them alone? They should be better@nizcomix @Cavs_House @JScottShep @cavs @keybank Why do you hate Garland?@nizcomix @JScottShep @cavs @keybank Just because there are guards better doesn't mean he's not a allstar@T_Rosen_TPP @cavs @keybank Leave the browns alone....last year you probably said vice versa@BIGFACTS16 @Mcdzzdachef @EdGreenberger @cavs Nick Foles isn’t a super bowl winner and neither is Trent Dilfer right? You realize Aaron Rodgers has only 1 Super Bowl win right? You know how hard it is to win and more often than not defense is the key even though they always give MVP to QB? 12 drops is in a 2 game stretch 8-4@nizcomix @JScottShep @cavs @keybank You obviously are not a good judge of allstar talent@BigZo07 @cavs He’s still overpaid and getting old@representus @StephenCurry30 @NBACoalition As a lifelong fan of the @cavs, @StephenCurry30 hasn't always been a favorite.

@KeyBank | #LetEmKnowChris Finch on the Cleveland Cavaliers:

"Unique team. Really like this team. JB has done an amazing job with these guys and his staff. Like how they play. You can see the effect that Ricky's had on them there. They really move the ball. They play with a high IQ."@ElalcaldeRafa @JohnTelich8 @tackofall99 @cavs Dios mio that’s quite a picture 🤣@BrettMercuri @Mcdzzdachef @EdGreenberger @cavs Trust me I’ve watched and rewatched every game this year. 17 drops on the year is top half of the NFL. Baker just isn’t very good I’m sorry. I’m sure he could make another playoff appearance but he isn’t a SB winner@BrettMercuri @Mcdzzdachef @EdGreenberger @cavs If there’s one thing Landry can do it’s run routes. Baker will still sail it cough cough lions game.@BrettMercuri @Mcdzzdachef @EdGreenberger @cavs He definitely does count. Talented receiver who isn’t built for stefanskis system. Even if he’s washed now he wasn’t when we brought him in. He’s also caught a TD each of the last 2 weeks.@cavs @SociosHoops Yes. It’s wet. Just like Oil is Oily.@CavsTeamShop @KidCudi @cavs @BleacherReport Reminds me of these awful jerseys. https://t.co/y7R1RHgMRA@BIGFACTS16 @Mcdzzdachef @EdGreenberger @cavs Sorry OBJ doesn’t count. He’s a washed up has been at the same catch rate with Stafford. Yes on Diggs:Thielen I’m fully awareForgot to mentioned the other day @cavs beat the @chicagobulls what a game what a performance@BIGFACTS16 @Mcdzzdachef @EdGreenberger @cavs I’m not asking for prolific. I’m asking for route running and actually catching the ball.@BrettMercuri @Mcdzzdachef @EdGreenberger @cavs That would require getting him the ball… Browns are a run first and throw to the TE team, period. We aren’t going to have a prolific receiver in stefanskis system. Ask Stefon Diggs or OBJ. https://t.co/8QHeFTxSVw@DanielAGreen1 @nbatopshot Cleveland cavaliers surprised 😮

Ts: Sokmaro 
@zafpinto @HarisXir@BIGFACTS16 @Mcdzzdachef @EdGreenberger @cavs Catch up kitten. Unless you don’t actually watch the games - the Browns dropped 6 vs Steelers with a WR fumble and 6 vs Ravens with a WR fumble. Change that and we are 8-4. I’m literally referring to 2 games.The @cavs have a 92.3% chance of making the playoffs is insane. We’re back!! #LetEmKnow https://t.co/wN0d9pdkFS@BIGFACTS16 @Mcdzzdachef @EdGreenberger @cavs I know how it’s built. If you know who the TE are you’ll see I listed 2 of them (bc Bryant’s name escaped me at the time). It doesn’t mean WR shouldn’t catch the ball does it?Hi @KidCudi @cavs @KingJames @BleacherReport The capsule jersey is sold out. But I have a request: my son, born in March in Cleveland, spend his 2 first month in intensive care. He was a real fighter, and is now a beautiful baby. HE’S MY CHOOSEN ONE. Can you be his Santa Claus?@BrettMercuri @Mcdzzdachef @EdGreenberger @cavs How’s this for full detail? Browns have 13 drops ON THE SEASON. The defense has shown up more often than the offense and the only complete team effort I’ve seen was the cinci game. If we’re going to have this convo u can’t be making up stats.

@feritjobs@BrettMercuri @Mcdzzdachef @EdGreenberger @cavs You don’t understand football. Stefanskis offense is BUILT AROUJD THE TE’s. If you have an issue with the receivers around him than bring it up with stefanski. Baker has still gotten worse month by month.@John_Sabol @AmicoHoops @cavs @CavsJoeG @CavsOnTheBreak @Cavsanada @thechasesmith This is common knowledge to Cavs fans. They had just recently had Daugherty and Nance retire early and had traded Hot Rod Williams.

I’m not talking about most Browns fans, though. I’m talking about the small, incredibly vocal contingent on Twitter that falls into the category.@EdGreenberger @cavs Who in the name of our Lord is still talking about this@EdGreenberger @cavs I forgot about that the day the Browns drafted Baker Mayfield.

When the Browns lose it’s they. First it was offense system. Then coach. Then offensive line. Then injuries. Then wide receivers. To his stans its never Mayfield. He’s the only constant in all of those events.@BallySportsCLE @_bigjayy_ @cavs Initially, I didn't know much about Jarrett Allen when he was first traded here. The dude plays his ass off and seems like a genuinely good person. This team just seems to have very good chemistry on and off the court.

Hope it's a great one!@cavs @tackofall99 HAPPY BIRTHDAY TACKO@Rel_clutch @CP_1972 @acolby215 @EdGreenberger @cavs The fact you find it surprising that only 20 points were scored in a game with 12 drops and 2 WR fumbled says you don’t understand the game very much. Repeat after me. If a team had 6 drops per game that would equate to 102 for a season. Do you think that team will score a lot?@Rel_clutch @CP_1972 @acolby215 @EdGreenberger @cavs So your excuse is that the offense took advantage of turnovers. Remember when you bitched last week about Baker and ignored drops and complained because we scored 3 off 4 takeaways? Any questions?@LeVirginJames @Nezzzooooo @lolimshi @NBA @tackofall99 @cavs U still mad he left Cleveland 🤡 bozo@cavs @tackofall99 Happy Birthday Tacko 🌮 Fall!@NBA @tackofall99 @cavs Happy bday@NBA @tackofall99 @cavs Future Allstar@NBA @tackofall99 @cavs Happy birthday Tacko 🌮@NBA @tackofall99 @cavs Happy Birthday!@cavs @tackofall99 Hbd to the tackster@cavs @tackofall99 Happy Birthday@Nezzzooooo @lolimshi @NBA @tackofall99 @cavs lemickey jokes are funny deal with it https://t.co/y6n4YHOthY@cavs @tackofall99 Goated@cavs @tackofall99 Happy birthday Tacgoat Fall@cavs @tackofall99 Happy birthday goat@BrettMercuri @CP_1972 @acolby215 @EdGreenberger @cavs 10 pts in both those games.

And if you refuse that means you think he’s throwing to Jerry Rice at every position.@BrettMercuri @CP_1972 @acolby215 @EdGreenberger @cavs It’s the truth Baker’s best year was average and he was 30th in completion %@acolby215 @EdGreenberger @cavs Curious can you or anyone who likes your post explain how drops and player fumbles that end drives are the fault of the QB ? How is a WR fumble a QBs fault? How are drops a QBs fault?@TheRealHuppOG @cavs Not going to Lie KLove has played in such a way I think we need to keep him... And plus I've seen him get busy in the playoffs before@Mcdzzdachef @BIGFACTS16 @EdGreenberger @cavs Hey look an OSU fan hating Mayfield for flag planting!@BIGFACTS16 @Mcdzzdachef @EdGreenberger @cavs So you’re saying the 12 drops between Pitt/Balt means he played bad? Explain in full detail.@Rel_clutch @CP_1972 @acolby215 @EdGreenberger @cavs Fantasy football logic.@Rel_clutch @EdGreenberger @acolby215 @cavs Stefanski typically plays in a 15 yard box with routes. Here’s a 3rd down 5 wide route. Let me know what you notice. In detail. https://t.co/iuJpiuEcBg@Rel_clutch @EdGreenberger @acolby215 @cavs So 3 3rd down drops in one game that hit guys square in the hands are the QBs fault. Thanks for correcting me that drops are on the QB and it’s the QBs job to throw and catch.@EdGreenberger @BrettMercuri @acolby215 @cavs Ignore the fact that the qb has been figured out, everybody sends the house on 3rd down because he is one of the worst qbs against the blitz@BallySportsCLE @_bigjayy_ @cavs Would love to watch but, like half the viewing area, I cannot because I stream my tv content. Losing a generation of fans.@EdGreenberger @BrettMercuri @acolby215 @cavs I did lmao &amp; now its stefanski’s offense 😭😭 I can’t with y’all man 🤦🏾‍♂️@CP_1972 @BrettMercuri @acolby215 @EdGreenberger @cavs He was in fact lmao.

Speakers volumes.@EdGreenberger @cavs Tim couch had a good year I’m 02 led the browns to the playoffs. How’d that work out.

So fans of a laughingstock team that went 0-16 in 2017 and 38-122 over the past decade get a QB who goes 28-28, including an 11-5 playoff year in 2020, and 6-6 this year still in the hunt, and now they somehow just HATE the guy?

  Cleveland has always managed to make every experience a negative one.

  Winning the Title bought a couple of days of peace, before people started complaining again.

  @KingJames was on 1 year contracts and fans were trying to run him off... again.@EdGreenberger @cavs What’s the reason? Tired of all the talk and posturing while not putting up numbers?

By the way, try tweeting at the other guy.@JustinTbao @KidCudi @cavs @mitchell_ness I need this, but god $175 is just a lot@BrownsFutures @EdGreenberger @Jaysipher @GSpitzig @BuckeyeRP @woodrowsackman @Rye_Rye_Rocco_ @cavs Until the day I die!ALERT: New high roller bet posted!

Wow what a shot.@BrownsFutures @EdGreenberger @Jaysipher @GSpitzig @BuckeyeRP @woodrowsackman @Rye_Rye_Rocco_ @cavs I honestly don’t know who anyone is in this thread. Hahahaha. Do I hate that baker and OU beat OSU and planted the flag on my wedding night? Yes I do. But would I be pissed if baker and the browns won the SB?! Fuck no I wouldn’t be pissed.@lanzarotelandia @cavs @SociosHoops I have had cold sweaters before bro@EdGreenberger @Jaysipher @GSpitzig @BuckeyeRP @woodrowsackman @Rye_Rye_Rocco_ @cavs @markburchett1 Show me the significant number of people who are so bitter about the flag planting that they’ll hate if Baker wins a SB for the Browns and we’ll ask them too. I’d rather let them explain their position than argue about assumptions.@zdubb7895 @cavs By the way, why are you following me?@zdubb7895 @cavs What is that job exactly?@FruitPunchMarlo @cavs @evanmobley I imagine Mobley looks like what Kevin Durant looked like at age 20. Smooth and graceful.@EdGreenberger @cavs U seem very average at your job #dbag@tmb237 @cavs Yawn. So many incredibly unfunny people on Twitter.@EdGreenberger @cavs Keep grasping at straws my friend. No one cares about that.@zdubb7895 @cavs You seem nice.@BrownsFutures @Jaysipher @GSpitzig @BuckeyeRP @woodrowsackman @Rye_Rye_Rocco_ @cavs @markburchett1 Great. That’s one guy. Do you really think there aren’t others who still feel that way? Have you read some of the hate on Twitter? Not disappointment. Not frustration. Straight-up contempt for a QB who won a playoff game last year. Explain that contempt it to me if you can.@HoopShots12 @ShannonSharpe @cavs @Lakers They just arent well constructed.  Seen this movie in Cleveland for half a season.  Remember the DWade, Drose, Jcrowder and friends experiment?   It was done by trade deadline.   This LA version may be too.@EdGreenberger @cavs That’s all it is is an idea. More like a pipe dream. Regardless baker isn’t gonna sleep with you Ed@RandyNBCLA @ShannonSharpe @cavs The more I watch this future HOFers with this @Lakers team, the more I miss KOBE BRYANT! #MambaMentality #MambaForever@Jaysipher @EdGreenberger @GSpitzig @BuckeyeRP @woodrowsackman @Rye_Rye_Rocco_ @cavs @markburchett1 Makes perfect sense sir! Thanks for the clarification. Go Browns! 

@EdGreenberger 👀@BrownsFutures @EdGreenberger @GSpitzig @BuckeyeRP @woodrowsackman @Rye_Rye_Rocco_ @cavs @markburchett1 nope i'd be miserable and distraught! LOL no I'd be hype as fuck that tweet old asf anyways, I'm almost positive I have a tweet forgiving Baker lmfao. like yeah I'm a big college guy right but if you bring CLE a ring imma love you@ShannonSharpe Get that ol thang back with the @CavsIs this the mid 2000’s Cleveland Cavaliers?! https://t.co/rC72RvoKos@EdGreenberger @cavs It makes you sit back and think if Cleveland fans truly did deserve that 52 year drought and all the shots we took from national media over the years. So many ungrateful fans in this city who will turn their back on you quickly, most of them are alcoholics, too. Lol. https://t.co/AFtURD03vW@EdGreenberger @cavs I don’t think you have to worry about that anytime soonNeed one of those @mitchell_ness x @KidCudi @cavs jerseys!@MrZZZ30 @NBA @cavs He’s very good defensively, I just have a hard time calling a rookie elite 20+ games into their NBA career.@EdGreenberger @cavs The flag plant will ALWAYS irritate me. HOWEVER, he's our QB now and I enjoy every win. Winning the AFC title game will be the greatest day ever, only topped by a Superbowl win. I hate Xichigan more than the flag plant, yet I root for DPJ, Leroy Hoard, &amp; Steve Everett.@brianresnik @cavs Yes… some Browns fans. And Karlis didn’t miss.i live in a world where the Cleveland Cavaliers are the best sports team i root for.@okudah_szn @cavs @evanmobley No.  There were some players who could have back in the day - Wilt Chamberlain and Wes Unseld in particular - but the dpoy didn't exist.@sethry16 @AbelFCano @cavs So, some Browns/Buckeye fans hate him with a white hot passion because he’s… immature?@BallySportsCLE @cavs @DreKnott THEMARKSMAN CAVS#24 https://t.co/sHwHtVv6nX@UnfrozenVaughn @EdGreenberger @AbelFCano @cavs Like I said, immature.@Cavsanada @cavs Starting line up looking at NBA small ball pace and space trend https://t.co/yHIVu0UYzS@EdGreenberger @cavs 0 Browns fans would be unable to enjoy it lmao@EdGreenberger @hylander91 @cavs Knucklehead.@cavs @BallySportsCLE @DreKnott @evanmobley THE MARKSMAN  CAVS # 24 https://t.co/Bfqjpsmk9Q@CavsTeamShop @KidCudi @cavs @BleacherReport Make youngboy jerseys@Lakers have 3 superstars

And they still shit 
I wonder if @KingJames will join the @BrooklynNets or @Suns or go back to @cavs or @MiamiHEAT@cavs can u guys teach the @Lakers how to play defense@EdGreenberger @cavs Flag bounce maybe@rayrat1747 @NBA @cavs Above average?! He's already Elite!@AndreaCollins84 @cavs That is one HAPPY kid!@ohiobourbon1 @cavs Because that’s what you get.@EdGreenberger @cavs Who is this guy and why is he in my timeline now@cavs do not be cowards. We know you got it. https://t.co/HYHyBxBMWoThis is former @cavs star Ron Harpers son, Ron Jr. Just beat Purdue at the buzzer !!   https://t.co/rRB2kMozk4@KelTraut @JohnTelich8 @cavs @fox8news They have no idea why it’s called return.@BigZo07 @cavs Draft picks. Cash in on K love@TheRealHuppOG @cavs They have to make several moves but the bad part is who are you going to give up🤔@AuthorHorror @Mcdzzdachef @EdGreenberger @cavs They won't. All you have to do is note the name is an OSU reference. Baker could go 20-25 with 10 TDs in a loss and they'd blame him. It's all about the flag for them. Your point was spot on.@BigZo07 @cavs Exactly. Plus depth helps in case of injury or foul trouble. We definitely lack in three point shooting@TheRealHuppOG @cavs Yeah man. And in the Playoffs they will just double Garland and take him out the game@EdGreenberger @cavs You put superbowl and baker mayfield in the same sentence. 

it’s a terrible time to construct a tweet like that, with someone of your stature. 

Unless you were going for that of course.@BigZo07 @cavs We definitely need more guards and depth. We literally have like 7 dudes who barely play@RickMalloyjr1 @cavs We’re talking about the ones who loathe Baker and make it obvious in their tweets. There’s only one reason for that kind of hate. The guy led this team to the playoffs 11 months ago and won their 1st playoff game in 30 years — in Pittsburgh, no less.It’s official, I am now a Cleveland Cavaliers fan@TheRealHuppOG @cavs I really wish we could get Levert because then we might go further than the 2nd rd. But presently constructed I think we lose in the 1st rd in a seven game series@MLxBknms @CavsTeamShop @cavs @KidCudi @BleacherReport Thanks man!@dddaily5 @cavs Reading all the Baker vitriol on Twitter. This isn’t a new topic. It’s been discussed many times this season and last year as well.@Mcdzzdachef @BrettMercuri @EdGreenberger @cavs Would you please take a minute and look at what I wrote. It was a commentating about the phallacy that good QB's consistently win games in the last 2 minutes- that is simply not true. I didn't say a word about Baker- obsessed much.@EdGreenberger @cavs BrownsBuckeye fans don’t care about the flag plant. They don’t like mayfield because he isn’t winning games, hasn’t lived up to expectations and isn’t a good quarterback.@EdGreenberger @cavs What prompted you to tweet this out of the blue? Seems like a desperate attempt at getting attention. Maybe there are two fans that feel that way but once out of college and on an nfl roster, most people can care less.@FrankJJustice @cavs I’m telling you it’s possible to be both.@ianmirmelstein @EdGreenberger @cavs My point was in reference to the browns having such a terrible past. This front office won’t take that into consideration when making decisions. I trust Andrew Berry to make the right decisions for this franchise. I think he’ll unsuccessfully swing for the fences this offseason@IcemanMAT_E_J @cavs @RMFieldHouse You should ask @CavsMoondog.@BallySportsCLE @_bigjayy_ @cavs Love your 3 pointers!!!@AbelFCano @EdGreenberger @cavs When evaluating a QB, to say previous years don’t matter is crazy.  Who would you like to replace Mayfield with?@BraydenBallin At this point the Cleveland Cavaliers are playing very well in all phases of the game. They enjoy each other‘s company &amp; are growing as a team. They are winning games vs playoff caliber teams. Don’t see a reason for them to make a trade. Let it play out for now. Chemistry is good@ChuckGobrowns @cavs I believe that we have to make a few moves to get more depth but it’s definitely a possibility🚨🍺EPISODE 94🍺🚨

The guys are joined by the host of the @ChaseDownPod - @Cavsanada to talk about the PHENOMENAL start to the season for the @Cavs!

Thank you and CHEERS! 

#LetEmKnow #Cavs #NBA https://t.co/4dMyJk7Egr@FrankJJustice @cavs Nope. They exist. I interacted with some on Twitter back then. Small group, but they’re around.@TheRealHuppOG @cavs I would say it’s possible@dddaily5 @cavs Yes. You honestly don’t think there’s a group of OSU fans who hated him so much for the flag thing that they can’t root for him no matter what? Football fans are completely irrational about QBs.Y’all think the @cavs can win a playoff series?Kid Cudi x Cleveland Cavaliers Merch is out now!!!! I NEED https://t.co/1WATC1q8Wq@TedTraut @JohnTelich8 @cavs @fox8news Haha. You’re about to get a lot of millennial hate@EdGreenberger @cavs Does anyone honestly think of this anymore. I am not a huge buckeyes fan but I completely forgot about this happening. Weak take from this Ed guy. Almost like Baker put you up to it.@cavs @SociosHoops To be wet is to be saturated in a liquid. Water itself can not be saturated meaning it can not be wet.Day 2 of asking the @Cavs for a follow back@cavs @SociosHoops The ultimate debate! Here we go again!@JohnTelich8 @cavs @fox8news I just appreciate the 2 spaces after each sentence.  Old school.I see you @cavs ! https://t.co/pce9l1hjpj@ClutchRipz He also beat the greatest team of all time with the CLEVELAND CAVALIERSLet me just say, I know the @Browns have tended to suck this season, but they are still better than Pittsburgh. 

C'mon @Cavs!@ianmirmelstein @EdGreenberger @cavs I was born a Browns fan and am 37 years old thank you very much.@AbelFCano @EdGreenberger @cavs Lol indeed kiddo!   Talk to me after you’ve experienced something like 1999-2018!@EdGreenberger @cavs Pretty sure nobody cares about that.@EdGreenberger @cavs Let's not get ahead of ourselves. (Looks at Ravens, Bengals, Steelers, Browns)Wait, what? @cavs have the 3rd best chance to make the playoffs? https://t.co/gbcszHPUYu@BallySportsCLE @_bigjayy_ @cavs This man broke the 4th wall while mic’d up.

Love this kid!LeBron James, who many people say is the greatest basketball player of all time, playing for the Lakers makes America seem like it’s getting kinda sloppy @cavs.@tjones_05 Not everyone knows. Half the fans can't watch thanks to RSNs. Can't stream the gms. #LetEmWATCH @NBA @cavs@EdGreenberger @cavs You are referring to football fans. Mayfield could take a dump on their front lawn if he could convert third and long. The bigger problem is he was picked first overall instead of a mid to late round pick which was warranted@EdGreenberger @cavs I'm a  buckeye fan and i don't care about the flag . I'm more concerned why the Buckeyes wasn't  ready to beat Michigan's ass 2 weeks ago https://t.co/1UbEHlKafX@EdGreenberger @GSpitzig @BuckeyeRP @woodrowsackman @Rye_Rye_Rocco_ @cavs @markburchett1 Hey @Jaysipher can you help us out here, if the Browns win a Super Bowl with Baker will you enjoy it?@cavs @evanmobley @fuboTV (That could actually block shots)@EdGreenberger @cavs I don't think they have to worry about Baker winning a SB.@cavs @SociosHoops Water is without a doubt wet. Just because anything it touches or gets on then becomes wet, so it has the wet property itself. #watergang@cavs @evanmobley @fuboTV Please, share the rookies this team has had since lebron 🤭@ChiefWahoo22 @cavs @Slimdog @TLuvsBaseball @iamkrang @OspreysFB @DirtDawg80 @dripordie_ @Cmd_Guap1 @miggy_roman @Shakabrodie @ElShaungo_ @BRKCP_ @mexi38 @Catoishere That’s was quick! 🙌🏽🤣🤣 https://t.co/G3p9kkfu77
