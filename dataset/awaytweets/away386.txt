Not just flipping shit, I'm curious how many PGs in the East are scoring over 18, assisting over 7, and shooting over 40% from 3. Just numbers that hit me as a pretty formidable combo.@nizcomix @Cavs_House @cavs @keybank Any thresholds are arbitrary but if you tell me a PG is scoring 18+, assisting 7+, and shooting 40+ from 3, I know he's at least in the all star discussion. Relative to other PGs in the East, DG's numbers slot him very high.Because I like you, I have FREE @Cavs tix this hour on my show.  Tune in at 5:25 to find out how to win @Star102CLE https://t.co/p2TL3wI33e@rodrigue700 @cavs @keybank I don't think so he isn't shown he deserves it thru the cavs rebuild he's been disappointed he was supposed to be the cavs main star but he didn't do enough but they should appreciate him for helping bring them a championship im a cavs fan and I don't think he deserves it@nizcomix @Cavs_House @cavs @keybank Can you reword that somehow? We said he's one of just 3 guys with 19/8/45% or better. His PG numbers are rare, and it's fine if you wanna say 19/8 and 40%+ from 3. They're at the top. Those are the All Stars. You're just confusing me.@cavs had a missed opportunity with the Cudi collab. woulda wished we added some trippy pinks and purples while also keeping the classic navy. kinda like the MOTM3. they couldve even incorporated the yellows and maroons in spots but idk im not a fashion designer@cavs @keybank I hate when lame casual cavs fans bash sexton for no reason I'm glad garland is playing good he's showing us the reason why the cavs drafted him none of these lame casual cavs fans on youtube are giving sexton credit all their saying is "trade him"smh4 Teamer Friday‚Äôs ‚Ä¢ +1400 Parlay üèÜ

You just said I‚Äôm an ‚Äúall Baker‚Äù or ‚Äúall OBJ‚Äù fault with no in between yet here you are ‚Äúall Baker‚Äù You don‚Äôt care about the other players, QB only.

It‚Äôs not unreasonable to expect a number one overall pick to be able to pump fake w/o fumbling. 

I‚Äôm done here. You‚Äôre clearly all in on baker and that‚Äôs fine. He‚Äôs mediocre and ik it‚Äôs hard to accept- I‚Äôm clearly not going 2 change ur mind@BIGFACTS16 @Mcdzzdachef @EdGreenberger @cavs No, he should‚Äôve held onto it. I asked a simple question. Why‚Äôd he pump instead of throw right away? It‚Äôs evident the more I speak with people the mess they understand any nuance whatsoever in QB and pass catchers playNBA teams that have been heavily impacted by players out with #COVID19 this season: Chicago Bulls, Milwaukee Bucks, Cleveland Cavaliers, Brooklyn Nets, Philadelphia 76ers, Toronto Raptors, Indiana Pacers, Memphis Grizzlies@BrettMercuri @Mcdzzdachef @EdGreenberger @cavs Lmao I watch more football than you so you can drop the education bs.

I don‚Äôt really care if it was under thrown or bad communication by him, a ball in the dirt is a ball in the dirt. https://t.co/jCvA4plt0S@BIGFACTS16 @Mcdzzdachef @EdGreenberger @cavs Tu further your education here‚Äôs a miscommunication from a WB on an 10-2(?) team. Same type of thing. https://t.co/bSTCK13MI1@BIGFACTS16 @Mcdzzdachef @EdGreenberger @cavs Why‚Äôd Baker double clutch on that fumble? Funny how one fumble trumps 6 drops and a WR fumble isn‚Äôt it?@MerkDip69 @cavs This is so cursed but I love it@BrettMercuri @Mcdzzdachef @EdGreenberger @cavs Conveniently leaving out the baker fumble I see. So it‚Äôs objs fault and once he‚Äôs traded it‚Äôs still everyone else‚Äôs fault? Got it. This is embarrassing.@BIGFACTS16 @Mcdzzdachef @EdGreenberger @cavs So now that I know your take, here‚Äôs your education. Baker wanted a stop route to end the game. OBJ kept running. It‚Äôs a communication issue. Stop route ends the game on kneel downs. https://t.co/NwRie3OgLNWhat is the mid-season review of Cleveland Cavaliers? #NBA

https://t.co/CnAv6qPoWR@BIGFACTS16 @Mcdzzdachef @EdGreenberger @cavs 6 drops and a WR fumble. This has been discussed multiple times. Even by a HOF QB https://t.co/YxdqiB3tuF@cavs @socios @_bigjayy_ @Starrelish I did not know I needed this and now I need it on my wall@BrettMercuri @Mcdzzdachef @EdGreenberger @cavs The ball thrown badly behind obj?@TheRealHuppOG @cavs Very true but he is a great offensive punch off the bench and probably our best 3 point shooter@BrettMercuri @Mcdzzdachef @EdGreenberger @cavs Hint- we don‚Äôt score at all. Lamar throws 4 picks and we score 10 points the whole game. Maybe you‚Äôll find a way to bring obj into this.@BrettMercuri @Mcdzzdachef @EdGreenberger @cavs The amount of catches by obj is not why baker is good/bad or why stafford is good/bad. 

Here‚Äôs a stat for you. PPG over the last 3 games (post-obj trade)

Rams: 25 (11th in nfl)
Browns: 10 (32nd in the nfl ü§£)

Obj probably has very little to do with it. Mayfield isn‚Äôt good.@BIGFACTS16 @Mcdzzdachef @EdGreenberger @cavs To make it easier it‚Äôs Vs Minnesota@BIGFACTS16 @Mcdzzdachef @EdGreenberger @cavs Explain the first pass in that video.@BIGFACTS16 @Mcdzzdachef @EdGreenberger @cavs You were the one that rambled on about TDs. Hint - we run them in rather than do 1 yard throws. My point stands overall a 50% catch rate is a 50% catch rate. Not good and it‚Äôs 2 teams now.@BrettMercuri @Mcdzzdachef @EdGreenberger @cavs Okay so you‚Äôre allowed to pepper me with video links as your argument but I can‚Äôt mention a literal lowlight compilation of baker? Got it. Keep defending him it‚Äôll be funnier when he‚Äôs gone in a year tops.No. 5 in the NBA Math player power rankings:

Jarrett Allen, Cleveland Cavaliers: 20.87

https://t.co/cMK94AC48A https://t.co/IDfSZ8FWqc@BrettMercuri @Mcdzzdachef @EdGreenberger @cavs I‚Äôm only going to say it one more time. BOTH PLAYERS ARE AVERAGE AT BEST. Browns fans like yourself that place the entire blame on baker or obj don‚Äôt know football. It‚Äôs a mix@BIGFACTS16 @Mcdzzdachef @EdGreenberger @cavs You missed the point completely by mentioning OBJs dad.25. Malcolm Brogdon, Indiana Pacers: 16.05

24. Russell Westbrook, Los Angeles Lakers: 16.29

23. Zach LaVine, Chicago Bulls: 16.61

22. Darius Garland, Cleveland Cavaliers: 16.63

https://t.co/cMK94AC48A https://t.co/5ZDUt0Xl12@DavidZavac Why doesn‚Äôt David believe in the Cleveland Cavaliers?@BIGFACTS16 @Mcdzzdachef @EdGreenberger @cavs OBJ is a glutton for awful throws. The point is maybe just maybe - it wasn‚Äôt Mayfield. Because if it is Mayfield - then it‚Äôs also Stafford@nizcomix @JScottShep @cavs @keybank Re read it slower this time@BIGFACTS16 @Mcdzzdachef @EdGreenberger @cavs Seriously pay attention. OBJs daddy said Mayfield couldn‚Äôt get OBJ the ball and that‚Äôs why he was 17/34 catching it. Got him off the team.

With the Rams now he‚Äôs 9/18 catches. 50% catch rate. 

Who‚Äôs the constant? The QB or the WR?@BrettMercuri @Mcdzzdachef @EdGreenberger @cavs You‚Äôre an idiot Brett. I‚Äôve told you 5 times now that obj isn‚Äôt good. Neither is baker. I could bring up the tape of baker missing wide open receivers or not throwing to them at all (thanks to OBJs dad).@BrettMercuri @Mcdzzdachef @EdGreenberger @cavs Yes obj isn‚Äôt very good I already told you that myself multiple times. But guess what- getting rid of him hasn‚Äôt helped baker at all. Baker is mediocre at best and we took him with the first overall pick. That‚Äôs it. Nothing more.@BrettMercuri @Mcdzzdachef @EdGreenberger @cavs Okay what are you trying to prove with this one? Legitimately awful throw by stafford here ü§£@BrettMercuri @Mcdzzdachef @EdGreenberger @cavs I can‚Äôt even see where the ball is placed in this video. I already told you it‚Äôs a mix of issues but I could pull up the crap baker throw for a wide open obj vs Vikings. Obj isn‚Äôt what he used to be, baker is not good. Both can be true@EdGreenberger @cavs I mean eh he beat oh state so what has nothing to do with the prosI've been searching all over the league to figure out who is and isn't available for the Cleveland Cavaliers when things open next week for trades.

Those aren't cherrypicked at all, they're pretty standard.@BIGFACTS16 @ianmirmelstein @EdGreenberger @cavs Especially with his GM and head coach saying he‚Äôs absolutely healthy enough to play and succeed.@nizcomix @cavs @keybank There. Are. Three. People. At 19/8 and over 47% shooting. He's one of three. How are those numbers not what they used to be if only 3 guys in the league have them? Sorry if I'm going dicky but you're frustrating.@cavs @tackofall99 Happy birthday, Tacko!@nizcomix @cavs @keybank I was trying to be kind.@nizcomix @cavs @keybank Honestly? Kinda.@nizcomix @cavs @keybank I'm saying he has the numbers and passes every eyeball test. In a fair world, he's an all star. 19/8 and over 40% from 3 makes him an all star. The only reason he gets left off is it's a next-year thing because that is kind of how it works.@tekmunnee @nbattack @cavs Let's cash this fellas!@nizcomix @cavs @keybank No, you said I said you don't watch games. I just assumed you hadn't seen Garland. Quite a huge difference. And don't use "bruh" if you're over 15.@nizcomix @cavs @keybank He's not perfect but he's pretty terrific. The handles, passing, and shot are elite, the numbers put him in rare territory, the Cavs are winning and he's their leader at 21. Add it up... and it equals all star.@nizcomix @cavs @keybank Where? I said you haven't watched Garland. We've already established that he's one of 3 with those numbers, so he's an All Star on paper. As an act of kindness, I was assuming you hadn't seen him play because the only alternative is you dumb.@nizcomix @Cavs_House @cavs @keybank I started with him being one of 3 players in the league with 19+, 8+, and 47%+. He's rare. Am I missing something, how is that not by definition and all star?@nizcomix @cavs @keybank You haven't watched him then. He's a legit 20/8 guy with insane handles and a great 3-point shooter. Legit all star, no doubt, just a matter of whether he's done it for long enough.Professional Spanish basketball player Ricky Rubio wore a t-shirt in support of those affected by the eruption in La Palma, for the Cleveland Cavaliers basketball team üò≤

I‚Äôm asking for route running and actually catching the ball.@BrettMercuri @Mcdzzdachef @EdGreenberger @cavs That would require getting him the ball‚Ä¶ Browns are a run first and throw to the TE team, period.

Can you be his Santa Claus?@BrettMercuri @Mcdzzdachef @EdGreenberger @cavs How‚Äôs this for full detail? Browns have 13 drops ON THE SEASON.

See Ravens last year kick GW FG with 2 seconds left@pwilli65 @cavs I know most Browns fans support him, but there‚Äôs no way it‚Äôs 95 percent. As far as LeBron goes‚Ä¶ yes, they hated him for leaving. And a small percentage never forgave him.THURSDAY AFTERNOON PICKUPS:
@benross70 picked up Denver Nuggets PF JaMychal "Green Bean" Green (dropped New York Knicks SG Evan "Don't look up his last name" Fournier)
@TeranceMann picked up Cleveland Cavaliers SF Cedi "Cheddar" Osman

Who had the better pickup?@cavs @evanmobley this man blocks shots before they even leave peoples hands. and doesnt foul.@EdGreenberger @cavs Dude are you from Cleveland? Nobody hated Lebron homie.
They hated because he was a team jumper. Cleveland people respect loyalty. I live in Cleveland and that statement is totally false. As far as baker 95% of Cleveland fans support him. Just wish he wouldn't play hurt.Although he is from Columbus bring him back home asap make the move @cavs https://t.co/BcA6gr9Mzn@cavs @hari6on @tackofall99 Happy Birthday ‚ÄúT‚Äù@DNGxHB @BrettMercuri @cavs Wrong.

Do you think that team will score a lot?@Rel_clutch @CP_1972 @acolby215 @EdGreenberger @cavs So your excuse is that the offense took advantage of turnovers.

That being said, I would love to watch the Cavs make a splash on the home court against any of our upcoming opponents, so if this comment gets me closer to that goal, then‚Ä¶ üíßüíßüíß@CavsPIsWin @cavs @SociosHoops Wazz as usual@EdGreenberger @cavs I am Buckeye Browns fan and that moment with Baker planting that flag is great.

The problem is that QB with attitude is gone and now he is Rocky in Rocky 3 before Clubber Lang kills Mickey and knocks him out in a flashCome back to @cavs @KingJames #LakeShow doesn‚Äôt deserve your greatness. #LetEmKnowWhat a beautiful sight to see @cavs https://t.co/fWWEMmZjzz@SportsBoyTony Lima, don‚Äôt let anything distract you from the fact that the Cleveland Cavaliers have the highest % chance to win the finals out of the East.@EdGreenberger @cavs Sorry Ed this is just wrong.@BrownsFutures @markburchett1 @Jaysipher @GSpitzig @BuckeyeRP @woodrowsackman @Rye_Rye_Rocco_ @cavs Again, just give me an explanation. Just one. Can you think only one other good reason for hating this QB all season long?@EdGreenberger @markburchett1 @Jaysipher @GSpitzig @BuckeyeRP @woodrowsackman @Rye_Rye_Rocco_ @cavs Thinking you know how someone else feels better than they do is hard to defend.@RandyNBCLA @ShannonSharpe @cavs @Lakers Agreed Randy! Lakers did mortgage the youth for the one ship in 2020. Sadly.

There‚Äôs only one possible reason for that kind of hatred right now ‚Äî that they‚Äôve hated Mayfield since the beginning. And there‚Äôs only one reason a Browns fan would‚Äôve hated Mayfield from the beginning.

You probably agreed with ESPN when they said that all Cleveland fans were burning LeBron jerseys when it was like 5 idiots.@mcooney099 @cavs I‚Äôm the national media? Interesting. Bro, I‚Äôve been a Browns, Cavs and Tribe fan since 1980.@EdGreenberger @cavs What are you talking about?  No Browns fans care about this.  I'm a Browns and Buckeyes fan and liked it.  The Buckeyes deserved to be shown up for that embarrassing lack of effort.

Do you really think there aren‚Äôt others who still feel that way? Have you read some of the hate on Twitter? Not disappointment. Not frustration. Straight-up contempt for a QB who won a playoff game last year. Explain that contempt it to me if you can.@HoopShots12 @ShannonSharpe @cavs @Lakers They just arent well constructed.  Seen this movie in Cleveland for half a season.  Remember the DWade, Drose, Jcrowder and friends experiment?   It was done by trade deadline.   This LA version may be too.@EdGreenberger @cavs That‚Äôs all it is is an idea. More like a pipe dream.

So many ungrateful fans in this city who will turn their back on you quickly, most of them are alcoholics, too. Lol. https://t.co/AFtURD03vW@EdGreenberger @cavs I don‚Äôt think you have to worry about that anytime soonNeed one of those @mitchell_ness x @KidCudi @cavs jerseys!@MrZZZ30 @NBA @cavs He‚Äôs very good defensively, I just have a hard time calling a rookie elite 20+ games into their NBA career.@EdGreenberger @cavs The flag plant will ALWAYS irritate me. HOWEVER, he's our QB now and I enjoy every win. Winning the AFC title game will be the greatest day ever, only topped by a Superbowl win.

All you have to do is note the name is an OSU reference. Baker could go 20-25 with 10 TDs in a loss and they'd blame him. It's all about the flag for them. Your point was spot on.@BigZo07 @cavs Exactly. Plus depth helps in case of injury or foul trouble. We definitely lack in three point shooting@TheRealHuppOG @cavs Yeah man. And in the Playoffs they will just double Garland and take him out the game@EdGreenberger @cavs You put superbowl and baker mayfield in the same sentence. 

it‚Äôs a terrible time to construct a tweet like that, with someone of your stature. 

Unless you were going for that of course.@BigZo07 @cavs We definitely need more guards and depth. We literally have like 7 dudes who barely play@RickMalloyjr1 @cavs We‚Äôre talking about the ones who loathe Baker and make it obvious in their tweets. There‚Äôs only one reason for that kind of hate. The guy led this team to the playoffs 11 months ago and won their 1st playoff game in 30 years ‚Äî in Pittsburgh, no less.It‚Äôs official, I am now a Cleveland Cavaliers fan@TheRealHuppOG @cavs I really wish we could get Levert because then we might go further than the 2nd rd.

This isn‚Äôt a new topic. It‚Äôs been discussed many times this season and last year as well.@Mcdzzdachef @BrettMercuri @EdGreenberger @cavs Would you please take a minute and look at what I wrote. It was a commentating about the phallacy that good QB's consistently win games in the last 2 minutes- that is simply not true. I didn't say a word about Baker- obsessed much.@EdGreenberger @cavs BrownsBuckeye fans don‚Äôt care about the flag plant. They don‚Äôt like mayfield because he isn‚Äôt winning games, hasn‚Äôt lived up to expectations and isn‚Äôt a good quarterback.@EdGreenberger @cavs What prompted you to tweet this out of the blue? Seems like a desperate attempt at getting attention. Maybe there are two fans that feel that way but once out of college and on an nfl roster, most people can care less.@FrankJJustice @cavs I‚Äôm telling you it‚Äôs possible to be both.@ianmirmelstein @EdGreenberger @cavs My point was in reference to the browns having such a terrible past. This front office won‚Äôt take that into consideration when making decisions. I trust Andrew Berry to make the right decisions for this franchise. I think he‚Äôll unsuccessfully swing for the fences this offseason@IcemanMAT_E_J @cavs @RMFieldHouse You should ask @CavsMoondog.@BallySportsCLE @_bigjayy_ @cavs Love your 3 pointers!!!@AbelFCano @EdGreenberger @cavs When evaluating a QB, to say previous years don‚Äôt matter is crazy.  Who would you like to replace Mayfield with?@BraydenBallin At this point the Cleveland Cavaliers are playing very well in all phases of the game. They enjoy each other‚Äòs company &amp; are growing as a team. They are winning games vs playoff caliber teams. Don‚Äôt see a reason for them to make a trade. Let it play out for now.

Small group, but they‚Äôre around.@TheRealHuppOG @cavs I would say it‚Äôs possible@dddaily5 @cavs Yes. You honestly don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs a group of OSU fans who hated him so much for the flag thing that they can‚Äôt root for him no matter what?
