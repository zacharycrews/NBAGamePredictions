He is a very good player. I'm not sure if he will become a superstar. He does have all the tools to do so. His FT shooting has improved. 3pt shooting has regressed. He's still a great player not sure if he becomes THE GUY though.@SacramentoKings @swipathefox @socios NFTs are like Monte Mcnair.

You pay a lot of money for absolutely nothing.After posting only 75 points Tuesday, the Kings travel to State Farm Arena in Atlanta.

The Hawks have won 4 in a row, but remain 4 games below .500.

We loved those guys. Same can‚Äôt be said for this team.@BushwickSick718 @flyboiiant23 @ToddyWoddy1330 @SacramentoKings Tyrese averages 24ppg and 12 apg in games played without Fox. He is more assertive and his play is outstanding. These #'s are well above the season avg of 14/7. Roster balance is poor. Fox needs the ball &amp; Haliburton does too. We like Fox.

The Sacramento Kings was clobbered hard by the Boston Celtics, losing by 53 points as Tatum and Brown combined for 66 points. On the same day, the Washington Wizards wasted a 35-point lead and lost to the LA Clippers who was missing PG13 and Kawhi Leonard. https://t.co/DtPB9IfIfoNBA fans, am I right in saying that Tottenham are the football equivalent of the Sacramento Kings?@SacramentoKings players are just happy to be in the nba lol@SacramentoKings When I watch this team it‚Äôs so difficult to watch them jack up 3‚Äôs after 3‚Äôs continually missing .
