Webster is getting a Trudeau like pass from the media. What gives? @RaptorsRaptors will start big vs Houston with VanVleet (groin) getting the night off. It's Siakam, Trent, Barnes, Anunoby and Achiuwa.

Thad Young is not available.

I have a feeling you know this@Toronto_Sports @WalderSports @Raptors That is true I agree a superstar will be needed 

but other then dragic contract and a first not many assets to trade unless get rid of players from core… the time to make a big move will come… but ideally always hard to get superstar to Toronto@Jessicuhhh @lucarosano3 @Goran_Dragic For sure Goran Dragic is a Toronto Raptors Legend and I cannot believe that I am saying this but maybe even the best Raptor of all time over Kyle Lowry man what a GOAT.@Raptors @yungsmoove21 Let’s Go!!!!@SportsTalkTOR @Raptors @FredVanVleet @gtrentjr @OAnunoby @pskills43 @yungsmoove21 @PreciousAchiuwa @chrisboucher Did you forget Scottie Barnes?@NBACanada @Raptors Why isn’t this being broadcast in Canada?

I don’t know enough about players that aren’t on the Raps to have an opinion… Gave up another first round selection though 😬Let’s get this straight … we traded Kyle Lowry and 1st round pick for Thad young, Precious Achiuwa, Drew Eubanks and 2nd round pick … it’s a bad trade no matter how you look at it and a misstep from the Toronto raptors front office.Consensus Line Move:

Golden State Warriors 70%
Washington Wizards 63%
Phoenix Suns 62%Easily the @Raptors won the trade. 1st rd pick means nothing atm, and Dragic has only proven to be old, injury prone, and clearly not a professional. Always liked Young since his 76er days. He will be a nice fit, especially with injures/covid! #nba #NBATradeDeadline #raptorsWhy is Chris Boucher still a member of the Toronto Raptors?Don't sleep on the Toronto Raptors.
They have beaten the Bucks 3 times so far this season, and that is without their full roster.

I have no clue about the latter tbh, have a feeling it'll be something lateral for Malachi or something but that's just a guess@LeoRautins I see, @Raptors being one of the most healthy organizations in all of sports!

I apologize for using twitter to have a little fun rather than serious sports analysis.@__OGtheClampGod @Raptors But that's not the vision.

More info: https://t.co/JZGzs0QbmJ https://t.co/pLlCUsOpqmChris Boucher is the most intriguing player on the Raptors. In general, Toronto as a org are intriguing, with their schemes and lineups dominating.

However, Boucher has the most intriguing game/frame, with his shot blocking ability in his 7ft4 wingspan, improved passing/jumper@Sportsnet @Raptors @spurs @wojespn Guys like Goran Dragic and Alonzo Mourning - both who did not want to come to Toronto, costing us millions of $, and creating lopsided trades for the Raptors, BOTH should have been suspended by the league.

Spurs Receive - Goran Dragic, 2022 TOR 1st round pick*

* Toronto's first round pick is lottery protected in 2022, top 13 protected in 2023; it turns into 2 2nd rounders if it does not convey.@SXMCanadaNow at 1pm ET on @SXMCanadaTalks! Nike Exec Larry Miller on hiding his past incarceration for murder, @sarahdimuro tells us about a garbage picking club in Toronto, @bodybreak's Hal Johnson, travel expert @ElizabethBeatty &amp; @ryanpaton75 talks #Raptors. https://t.co/oydwEjKgIk@YoshiCommune @Raptors It isn't. But the lack of patience by some fans is grating. Imagine if Masai did things on that timeline and not his own. Chess&gt;checkers.My problem with the Thad deal for Toronto isn't the raw cost of an FRP. It's that THEY, specifically, gave up a first-round pick.

The Raptors are maybe the best drafters in the NBA. I'd rather give that front office another swing than add almost any 33-year-old expiring contract@ChickenCurry206 @Raptors I fw Thaddeus and Goran’s off my team so issa W for me@Raptors Please no to a 1st rounded and Thad , get rid of goran fo sure but make it player for player.Los Toronto Raptors mandan a Goran Dragic a los Spurs a cambio de Thad Young https://t.co/BKe1aKw0FF@Raptors yall gave away a first round pick for two bubblegums and a hall mint… how yall pretend to compete for a chip doing moves like that! https://t.co/vuAQ3hKten@facchini98 @NofaceTobi @Raptors Stop looking at just first for second 
Our pick is gonna be in the low twenties Detroit’s second will be low thirty’s we get young Eubanks and 3.5 million in cap it’s not as bad as it looks if you actually read into it@BootsMcGavin @Raptors Nether of the players the raptors got this trade are all starsPeople act like the buyout market isn’t a thing.

Despite the trade in July, Miami is eligible to sign their former PG because he had a stop over in Toronto.

#bettingadvice
#sportbetting@yungsmoove21 WELCOME TO THE 6️⃣ MAN!!!!! So pumped to have this guy on our @raptors #WeTheNorthFull @Raptors deal appears to be Goran and a 2022 1st rounder for Thad Young, Drew Eubanks and a 2022 2nd rounder. Probably not a big difference between the Raptors 2022 1st rounder and Spurs 2022 2nd rounder.Toronto is moving Goran Dragic, the 35-year-old point guard who hasn’t been with the team in months, to the San Antonio Spurs for 33-year-old Thaddeus Young, a lanky forward who should add some depth to the Raptors roster, according to multiple reports.

https://t.co/7z6Q6JWXJbRaptors gave Spurs a late teens/early 20s pick so they could spend more than the annual average value of that pick's contract to buy out Dragic.

Thad Young is an excellent veteran addition to the team and will mix-and-match well with Toronto's current frontcourt rotation. https://t.co/xrozPaVv34Raptors got a good quality role player in Thaddeus Young, for a player that’s probably gonna get bought out. Good shit Toronto@Sportsnet @Raptors @spurs @ShamsCharania Awful@Sportsnet @Raptors @spurs @ShamsCharania Now we flip Thad + for Porzingas. #Profit@Sportsnet @Raptors @spurs @ShamsCharania Gets them under the tax level that would be very expensive.

Probably unlikely, but like the Cavs, Raptors schedule gets pretty easy.Raptors want Porzingis????? 👀👀👀

Do it, Toronto! #WeTheNorthHearing there is potential for a Dragic/Porzingis swap with Toronto and Dallas. 

Raptors would need to add roughly $7 million to make the deal work but there is mutual interest.Hate to be the bringer of cold water, but my sense from a couple of different sources is the possibility/likelihood of reported Raptors-Knicks-Lakers deal and Toronto ending up with Noel/Talen Horton-Tucker is slim. Some dialogue, for sure, but seriousness? "Mild".veeeery curious to see what a kristaps-to-toronto deal would look like given how close the raptors are to the tax.

is it dragic-boucher-khem? and is dallas getting a pick? or is this a straight salary slashing in advance of free agency for jalen and dfs?Send me Cam asap 🗣 RT @LegionHoops: REPORT: The Knicks, Lakers, and Raptors have discussed a three-team trade that would send Cam Reddish to LA, Dragic to New York, and Talen Horton-Tucker to Toronto.

That would be sweet, Noel is an elite defender and would fit in nice.  Tucker has shown flashes of potential in the past too.

#NBA75 #WeTheNorth #RTZ #NBATwitter@TheMainEvent2k @Raptors Pretty good shot blocker though, and tht would be an alright bench piece. Holmes would def be my first choice though@Kcg_35 @Raptors I'm not sure noel is much of an upgrade. Basically a 3 man battle for minutes every night. I doubt raps give up more then a 2nd rounder or 2. Lakers giving up their 2027 1st for that haul, im guessing. 

It's better then nothing for Goran. I'm ok with it. But nothing special@TheMainEvent2k @Raptors I’d be completely fine with that one as well, we’d be giving up a pick or two but we’ve needed a centre for a couple years now@DownToDunk I was trying to figure out where I'd seen @aleksejpokusevs lay up from tonight's @okcthunder @Raptors  game before. Then it hit me...... https://t.co/nuyssfkFmf@canilive47 @MoeG64467835 @Raptors I say, if you already know something is bad, no point in voicing it. And how does he know that Masai isn’t in the know about the bench? If he can see it I’m sure a trained eye can. You can’t buy a bench of players in a day 🙄@canilive47 @MoeG64467835 @Raptors Okay, so if that’s the first guys stance, why is he upset about their performance? Wasn’t it already established for him that they aren’t great? And it’s just garbage minutes…Now I'm not suggesting the @Raptors #NBAAllStar guard @FredVanVleet is chunky, but the way he's shooting 3s and getting round the court at the moment, can we get the 'Beef Curry' nickname going?A trade with the Knicks and Raptors might happen later on that would send Talen and Nerlens Noel to Toronto; Goran Dragic + Draft picks to New York; and we would get Alec Burks and Cam Reddish.
I like it we get scoring and good defenders and are young so they could stay long termAnyways… 

The Toronto Raptors are a road team tomorrow. ☕️@Kcg_35 @Raptors Not if the current rumors of getting tht and noel are trueI know I'm hours late, but......

They get a 1st and turn Turner $ to expiring. Maybe they need Achiuwa@KarnigeThe @NBAAllStar @Raptors @FredVanVleet Fun fact LaMelo and VanVleet have the same defensive rating, take a look who is with VanVleet on those Deflections, Steals and Recovered Loose Balls.

I get that the East is a crapshoot - Milwaukee is the only thing close to a sure thing, but I don't see the Raps making a deep run just by adding Myles Turner.🏀 NBA betting wrap up (2022.02.10)

#bettingsports #NBA@AKBLJS @Raptors @Bucks @BrooklynNets @MiamiHEAT @sixers @Pacers I like Myles Turner a lot - but he's injured for at least another month and the Raps would only control him until next season.

Not sure the Raps are one player away from title contention [this year for sure]@DeedsWylie @Raptors @Bucks @BrooklynNets @MiamiHEAT @sixers @Pacers Maybe been out the ball game too long but thought Myles that guy@NBA @Raptors Leagues hottest team. Teams taking noticeThe Los Ángeles Lakers are finalizing a deal that send Talen Horton-Tucker to the Toronto Raptors in a exchange with Goran Dragic, source tells ESPN.The Bulls did not get to play Tuesday night against the Detroit Pistons as they don't have enough players. The team's game against the Toronto Raptors on Thursday has also been postponed. https://t.co/ktZmUq12YbKeep Tim Horton-Darcy Tucker FAR away from my Toronto Raptors, thanks. https://t.co/ICgTPIjMHINot sure I like this trade that much for the @Raptors - they take on a LOT of salary for two guys that won't put them over the top vs. @Bucks  @BrooklynNets or even @MiamiHEAT &amp; @sixers 

@Pacers get a LOT of assets + cap space.

But I'm willing to be convinced otherwise. https://t.co/EiriCRi5WkToronto appeared quite active in trade conversations Wednesday night. Various Goran Dragic scenarios. Bigs. Lakers and Raptors have discussed Talen Horton-Tucker, sources said, but any notion that deal is serious has been miscategorized by @TheSteinLine and my listeners.@Eric__Smith Hi Eric, how about them @Raptors! You and Paul should do a top 25 of the greatest Raptors in their history. Who is your pick for Super Bowl 56?If the THT to Toronto rumors are true, Raptors going to turn THT into a real nice player. I wonder what we’d even get from themThe Los Angles Lakers are sending 21 year old Talen Horton-Tucker and 2 future 1st round picks to the Toronto Raptors in exchange for Gary Trent Jr.
