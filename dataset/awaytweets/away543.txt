#NBA #sportsbook #technology #wealth@rraid4life @thehalestone Philly isn’t a large NBA market in the context people discuss it. And even if we say it is, that’s all the more reason a city like Orlando &amp; the Magic would need to. Maybe Philly can talk a FA into joining embiid (who they got from tanking), Orlando never has been able to.Congratulations to jjaayy106 (@JJayPoker) who moved up 1 spot to take #3 on the Orlando Magic team leaderboard.
