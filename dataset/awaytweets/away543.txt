we are heading to OT in Boston https://t.co/9ojwYrNlzzEven if we win going to overtime against the depleted Orlando Magic is embarrassingI love my Orlando Magic announcers but I'm really digging @DanteMagic calling games. I feel like he says what I'm thinking and @JTurnerMagic reels him in with the cooler head. Magic fans are in good hands until @steelemagic gets back.
