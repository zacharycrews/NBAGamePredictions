Where do the Dolphins and Heat play?  Miami-Dade County.   Where do the Panthers play?  Broward County. Where is Sun Sentinel based?  Broward County.@herooine It’s really embarrassing. I believe this is why they left LA the first time and went back to St Louis. Fan base is similar to the Miami Heat@5ReasonsSports Hmmm the national media actually wants the dolphins to be good! They would be heavily covered!! They hate the Miami heat because pat riley lockeroom is not accessible for cameras or they dont give out information.. but honestly who else where they going to take?The Rams fan base are basically a worse version of the Miami heat fan base. Turrible just turrible. How you gonna let SF fans out sell you at your own stadium in the NFC championship LmaooDon’t Trip Ima Bring The Heat Back To Miami this Week I heard Y’all Bitchin All the Way Up here in Michigan Talking Bout It’s Cold down there … lolWatching this game I just have one thought. Bengals are going to win the Super Bowl. They have Miami Heat bubble vibes where they won’t get close to a repeat though@NBulowski @Raptors @MiamiHEAT Congratulations love!! ❤️🥰@BigFrog619 @Bengals Right after the heat and OT of Miami@DanHicken Also the title of the 2012 Miami Heat documentary@MiamiHEAT Cmon kieff@Raptors_12345 @dak25_ @MiamiHEAT I hope the heat play the raptors in the playoffs so we can revisit this

Who will win? 

@MiamiHEAT @celtics 

#LEGENDoftheMiamiHEAT #NBA75The Bengals in the Super Bowl feels very similar to the Miami Heat 2020 NBA Finals run@RodBlackTV @Raptors @MiamiHEAT @Klow7 What a great game Mom and I have calmed down 😅☺️ I was so tense just like coach LoL 😂😂@Raptors_12345 @dak25_ @MiamiHEAT So your stance is that against the raptors, the heat are better without Lowry than with him solely because the raptors are familiar with Lowry?I hate how pervasive American sports are, and how the default assumption is that American male = sports lover.

I just want to turn up the heat on my smart thermostat, but the Google home keeps mishearing me and telling me that Miami Heat is 1st in the eastern conference. 😒@Julio04038937 @MiamiQueen2 @MiamiHEAT You do realize, you are calling Kyle Lowry’s protege a war criminal😂@GreenDarryn Bulls Heat. Mainly cause of Jimmy Buckets but I’m going to University of Miami next year so that’ll play another big part@miamiheatles55 @OGgoat2022 @Juan_MMRdz @Raptors6Man @MiamiHEAT The Mimia heat have done nothing an entire decade and have gotten swept by the bucks after being “stupidly locked in”🤣🤣🤣Bleacher Report labels Marcus Morris Sr. as a surprise deadline target for the Miami Heat 

“Miami might be able to entice them with a package that includes Duncan Robinson and a 2025 first-round pick.” https://t.co/f0m4IIzF86@MiamiHEAT He is trying to rest up for the rematch against the Raptors on Tuesday. 

His feelings got hurt.🏀 Miami Heat (@MiamiHEAT) #HEATCulture

And y’all beat a baby thunder team with no experience. And after lebron left you guys were ass. And our shot isn’t a season saving one. Even if KD played we would still win.Send him to a team that can use him @MiamiHEAT @chicagobulls https://t.co/jwFcSkH5yFSo do @TheSlammySammy @liltheos and of course @JoshOG ...and the Miami Heat stadium for @JoshTheSuff ...@Ygritafuego513 Here in Miami we flood the streets and bang on pots and pans when the Marlins or Heat win anything. We don’t know what happens when the Dolphins win, because they dont do shit. 🤣🤣@MiamiHEAT He played 50 minutes yesterday. If he takes the day off, is not a problem. Miami can still win even without him.@CirnoFumo9 @Arbiter1260 @Project_Ririsu @miami_23_heat Ligma balls. Gotem
