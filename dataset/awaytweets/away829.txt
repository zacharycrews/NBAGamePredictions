Never thought I would feel this way. 🤦‍♂️ @nyknicks@carlymersky I suspect Giants will be good again before the @nyknicks  are competitive again, and that's saying something considering last year's playoff appearance.@Miz85636145 @nyknicks Hope this ratio. I’m not here for watching Cam Reddish get DNPs after we traded a first for him.@TheKnicksWall @nyknicks Now that Grimes may be starting we'll see some ball movementNew York Knicks: Basketball Fans Are Roasting The New York Knicks:  For Their Lack Of A Trade Deadline Move https://t.co/huhAqxsSiZpersonally..im glad to see #JamesHarden GO..NOW MY @nyknicks  CAN TAKE BACK THE CITY..great trade #NBATradeDeadline  thank you #KyrieIrving@nyknicks Apparently the task at hand is to keep doing what hasn't been working. Make sure you play starters to the bitter end, even in blowout losses, and never try anything different. Sounds like a winning recipe.@hhpthebook @KinG_Easy @RAMEL927 @NYPost_Berman @TheKnicksWall @KnicksFanTv @nyknicks @johnnyjohnjon83 @travbryanmusic It wasnt bro trade value is important look at kp you trade him off for a low quality center snd a second round pick 2 years ago kpbwas worth 2 1st round picks@nyknicks That's right@TheoAshNFL as a knicks fan i would like to apologize for not knowing our place, that said we still run new york and nets are poverty@7BOOMERESIASON @GioWFAN no one wanted any @nyknicks players today… but you guys will still focus on and roast the @BrooklynNets 😂Awful day to be a New York Knicks fan. As if there have been any good ones recently.Maybe get KP back on the cheap.
@nyknicks https://t.co/ksMQwK63xdSo @nyknicks and @Lakers actually didn’t make any trades. Damn@NotAGiantsFAN1 @NYLA311 @nyknicks So true.@iHateShaun @nyknicks a break is due for us, if theyre not willing to switch this up, im not willing to switch what i was watching previously for this...shit team. not gonna do it. Like the Knicks, love and value my happiness moreIt’s basically the opposite of the usual claim “can’t rebuild in New York”…nah, Knicks fans are begging for an honest to God, proper rebuild@Shawny_D11 @JaceHanson6 @nyknicks Your franchise will be ass again soon enough.I honestly think the @nyknicks should start Miles McBride@nyknicks You're fucking up!I knew these assholes would do nothin!! @nyknicks https://t.co/IUJWnWwcOJ@jvaron31 @MfersAhead @Mets @nyknicks @NYIslanders @sartoshi_nft Its a really cool collection.

Maybe he’s been working on the mental block preventing him from shooting 3’s during his “mental break” from the Sixers.@connvealmorris @nyknicks It’s only right!@iHateShaun @nyknicks leon rose has to pay for our therapyPer @billoram the proposed @nyknicks/@Lakers/@Raptors deal involving Cam Reddish didn't come together as Toronto/NYK could not agree on draft compensation #Knicks #Lakers@tylerinmovement @JaceHanson6 @nyknicks Can’t relate https://t.co/USxEJbAJHR@ShamsCharania @TheAthletic @Stadium Brunson?????? 🤔 🧐 @nyknicks@nyknicks @MSGNetworks @BetMGM Just don’t get anyone injuredI know I’m late on this pic but really @nyknicks even though this could’ve been taken at any time, the perception Knick fans have of the entire front office after the trade deadline passes and the Knicks don’t do anything to improve a team that obviously needs improvement. https://t.co/oopeIkZ27Z@nyknicks @MSGNetworks @BetMGM yes, can’t wait to get blown out tonight@nyknicks live on. No trades but what that tells me in my opinion is three things. 1. They got outbid on their targets 2. Felt they weren’t getting what they needed out of available trades 3. The hire of Rossas means our front office couldn’t get it together.@Gahsto @BrooklynNets @KyrieIrving @nyknicks YOU ARE THE MINORITY. The rest of them negroes were screaming “KD COMING TO THE KNICKS!!” Nets play in Brooklyn now fam… ain’t no Jersey wack juice left. New owners and new money. CONDOS AND COFFEE!!!@nyknicks Focused on losing and not doing anything to stop the losing?@nyknicks You guys are sleeping  instead  improving  don't  even  play  the youth 
Instead  trying  to win  with  backup  veterans@nyknicks Y’all should’ve shipped Julius Randel to basketball camp. His strength is the inside the Paint. HE’S NOT A SHOOTING GUARD!!! He’s. A power forward…. LAWD!@iHateShaun @nyknicks I guess the move now is to try and unload the contracts after we miss the play-in. Then try and sign Brunson plus our lottery pick@DonLagreca solid analysis!  @RealMichaelKay seems a bit soft on Simmons and harder on @JHarden13 IMO, They are both toxic. Screw the Nets. Laugh all you want at the @nyknicks but the @BrooklynNets will not win a championship in 2022. #thedynastythatneverwas #KnicksNation@bbhkf78 @TheKnicksWall @nyknicks My bet is Cam goes in in the first, his guy scores on him, and he’s benched the rest of the season for it@justhek1 @nyknicks 😂 its a toxic relationship@iHateShaun @nyknicks I'm sure the game tonight against the warriors will make you feel better@RAMEL927 @NYPost_Berman @TheKnicksWall @KnicksFanTv @nyknicks @johnnyjohnjon83 @KinG_Easy @travbryanmusic I don't think other teams wanted our vets. There wasn't a trade to make.Definitely me right now .. @Alex_el_mono @nyknicks #tradedeadline @NBA https://t.co/6RgZZj2M51@iHateShaun @nyknicks When’s the next game at msg? The boos will come roaring downI am afraid of how unhinged I will be. I didn’t want it to come to this. You made me this way, @nyknicks@nyknicks Is anyone really that surprised that the Knicks did squat on free agency day. I would've be surprised if they did anything they did the same thing last year...smh@KCSLAP @BrooklynNets @nyknicks @NBA I guess everyone was sleeping last year when the 76ers got worked by the Hawks in conference semifinals@JaceHanson6 @nyknicks I feel your pain, brother.@wdeister @mo_spade @knicks_tape99 https://t.co/6Qq0gbN6bn

“Following the decision, New York City Mayor Eric Adams announced private businesses can choose whether to require masks.”

So it seems like the Nets would be able to make that decision? Bit unclear, but wouldn’t rule it out@nyknicks @DKSportsbook @los_year  The audacity lmaoSame @nyknicks https://t.co/8qc6DoEpKj@LeerInBK @BrooklynNets @KyrieIrving @nyknicks Fanbase? SMFH...y'all fake ass Nets fams kill me LMFAO...don't know what receipts you talkin bout..I NEVER wanted KD...we'll see tho..when ATL bump y'all LMFAO@Gahsto @BrooklynNets @KyrieIrving @nyknicks Plus YOUR WHOLE FANBASE was yapping about how y’all were gonna get Zion in the draft and KD was coming. How y’all cleared mad cap space and heads want to come play in NYC. Foh!!! I got receipts on YouTube bro. Your fanbase is bonkers and bipolar. Bums!@nyknicks Not watching until RJ is back. FU Thibs@Gahsto @BrooklynNets @KyrieIrving @nyknicks LIIIEEEESSSS!!!!@LeerInBK @BrooklynNets @KyrieIrving @nyknicks WE NEVER wanted KD frail ass!
He ain't it OBVIOUSLY...2 chips courtesy of Steph..Nets are done. We good too...don't have a superstar but a great young core...Randle gon be aight hard to duplicate career season with target on ya back.
Clock tickin' for y'all tho...@nyknicks We could have used that 1st round pick we gave to Atlanta to help in a trade to at least get Jalen Brunson smh 🤦🏽‍♂️ This is ridiculous 😒😒 No PG and no minutes for Cam 🙄🙄@nyknicks For real. Your starting Taj and no hands Noel.  Shit you better focus hard.  Nice job on Halliburton too. Burks &amp; Kemba been killing the point🤣🤣🤣.@NYPost_Berman The @BrooklynNets have made blockbuster trades and bigger free agent signing since they started in  2012 then the @nyknicks ever didThe @nyknicks at the deadline: 

🦗@letstalknicks @nyknicks   we got knicked@Shaerronn The Warriors? Nah. I’m unfortunately a fan of the irredeemable New York Knicks and the underperforming Los Angeles Lakers 😔@nyknicks no move !? 

The whole front office n coaching staff is DRUNKWe’d do very well with this:

C Robinson
PF Sims
SF Reddish
SG Fournier
PG Walker
Coach: Not Thibodeau

@KnicksMSGN @DailyKnicksFS @KnicksNation @nyknicks @RedHourBen@Honor_and_Able @nyknicks I echo this sentimentSeeing all these reports the @nyknicks didn’t make a trade at the deadline

What do you consider the Mavs jettisoning Porzingis?

Big trade victory for the Knicks!@Gahsto @BrooklynNets @KyrieIrving @nyknicks *I get itBill reporting that the rumored Knicks-Lakers-Raptors three-team deal fell through due to disagreement on draft compensation. 

He didn’t specify which side, but New York was the team slated to receive picks in the framework reported by @hoopshype. https://t.co/7L9D3LgRON@Gahsto @BrooklynNets @KyrieIrving @nyknicks Nah bro. Y’all niggas still salty bcuz y’all ain’t get KD, so u get it, lol. Ain’t nobody want Randles bum ass and y’all still in Dolan Land. Don’t worry about us… we good.@Chris7Gallagher @playcampls @nyknicks No. He signed Noel, Burks, Fournier, and even Rose (if we’re being honest), and maxed Julius Randle, none of which is working out well for us.@knickysavs @BrooklynNets @nyknicks @NBA But the defense Nick…the defense.@LegionHoops @IanBegley @nyknicks good shit not trading himEveryone got better but my @nyknicks 🤦‍♂️😡@nyknicks  suck!!! I’m tired of no major player being added and tired of losing Fire everyone get rid of the Owner@KiThatsMe Orange Bo Jackson's New York Knicks innit@TalkingKnicks @SNorma11 @nyknicks Better than making a questionable trade like the Mavs just did….. but I agree that Leon has not shown that he has urgency…Those @nyknicks colors though!!! #KNICKS #nykforever https://t.co/IHNZAQyVEe@nyknicks 💡 💡💡 Sell the Knicks to Charles Barkley@SnellSZN @nyknicks Will serge play tonight?2x NBA champion as Head Coach of the @nyknicks.

I mean did they do fucking anything at all today? Asking for my damn sanity here smh@dennisraimo8 @nyknicks RJ Barrett is the only untouchable imo, I’m also a big Mitch fan, but bro we have so many legitimate trade piecesSo #knicksfans we went from the New York Knicks to Knicknocks? #NYK #knicksfans #hurt #suffering #knickknocks@nyknicks Y’all got some explaining to do…@Dattfranco @alanhahn @nyknicks Esp when we see what's happening with Reddish. But it helps our long term outlook, as long as the assets we collect are on reasonable contracts. That backfired because no one wants Noel or Burks right now, but the plan hasn't changed: get good players and things will work out.Cmon @nyknicks@nyknicks Absolute failure by the FO before the trade deadline. Every single sports talk show &amp; outlet are going to consider the Knicks losers for not making any moves to improve their roster. Several upgrades went for virtually nothing in trades. They better have huge off-season plans.Damn so the @nyknicks made no moves smh it’s cool we just waiting to overpay a washed up player in the off-season@TheKnicksWall @nyknicks Well they can stop showcasing guys now. Nobody wants them@Dattfranco @alanhahn @nyknicks Thats all fair. You're not wrong, but context is important. We drafted Deuce before Kemba was bought out - that was seen as lucky at the time. Sims was drafted as Mitch &amp; Noel insurance. The plan is to gain as many assets as possible, which isn't great for youth development, 1/2@Grusso2005 @nyknicks Sadly, I don't think selling the team is going to make much of a difference.I don’t like how the @nyknicks are doing my DukeBoy @camreddish get him some fckin play minutes fit him in the rotation don’t be one of them that’s a$$ kissin later on because yall noticed his greatness just get him some play time now and you won’t have to be ass kissers later 🤣@nyknicks Scott perry days are numbered nice guy but hasn't done enough to keep his job.@londonstheory @nyknicks Think we see it by the end of the all star break@playcampls @nyknicks 🧢 he coulda made a trade just to make a trade and that shit never works out.

The Knicks organization is the lions of football.  Both of them need to sell and move on. Knicks basketball should be more.  Honestly I’m so sick of being a Knicks fan.  90’s highlights that’s it for me@nyknicks Today is the day I cancel my NBA league pass.

Signed players nobody wants including the coach..
Re-signed players that play worse than the youth that’s backing them up..

You guys had a ring like 2 years ago. Let’s not compare our sports pain 😂😂@yazsports @Andrew_Costley @BovadaOfficial Slight revisionist history, Carmelo didn’t force the @nyknicks to do anything. The #Knicks dysfunctional front office did that on their own. With Mello the Knicks did manage a 51 win season, which they wouldn’t have done without him. He deserved better management from the Knicks.I guess it could been worse and we traded for Westbrook, just wish we could have moved veterans for young guys to get some more time @nyknicks https://t.co/xiIP8VQ9bB@nyknicks @nyknicks management is a bunch of jerks!!!! They must take pleasure in losing!!!@jbona2333 Lol I just meant playing in nyc he’ll have to deal with the ny media.

But let’s see if we could turn it around and sneak in.How the damn @nyknicks made me feel today and every day. Throw the whole team and organization away.

Grimes should be the first off the bench when Fournier is cold.  Rose/Grimes backcourt is the best backcourt the @nyknicks can roll out.

Thibs must recognize Quickly isn't a PG &amp; properly utilize himMy mood after today’s NBA trade deadline passed… 😐😒 #nba #houstonrockets #newyorkknicks https://t.co/AnjVVCrFDp@nyknicks Leon Rose = Brody Van Wagenen

They should have learned from the Mets. Front office needs yet another overhaul, sadly.No true @nyknicks fan should be surprised or even upset that they made zero trades at the deadline

Team dangled Randle in trades talks but couldn't get a good enough return. Obi will never get much playing time because of Randle. Knicks tried to unload Founier but no one wanted him.@JiggyRiz @nyknicks @Dame_Lillard We keep striking out indeed it’s frustrating 🤦🏾‍♂️@nyknicks #knicks need to have a serious conversation with Thibodeau. It make no sense to be in the lottery again this year if Thibs doesn’t like to play his young players.. Knicks PG of the future is Locked away at the end of the bench . Miles McBride. The future is NOW !!@SuYork_1023 @nyknicks Lol after awhile I just can’t help but laughI am pretty certain, deep down KP wishes he played things out differently in New York—-KP is Knicks version of Mets Matt Harvey. The Unicorn and the Dark Knight are no longer@M240Victor @nyknicks I hope they don't fire Thibs so your kids can starve and die, so your line will be removed from the gene poolSo… @nyknicks we did nothing 🤔@Dattfranco @alanhahn @nyknicks This is only their 2nd year. We gotta remember where we were a few years ago. Nobody thought we would be a consistent playoff team in 2 years. We gotta stop punishing this FO for overachieving last year. This was always going to take time. I'm still encouraged with where we are.@nyknicks It's is clear as day that no reporters or YouTubers or Twitter know what the full they are talking about when it come to trade rumors. I am unsubscribing and unfollowong all of you. Total waste of my time@michellermreid 30 more games of Randle Burks and Noel 🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️or more like 3 games of Noel...🙄 😂 Screw the @nyknicksIs you sears?

No one would have cared if he wasn’t playing for the Knicks, I remember it clearly. Everyone knew it was not sustainable except the New York media and ESPN favoring NYC storylinesBeen a @nyknicks fan since I was a little kid in the 90s, but days like today reinforce just how extraordinarily atrocious their revolving door of a front office has been since Dolan took over &amp; Checketts traded Patrick Ewing to Seattle. Yet again, the Knicks are unwatchable.Alright @nyknicks waive Kemba, Burks, and Noel. These ppl are worthless@nyknicks Like*@nyknicks Thanks for nothing!! https://t.co/xWlO2hj1EG@sal_licata I’ve been a fan since Ewing was drafted and have not missed a single game. BUT…though I don’t hate the @nyknicks, I certainly don’t love Thibs (never been a fan, even pre-Knicks) or Leon Rose. Today reinforces that the Phil Jackson style of front office incompetence is back.@nyknicks Please delete@cjthesmartguy Now who do the @nyknicks need! Those my peeps imma OG@nyknicks What is that?

Worst organization in all sports.@nyknicks *tank at handA pathetic deadline from the #Knicks. I'm just apathetic now.There is zero pleasure to watch them. No direction here, broken promises made.

So there it is, nobody won the KP trade between New York &amp; Dallas. The trade didn’t mean shit for either team 🤣Worst part about #NewYorkForever #Knicks not making any trade prior to #NBATradeDeadline is they probably think that’s ‘all good!’
Paid consultant to advise on trades and did nothing!

Exploring the other side of the roster and the buyout market just might be as good (along with a D.Rose return).@nyknicks @DKSportsbook This franchise wants us to watch this team? Knick fans, stop buying anything Knick related. They think one playoff appearance was enough for us to forget how they're the most dysfunctional team in sports.@WardyNYM @nyknicks I really would like to know why we are so damn dysfunctional? A supposedly All-Star front office. Seriously, I didn’t know that MSG and it’s brain trust were located in fucking CLOWNVILLE. 🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡 #nyknicks get a damn clue. James Dolan, leave the Knicks alone. 🤬@nyknicks since no moves were made and Thibs keeps saying he likes our guys. How about we play the young guys more often? Just a thought.@Delblogo Id never talk to this toxic fan base and trash new york media once if i worked for the Knicks. Maybe when the media covers the Knicks fairly they will talk.You guys are a joke @nyknicksSo the @nyknicks and @Lakers didn’t do much are they both so confident that they will be out of the play in games come playoff time ?Despite being last in the East, currently the 12th seed, and 7 under 500, for some reason Thibs and Leon Rose did not improve the @nyknicks roster. Meanwhile, once Rose &amp; RJ return, Grimes &amp; Cam will ride the pine, and Obi will average 10-12 mins. per. Inexplicable logic.@ryanmc817 @nyknicks You’ll get Burks and Fournier shoved in your face and you’ll like it!Jamal Crawford on Knicks:

And they can withstand losing a player or 2 to injury 🤕 and still win games.

And some of those players haven't even scratched the surface.  They will get better.

The Knick’s will give up a #1 LA needs.@nyknicks y’all need to get rid of Kemba, Fournier, Burks, and Randle. Thibs is garbage too so he can go.

All this just to trade him again?? Piss poor franchisegood morning New York Knicks fans

talk soon 👀According to @MikeAScotto, one potential hangup in the #Lakers, #Knicks, and #Raptors trade talks centers on the draft pick compensation going to New York. Los Angeles discussed sending them a 2nd round pick but New York sought more as talks continued.@nyknicks hurry up already@nyknicks DO NOT TRADE @camreddish PLESSE FOR GOD SAKESDear @nyknicks, if you get Dragic, can you please buy him out so he can come home to Miami?

I dedicate this Wordle to the 2021-22 New York Knicks. Aggressively mediocre and disappointing.I hope someone saves him from being wasted by the New York Knicks. Why would you trade for a player that your coach doesn’t really want?? Clearly the player isn’t going to get much burn if the coach isn’t on board!!! https://t.co/T5HG3W4GqR@nyknicks @MSGNetworks @BetMGM Cal the special victims unit@KnicksVerse @nyknicks Begley says this was discussed but has stalled.This whole Cam Reddish thing is insane. 

Knicks won’t play him for some god awful reason. 

Lakers are in pursuit as the team crumbles. 

And this 3 way deal just doesn’t make sense.. 

@nyknicks WAKE UP.Fukkit, go get Westbrook @nyknicks@HolesMad @nyknicks Annoyingly, there are workarounds. Cam can be traded for a single player and a separate deal can be made to even out the compensation.@StateNYKPOD @LukeHen73716015 @Not47Buddz @0oty_Mac @LegionOfKnicks @Knickanators @IanChisolm @Knickstape2005 @victorlb03 @Knickloyalty @_knicks1688 @queens_dude @Sharonchik266 @kunal____ @travbryanmusic @SellDaTeamDolan @RaphaelDiaz @eepdllc @PreZnyc621 @Woodshed_1914 @Vazquez1Gil @TruePG718 @YankeesKnicks99 @RTaylor2283 @excelsheetking @Jaelin_Taylor @BadBadLeroyBro7 @rahmmagick @Chuck1one @AJTheManChild @ShannonTFortune @eski225 @KnicksBig15 @TMal761 @J1gg__ @MikeFromQns7 @stalling_e @JeDiGoLLuM01 @DonaldP47082631 @Markjoh91017488 @EdMemphisPimpin @acedghill @Freekeith @Trace_AVP @The0akster @mikenieve @NoahBagnardi @SoulbroPodcast @RudeBoyNYK @nyknicks Why not just poor the bleach in the orifice left by your ripped off sick? https://t.co/nJY6Nqkm28if the @nyknicks do anything but get a PG by later today, i’ll be thoroughly disgusted. if they do absolutely nothing at all I’ll also be thoroughly disgusted having to watch this lineup.I had a very wild dream last night.

Immanuel Quickley captured the hearts of Knicks fans as a rookie. 

In just one season, he seems to have lost them. He has to get his confidence back to help New York turn its season around.

@p_diazNY ✍🏽 

https://t.co/l6nnV8c0lv@MrChuckD @nyknicks Julius Randle a disgruntled “star” who isn’t as good as the front office thought. Pair him with a guy who is over the hill and seemingly disgruntled in LA. What could go wrong? That’s def thinking about the future@NYK_MattOC @nyknicks 5hrs left (i think)Today’s the day @nyknicks!!!! https://t.co/osFAFoV9qm@BrandonTierney Good morning Brandon. The new York knicks don't have right combo in the roster. The coach doesn't know what he is doing with this team. I am a Brooklyn nets and a mets fan and jets fan honestly these teams need to find the right pieces make a trade you wantI HATE YALLLLLLLLLLLLL @NYKNICKS@nyknicks Knicks management is dumb! Let’s strengthen other teams and make our team worse.  Dragic is bout to retire he is finished and we trade two decent players for him. I’m officially done even thinking about this crap team@nyknicks Fire THIBS!!!please make a trade, but not a dumb one @nyknicks@nyknicks does Dragic even play in the league anymore? He hasn’t played for the Heat in sometime now. Knicks bout to make another dumb move.  Rose is not the answer at manager.  Thibs is not the answer at coach and we have a bunch of players we can’t even trade they are so badAt this point I’m begging @nyknicks PLEASE GET DE’AARON@NY_KnicksPR @nyknicks SOMEONE GET LEON ROSE AND THIBS DRUG TESTEDNew York Knicks: Knicks Morning News (2022.02.10) https://t.co/1akwa0r836@GordonL26059956 Yes it would be terrible for my New York Knicks. Ben Simmons is, according to my algorithms, the 201st best player in the NBA. His rare mix of horrendous offense with good defense enables him to be a good 6th man option@nyknicks I can’t believe the Knicks are trading Alec Burks for an aging player in Dragic. I swear the Knicks organization is probably the dumbest in the league.  They are definitely the laughing stock for so many yearsLets go get Brunson @nyknicks@nyknicks make moves https://t.co/hZd6n99B07@nyknicks Leon better already be on the damn phones@nyknicks are u kidding me? Knicks getting rid of a young up coming star for a 35 year old who is at the end of his career. Can they ever get it right.  Randle ? Fournier? Need to go@nyknicks do something today thxWassup @nyknicks what we doing??!!!!@nyknicks it’s very simple try your best to dump kemba, Burks, Noel, Julius… no dumb shit@nyknicks Leon wake TF up!@hhpthebook @nyknicks Its because when we have good players, NY fans ride them out of town because they are not superstars like Randle. NY doesn't appreciate its players/coaches/GM etc because they expect everyone to be a superstar and can't be happy with them just being good players.He's 15 now 🥰😭 @nyknicks  fans 4 life 🧡💙 https://t.co/PSpw7bqcPz@FBDards @Lakers @JohnWall @nyknicks @russwest44 @HoustonRockets Randle and Wood on the same team? Don’t see how that would ever workTic tac tic tac @nyknicksThe New York Knicks play basketball today. Rejoice (nap and/or drink) accordingly 😅@NBA_NewYork Leon Rose has displayed nothing above being marginally better than Steve Mills. You trade for Cam ,  not to play him because you have a coach who coaches likes it’s 2008? Team is still Dolan led train wreck and will be until he sells. I’m done w KnicksAre you listening @nyknicks ? https://t.co/IKQnGEqv9v@nyknicks how long until you guys fire Thibodeau and trade away all his ex Bull players ? Or are we just going to watch RJ get pumped out by Thibodeau the same way he did Rose in Chicago ?@nyknicks Goran Dragic won’t solve any of our fucking long term problems, stop settling for MID ASS PLAYERS and make a damn moveNeed Burks Noel Kemba Fournier Gone by 3pm EST. @nyknicks 

@KnicksOnClutch @JoeyBJungle@washakated @nyknicks Does seem that way. Doesnt it@Mark_Wessol @nyknicks Beat writers said yesterday he was doubtful. It wasn’t a serious injury@BreezeRiches Your man russ is horrible. I’ve been saying it for years. Those tripple doubles were a front just like James harden play. Once James harden stop getting those calls he start shooting 5-25. No one wants to touch russ not even my New York Knicks and that’s saying something📬🏀KFS Newsletter Alert🏀📬

Trade Deadline Primer! I went through all 29 teams from the Knicks’ perspective, seeing who’s of interest, why New York might want to do a deal, and what it would take to get their targets.
https://t.co/htFVt4uRFR@ClutchPointsApp @NBAMemes In all honesty the @nyknicks have nothing to lose bc this season is a wash. But I really don’t see ANY team bailing out the @Lakers #NBATradeDeadline@TAPEDByKnicks @nyknicks Just weird they haven’t really announced anything other than he is out for tonightToday is the day. The fans are in agreement we want Burks Kemba &amp;Noel gone or on the bench. Please don’t trade Cam Reddish.. #NewYorkForever @nyknicks@Mark_Wessol @nyknicks He’s fine.

It’s like the Knicks last year. New York went nuts. Now look at them this year. Had expectations and shit the bed. Imagine if we do the same. You’ll wish we had Lebron then @KenCarman @SportsBoyTony@nyknicks trade for Westbrook, and deandre. Keep Fournier, he’s done too much for the team #tradedeadlineI don’t believe in “reports say.” All I’ll say is, if true, Leon Rose, World Wide Wes, Scott Perry, &amp; the rest of them can eat a bus. They would literally be turning the @nyknicks into a clown show if they did this. This deal is solely to helps LBJ.

But thanks for playingA trade with the Knicks and Raptors might happen later on that would send Talen and Nerlens Noel to Toronto; Goran Dragic + Draft picks to New York; and we would get Alec Burks and Cam Reddish.
I like it we get scoring and good defenders and are young so they could stay long termImo Brodie would fit perfectly into @nyknicks right now as is . Maybe not 2 months ago but the team looks like iso offense on the fly most of the time. No offense scheme. Westbrook would at least keep attacking the rim with a still decent handle.

There’s a reason Steve Mills will never have another NBA job ! Anything attached to Dolan has a stench . Rose has been awful https://t.co/vTUjEcEu0B.@nyknicks Obi the real deal need more pt@hhpthebook @nyknicks No one recently moves the needle. The hype behind NYC PGs is just that.@hhpthebook @nyknicks Those dudes wouldn’t even make a Euro teamCheck out Nike New York Knicks Youth Large Dri-Fit Tee New w/Tags Original Price $30 Gray https://t.co/Y16vhYKm2Q @eBay@greenparksports @nyknicks Greenies for the win!!!@nbaraw @nyknicks I said he was thin-skinned. But, here are the facts. He paid Isiah Thomas to turn the Knicks around, he failed. He paid a former Knick player and 9 time championship coach Phil Jackson and he to failed. He has no problem spending his money. But they all failed the guy.@NY_KnicksPR @nyknicks https://t.co/vTUjEcEu0B.    Thibs was fired in last two gigs for a plethora of reasons -one being OVERPLAYING PLAYERS. Now RJ? Team is an embarrassment. Leon has airballed. He’s Steve Mills w slightly better drafting@vbagame @Lakers @nyknicks Ben ain't going nowhere. No wants him IMO.
Lakers don't know but I'd dump Brodie and Melo.
Knicks need to build around Randle and RJ, drop Noels.@2FLY_NYC @nyknicks Indeed@Jukebox3331 @nyknicks Main reason i tweeted that is I dont want THT lol. No way we get a first for burks but tht makes me sick. Who would we end up trading tht for lol.@hhpthebook @nyknicks Let’s talk FACTS.Taking out last year, Dolan’s Knicks has worst record in NBA since 1999. Dolan also voted in ESPN one of worst owners in NBA. Issues with fans, former players , Spike etc . Starts at top . New ownership 🙏🏾@nyknicks please don’t do nothing stupid tmr@IamSalmz @carmeloanthony @nyknicks Knicks ain't making the playoffs@knicks_stk He's sure as fuk wasting the @nyknicks year.....@massey_evan DO IT @nyknicks@playoffpbball @nyknicks Hear me out. We trade this for these, we keep the 1st and trade tht in a bigger deal https://t.co/Tlgpuh8zr1Do it @nyknicks https://t.co/NI8g7JElmDJUST DON’T MAKE A TRADE WITH THE LAKERS PLEASE @nyknicks 😂 https://t.co/CqdVLKPQwi@hhpthebook @nyknicks Rafer Alston was an alma mater at my high school. He used to come and throw events and even at an older age he was the best baller I ever seen live 😭😭😭😭@nbaraw @nyknicks I definitely don't blame Dolan. That man is thin-skinned but, he's hired people and paid them to find players and they didn't get it done. The Rangers won a Title with Dolan as the owner. I would work for Dolan in a heartbeat.@Kazeem @BillPidto @MSGNetworks @nyknicks Dolan , Leon Rose, Thibs an awful big three . Rose is the architect of this train wreck yet had been on mute . Thibs , fired from last two gigs from overplaying his players . Now RJ hurt due to Thibs. Steve Mills is laughing somewhere . AwfulWe’re such a poverty franchise @nyknicks https://t.co/2TXHNx7sHkCheck out NBA Youth Large 14/16 New York Knicks Knit Thermal New w/Tags Original Price $34 https://t.co/PleqUayco4 @eBay@nyknicks Trade him to the Lakers rn! https://t.co/cFZ2CKeQG7@Knicks_SNOB ppllzz someone.. make it make sense 🤨 I promise u if @nyknicks make this trade and Randle still on the roster I’m done watching NY basketball for the season..I am submitting a formal bid to purchase the New York Knicks@hhpthebook @nyknicks Unfortunately fam, it starts with ownership. Although Dolans been quiet , Leon Rose his man has been awful. Outside of a pandemic outlier, he airballed $55 M in FA and has not spoken to media . Anything related to Dolan is bad .@hhpthebook @nyknicks We might need to get Ed “Booga” Smith@VilleSZN @Cjblamen @nyknicks Fuck that send my Dawg to LA they can have whoever they want Stay Melo included!! ( #3 &amp; #11 off limits though)@Cjblamen @nyknicks They let Tibbs hold him hostage for no reason smh@nyknicks what’s up with Michell Robinson 👀👀👀 https://t.co/vIqY5jfamq@knicks100aGM @nyknicks You're kidding right?How can NYC produce such great streetball legends, but the @nyknicks can't find one.  I would scout for free, and I bet you I could find us a freaking PG. In the entire world of Basketball, you're telling me, you can't find one stinking PG. I'm so angry with the team I love! https://t.co/M7DEVimGLI@nyknicks yall better not trade Kemba... He's a New York native teach Tim, how to coach don't touch this bronx native... Don't Obi either ya'll bugging@memphisbleek "Orange Bo Jackson's, New York Knicks it"...@JoshEberley Stephen A is so upset with the New York teams ( Nets &amp; Knicks) that he's really in his feelings these days. If the knicks had the bulls roaster, you couldn't tell him nothing!!!Why do you guys hold your Wings hostage ? @nyknicks you guys should’ve been let Knox go. https://t.co/RepKtzLyck@nyknicks if you trade for Russell, I will no longer be a Knicks fan!!  I rather lose the rest of the remaining games than have that cancer of a player on our team! #DONTDOIT #KNICKS@hhpthebook @nyknicks But that formula didn’t work so well in the 80s every team goes through a bad stretch@nyknicks, wake the hell up already. Thibs must go. https://t.co/GX5ivY9CjZIf the NEW YORK KNICKS trade RJ FUCKING BARRETT tomorrow I will buy not one, not two, but all fucking THREE jerseys from the Nets big three 

Authentic too https://t.co/75KrIDREAJ@DYoffee @nyknicks Rod Strickland,  Micheal Ray Richardson &amp; Ray Wiilams were interchangeable. Mark Jackson.  I think New York did a poor job of prioritizing that position. I don't that will be the case going forward.@hhpthebook @nyknicks How come the Knicks are the only team in the NBA that has had issues finding a very good point guard? The last great Point Guard that the Knicks had for a long period of time was Walt Clyde Frazier,although they did have Mark Jackson for a little while@nyknicks @ATLHawks @OrlandoMagic @spurs y’all watching Talen Horton Tucker today?? Real hooperI'm a Mets fan, but thank God for George Steinbrenner. At least he knew what the NY sports fan wanted and he delivered. Home runs, great teams and championships.  @nyknicks I'm so tired of chanting Defense, give us some offense and championships Enough already! https://t.co/dQwRvRaKaC@LakersNation @nyknicks randle for Russ my mans over here would change y’all team 😤@nyknicks let me get RJ and Cam for 2 2nd rounders https://t.co/gFgK1FlkFk@JasDoooIt @JaredCotter @nyknicks Jump to 2:18 of the clip@nyknicks Start fighting@MPleasing72 I’m told the Sixers are targeting Guard Kemba Walker and Swingman Alec Burks from the New York Knicks.It’s the day before the trade deadline. I need to see something @nyknicks 🤷🏽‍♂️@StateNYKPOD @nyknicks Listen man , the Knicks will  never get young talent again if they fuck this up@nyknicks Well, after reading that Kemba may be only guy they move, that Would be a let down. I can’t see who would want him. Randle has to go. They cannot build a contender around him!@NBATradeReport The team that doesn’t have a point guard and that needs one.. declined. @nyknicks  Now that’s what’s up! 🤣We'll never get tired of watching @StephenCurry30 serve up one-handed dimes. 🤩
