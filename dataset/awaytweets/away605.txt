Klay is obviously more valuable and wtf do you mean that could change? He is taking half of Wiggins shots away off rip. Draymond without question is more valuable which puts him at 4th.

Golden State Warriors vs Memphis Grizzlies O221 (-110)There is a chance I may bet Golden State/Memphis - TBD. Want to see what the starting lineups are and get a more firm analysis from that, but am currently leaning slightly towards pass.
