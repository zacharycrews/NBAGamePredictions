Miami Heat - Chicago Bulls

Bam Adebayo O10.5 Rebounds @ 2.15 ($100)

Bulls are awful at rebounding at the moment, and Adebayo should feast. He cleared this number in 7 out of the L10 matches.

Missing Lonzo and Caruso has been really tough, but a lineup that has DeRozan, LaVine, and Vooch should be able to beat a great team at least every now and then. I don't like just assuming they'll lose every time they play someone legit, like the Heat later today.@Crypto_Nolt ze Chicago BULLS take over@chicagobulls @NBCSChicago @670TheScore please beat a good teamHappy birthday to Alex Caruso aka the CARUSHOW aka the champ aka the greatest bald player in Chicago Bulls history https://t.co/aPYvFeOHEd@MCWRules @NBA @ACFresh21 @chicagobulls He owns him?

The chemistry would already be there. If Lakers built this team, they could easily be a #4 or #5 seed in the West. This team would be similar to the current Chicago Bulls.@GreenDarryn Niggas saying Chicago bulls like this 2k or some@Sedano @chicagobulls What percentage chance would you give them to make it to the finals?

All I'm saying is, the current uniforms ran it's course by a wide margin. I'm just wondering why it's not being upgraded. It's like an old used up rotting car lot. #when🤔@keezygoated What about Chicago bulls@ThankYouTaceGod @dgs_dubbnasty12 @GreenDarryn Jordan‘s final year with the Chicago Bulls he did not sacrifice his defense so he would have more energy on offense. He was a monster at both ends of the court at 34 years old. When is the last time LeBron even thought about playing defense?The got me at the score table at the @lakers game chopping it up with my old head from the 215 the legend Tom Washington about the call he missed in the 93 @chicagobulls finals lol @ https://t.co/HOilthVlzD Arena https://t.co/lCW24TnZ7AMichael Jordan, nick name Air Jordan was a professional basketball player considered to be the greatest all-around player in the history of the game.
