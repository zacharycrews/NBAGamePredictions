Phoenix is on a B2B with both Booker and Ayton questionable. Portland should have Lillard back but McCollum is out. I see this as a virtual tossup that should go under.

Bet slip link: https://t.co/OUDnVqTU1h https://t.co/OdN9eh6Q2r(I still think it’s so funny that Mira uses Phoenix Hua for Amaterasu and it is so accidentally fitting because Sun gods are technically derived from Athra inherently so they could basically look identical. They’re like Athra’s watered down spawn.)@Suns @BannerHealth If clippers win this one it don’t countWhat time the @Suns playing?@luv3bk @incontinent55 Beautiful photo!
