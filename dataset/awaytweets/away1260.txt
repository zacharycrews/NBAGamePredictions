They could put a stranglehold on this series, with a chance to close out in Dallas for Game 5. https://t.co/8W5F7UCLgH@dallasmavs are playing this afternoon.

@NBA@dallasmavs Ok I need to eat crow here and apologize to Jason Kidd and Jalen Brunsen. I thought Kidd was the wrong choice for Coach and I thought Jalen should have been traded not KP. I was wrong on both counts.Keep it up. @ESPNNBA @SiriusXMNBA @TermineRadio @NBAonTNT@frjoshTX @rpritchie @dallasmavs I’ve got old school Directv so I overpay and see it all I just did not think it would be blacked out for others on NBA TV@UTAHJOES 🤣 Are you going to get to watch the @dallasmavs play Saturday? 😜Jalen Brunson @dallasmavs remember this tweet!!!@NBA @dallasmavs @SDinwiddie_25 We better keep him after this season.
