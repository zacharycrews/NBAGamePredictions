Just kidding...Hope we keep both next year.  Love this team!@sabalabading @MiIlsWrld @cavs @firstenergycorp He's a top 5 pick because Koby took a chance on him, lmao the growing pains are here forsure but imagine how scary this kid can be when his offensive game comes around lmao it took Jimmy Butler 4 years to develop an offensive game@cavs @CollinSexton02 @CarisLeVert RE-SIGN SEXTON@BrianPDA21 @cavs @CollinSexton02 @CarisLeVert Trade deez nuts@BrianPDA21 @cavs @CollinSexton02 @CarisLeVert Past the trade deadline@cavs @CollinSexton02 @CarisLeVert Is their possibility he’s back before end of season?@cavs @CollinSexton02 @CarisLeVert Trade him@habibi_woo @swipakenta @MiIlsWrld @cavs @firstenergycorp You're assuming he'll grow into it despite showing zero signs of improvement in a year and a half.

Has it prevented the Cavs from winning or performing at a high level? I think the fuck not lmfao@swipakenta @MiIlsWrld @cavs @firstenergycorp I think I already explained it bozo.

Lol he's raw offensively what are u not understanding it's gonna take time for him to develop on offense I'm not giving up on him@Cavs2Icy @MiIlsWrld @cavs @firstenergycorp He takes 7 shots a game. He doesn't need to take shots from anyone. He should be scoring more than 8.9 a night on 7 shots, especially considering he's a slasher@cavs @ribeiroo_juu @firstenergycorp let's bora https://t.co/bDkTbxfEnx@KhalidCavsStan @YoungBullCLE @cavs @_bigjayy_ That's great 😂 and I understand why he couldn't pause it lol@sabalabading @MiIlsWrld @cavs @firstenergycorp Sure, if we want him taking away shots from better offensive players maybe@swipakenta @MiIlsWrld @cavs @firstenergycorp He's 21. At least get the age right if you're trying to make a point. And after a season and a half, he's shown virtually zero improvement on offense.@SeanGetPaid2xx @CincyMag_ @cavs @BuffaloBills you're the best@nbatopshot @NBA Good luck #LetEmKnow

DG v JA, Mobley v JJJ. https://t.co/DRVE8Y8OdK@TA4Trey @cavs @firstenergycorp Good defender against bottom 8 teams. Was horrific against the sixers.@MiIlsWrld @cavs @firstenergycorp A top-5 overall pick should be able to score double digits a game regardless of him being an all-world defender@sabalabading @cavs @firstenergycorp You’re saying dropping 7 he’s here to play defense mostly and he does a good job at that@MiIlsWrld @cavs @firstenergycorp Good job assuming you have any idea my thoughts on his defense bud@cavs @firstenergycorp this team starts awful offensively until osman and love checks in every single night in the last few weeks
time to change@sabalabading @cavs @firstenergycorp And play good defense and you’ll still cryAssuming they can keep their cores together, don't think there is a team better primed for the next 10 years than the #Cavs and #Grizzlies.
Both are extremely young squads with a wealth of talent. It's an exciting time to be a @cavs fan.@cavs @firstenergycorp Can't wait for Okoro to drop 7 tonight!@Charmader6 @cavs @firstenergycorp you mean 50,20 and 10?@MidfieldQB3 @cavs @firstenergycorp Dean Wade is good?
