Tailing both parlays too. https://t.co/NbuKJQOwzKThe Brooklyn Nets decorated their arena with Chinese characteristics for recent games because of the Chinese New Year. Brooklyn Nets are owned by Joe Tsai. He was born in China.

They have a top tier goalie, top tier defenseman, 1C, and an all world offensive winger.
