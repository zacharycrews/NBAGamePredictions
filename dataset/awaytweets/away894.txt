Duncan Robinson (702 3pt FG made) has only attempted 1727 3s in his 4 years as a member of the Miami Heat.

Glen Rice, who is the all-time leader for 3pt FG made (806), attempted 2263 3s in his 6 years as a member of the Miami Heat.Key stats for the remainder of the season:

Duncan Robinson is 11 3s away from having the second most 3pt FG made in Miami Heat history behind Glen Rice.

#MiamiHeat 🏀🔥My take on lebrons Miami Heat teams.. D-Wade only 1 good healthy Season together , that was the 1st year together. Ray Allen was basically Kyle Kover people act like he was Jesus Shuttlesworth in Miami he was just a jump shooter. Bosh was a good stretch 4 when healthy.I just uploaded “Miami Heat vs New York Knicks Prediction 2-25-22 - Free NBA Picks” to #Vimeo: https://t.co/xI6GL7pWlmSay what you like about Step Up but honestly the opening sequence to Miami Heat has got to be one of the greatest group choreography sets in a movie.

The damn starting point guard averaged 3 points and 1 assist. Dwade was playing with 1 knee 15 pts. Bosh healthy 14 &amp; 5. He averaged 2 other superstar points together that’s sad. How do this fall on him??@MrChuckD @MiamiHEAT @dallasmavs Zo was my dude when I started getting into basketball in middle school.Holy crap. I’m an idiot.

Let’s go on a 23 game streak !!!!@ben_alterman @evansaacks @TyNOLA5 @McQuaddie Exactly. All the Heat fans 45 and younger know is Pat Riley in Miami and the Dolphins being terrible post-Marino. 

Miami (college football) is still undoubtedly bigger than either pro team anyway. And they still have horrendous attendance.The brand is Dwyane Wade not the Miami heat so what the fuck are we doing here exactly https://t.co/ibziUeJMOb@jay4774 @Jeremiah_Film @prncejames @MiamiHEAT Gabe is an outstanding defender and has those games were he’s sniping them from 3My blood boils thinking about the Miami Heat game coming up, I think Bulls are eons better, can we win these next 2 vs them pleaseYOU DO NOT KNOW BASKETBALL IF YOU CONSIDER THE @cavs WITH @KingJames , @KyrieIrving &amp; @kevinlove a SUPER TEAM!

A win tomorrow vs the #Knicks will put Miami back at 1st seed. 

#HEATCulture@KelCol3 @JoeJ_757 @optimisticskol @DwyaneWade Okay mjs the goat we get it what did any of this have to do with Lebron being the greatest MIAMI HEAT player of all time cause I’m pretty sure that’s where this started@MiamiHEAT Dipo &amp; Morris 🔜🔥@JoshEberley Didn’t 2011 Dirk, at 32 years old, go on some playoff run going 12-3 against teams led by Kobe/gasol/bynum, Russ/KD/ibaka, and Miami heat Lebron/Wade/bosh without any all star teammates in his only chance to get a ring? 🙂@MiamiHEAT we gotta be ready for a dog fight!@flea333 Trade him to the Miami heat for duncan and morris. Lebron is clearly the reason why the lakers are doing poorly this season and he’s also ruining russ’s game.@YungBansMan @statmuse the game had nothing to do with Bam or the Miami Heat and you still wanna hate 😂@ThisisFabrice @afifaminxx @Jalin_Johnson35 @rangeanywhere @mattcomnick @SkipBaylessShow @RealSkipBayless The one where he has the most all defensive teams of all time and the one where he won more rings in a different decade then dirk has rings total? And before you say "B-B-But he had better teammates1!1!1" he had 25pts in the first half against prime LeBron and the Miami heatThe @chicagobulls are the undisputed #1 team in the east, suck it @MiamiHEAT@Cryptoniteezy @TheHoopCentral Ok. But have they beat the Miami heat?@statmuse Only East team with a winning record vs .500 teams? Miami Heat literally 19-14 vs teams over .500"Miami needs to relocate because no fans go to their games 🤣🤣🤣

Also Jimmy Butler worst all star of all time

And finally, Ish Smith &gt;&gt;&gt; Tyler Bubble Boy Herro 🤣🤣🤣"

The mind of a Heat hater who won't admit they hate the Heat which is 95% of NBA Twitter https://t.co/BkT4PK7CKTi'm seeing miami heat vs chicago bulls on monday and apparently that's really good i wouldn't know23 games left💪🏽 #miamiheat https://t.co/EkNY2AYlQqDid Charles Barkley say the Chicago Bulls was first in the East?

You were in Miami for Bitcoin 2021, that wasn't terrible.  

It's year-to-year.  

Candidly, the heat island effect in Manhattan makes summer worse there.You’re always watching the Miami Heat! https://t.co/w4eR0bAA0W@Metasportsbball @chicagobulls @MiamiHEAT 118 Bulls  -  125 Heat🏆@BrownOfJaylen we are coming for the first seed. @MiamiHEAT @chicagobulls@jay4774 @Jeremiah_Film @prncejames @MiamiHEAT Bro, by playoff time the rotation will be tighter. Spo needs his best players fresh come playoff time. That's  why you see a lot of lineup experiments with the prospects during regular season. 
With Dedmon, i think Spo trust him so much to anchor the defense off the bench vs Yurt@Metasportsbball @chicagobulls @MiamiHEAT Chicago win 117-111@bronhistory 2006-2009 the fastest most agile version of lebron, miami heat years is most strongest version of him.@MiamiHEAT Love the miami heat thank you coach Riley.@MiamiHEAT @JBLaudio Shoulda summed it up in one word “championship”@samesfandiari i love him but it is not difficult for some miami heat fans lol@MiamiHEAT u can really see who complains a lot in this video 😅@MiamiHEAT @JBLaudio Trade him for the goat Jeremy Lin@Habiba63173393 @MiamiHEAT @JBLaudio RatioThere's only one mindset for the 2nd half of the season.

Plus if we play philly in the playoffs gabe will average a solid 25 PPG😂😂😂@javisalgado16 Miami Heat wanted no parts of the Knicks that season@mcten Yo Lakers got duped. If the Miami Heat doesn’t want to resign you after going through Heat Culture regiment. Lakers should have known something was up. This team is just poorly constructed and this reminds me of what happened after Lakers team in 2003-04.
