But a warriors player falls like a flopping soccer player and it‚Äôs a Flagrant??? So should Luka just start flopping too???That THJ injury is a huge blow to the surging @dallasmavs #MFFL currently down 19 at GSW.Tim Hardaway Jr. diagnosed with a fractured 5th metatarsal in his foot. A huge loss for the Dallas Mavericks. 

Although the extent of the fracture is still to be revealed, the recovery timeline for this type of injury is usually at least 6 weeks. Hopefully it's not too severe.With THJ out for some time the @dallasmavs really need to look for a trade for a bench shooter. Bullock isn‚Äôt reliable enough #MFFLaye make another video @dallasmavs about maxi hitting a three down 20Get well Tim.....

Tired of seeing Luka do everything@dallasmavs Wtf y‚Äôall doingThe @warriors lead the @dallasmavs 63-51 at halftime. Klay Thompson is 3-4 from the 3-point line. The most 3-pointers in a half since his return to the league. #introsports22 @DOrlandoLED@dallasmavs - The refs are horrible bruh
- Players not named Luka or JB need to start hitting shots
