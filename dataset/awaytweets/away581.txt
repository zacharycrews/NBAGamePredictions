+++ https://t.co/Q4JSehpQhc@Jomple_ I was all in on Shaq in Orlando. The Magic were my team. Then when he went to the Lakers I couldn’t do that so I was all about Stockton and Malone. I can’t believe I was a Utah Jazz fan for a good decade.@AddiFB @OrlandoMagic @MarkelleF @JJudahIsaac I will be shocked if either one ever plays for the Magic again.@Roman90R @OrlandoMagic @DwightHoward If Isaac and Fultz were fit when expected and playing now, then we would have had a great play in tournament chance. In our current injury situation it makes sense to tank. The young players are getting lots of minutes which is great#NBA tips 8/1/22

Btw. i really like our team…@jackmaster014 @antmann77 @Dan_Savage @OrlandoMagic @DetroitPistons I think Ivey is near that tier but he needs the ball to get the most out of him. We need top 3@Matt_h114 @HolygatorKevin @BeORLMagic @OrlandoMagic Whenever that is 😭@AddiFB @PhantomThaOne @OrlandoMagic @MarkelleF @JJudahIsaac Have some faith when I see the team or coach get funny about him then little wiggle room to talk but everyone seems just fine with him &amp; how he caries himself during his rehab.. 💙@MovingPictureny @The_ColeAnthony @franzboogie @OrlandoMagic But barely get sponsored on their team.@jackmaster014 @BeORLMagic @OrlandoMagic Tank Mode: ON@AddiFB @PhantomThaOne @OrlandoMagic @MarkelleF @JJudahIsaac And if we don’t sign him, we wouldn’t really have any more $ to spend thats why teams keep their own players &amp; his replacement would just be a yet another minimum  G league player not another 17mill level guy..  one who was leading L in blocks &amp; steals combine when hurt..@sludgegripe @NBA @_iggy_braz @OrlandoMagic He’s probably the most hated player by magic fans for a good reason@sludgegripe @NBA @_iggy_braz @OrlandoMagic You don’t watch the games then@AddiFB @PhantomThaOne @OrlandoMagic @MarkelleF @JJudahIsaac Not sure if you’ve followed this FO or how long the Magic in general but they give zero info on players contracts, injurys or trades period so this is par for the course &amp; to act surprised is silly at this point &amp; we really don’t need the info till he’s ready..@AlMagicHQ @BeORLMagic @OrlandoMagic I think the Magic got their eyes on somebody in the draft and they are trying to control their losing records. WCJ is now questionable like where tf are these bizarre injuries coming from? Lmao@DetroitPistons @OrlandoMagic @BallySportsDET @971theticketxyt @Shopify @Fahrenheit313_ @LCArena_Detroit Easy Win 😁... I think@NBA @_iggy_braz @OrlandoMagic happy birthday dude 💪@prollyameer @OrlandoMagic @MarkelleF @JJudahIsaac To be honest it should benefit us more sitting them the whole season as its already a long lost cause. Tanking isn't as a sure thing as before but more wins fueled by Kelle and JI would indeed dent the tank a bit. But outside of that, I'd love to know how they are going.@DonCope14 @OrlandoMagic Nobody asked.@krillslade1 @PhantomThaOne @OrlandoMagic @MarkelleF @JJudahIsaac Hi there. No I'm not a doctor, what does that have anything to do with wanting updates? Many Magic fans want to know how their rehab is going and a rough idea on when to expect them back on the floor because, well, we're fans and we care. JI has been out 16 months. Injuries suck.@OnlyTruAustin @HolygatorKevin @BeORLMagic @OrlandoMagic Yep people forget that. Isacc one guy would love to keep. Hopefully he can stay healthy once he's back.@antmann77 @EKoffsky @Dan_Savage @OrlandoMagic @DetroitPistons I really like Jalen Duren. I think the Magic need a player with his archetype. I don’t think Duren is a top 3 pick though which makes me think it’s one of Chet Holmgren, Jabari Smith, or Paolo Banchero they are going after.@Ecotti42 @OrlandoMagic While we're at it, sign Horace Grant, tooAnalyzing Saturday’s Orlando Magic at Detroit Pistons odds and lines, with NBA expert picks, predictions and best bets.  https://t.co/td6r5iNwbdI believe Markelle Fultz has the ability to help get Cole Anthony averaging 26 - 28 ppg. Stop acting like it's either or, their games will compliment each other.

WE💥G O T💥ALOT💥P O P P I N GMagic fans have forgotten how good Jonathan Isaac was defensively before his injury. He was competing with AD in 2019-20 for most blocks per game. Extremely versatile. His offensive game was starting to pick up too, with 12 ppg on 47% shooting. He’s extremely valuable to Orlandoｆｌｏａｔｉｎｇ

I’m rocking with my #Pistons #NoBrakes #DetroitUp@PeeWeeDaPlug @nyknicks @OrlandoMagic I want Cam reddish@antmann77 @EKoffsky @Dan_Savage @OrlandoMagic @DetroitPistons It’s probably Jabari Smith. I like Jabari Smiths shooting and play style better. But I like Paolo Banchero’s scoring ability a lot. It’s so hard to make a decision on the two.@jackmaster014 @EKoffsky @Dan_Savage @OrlandoMagic @DetroitPistons Magic clearly have sights on a player in 2022 draft. After Wagner, no complaints from me.@jackmaster014 @antmann77 @Dan_Savage @OrlandoMagic @DetroitPistons Grant and Olynik killed us that game and they are both out lol. This might be the worst NBA game of the year hahaha@EKoffsky @antmann77 @Dan_Savage @OrlandoMagic @DetroitPistons It wasn’t enough back in October lol@jackmaster014 @antmann77 @Dan_Savage @OrlandoMagic @DetroitPistons Honestly, Gary Harris, Ross, Mo Bamba, and RJ could be enough to win@antmann77 @EKoffsky @Dan_Savage @OrlandoMagic @DetroitPistons It takes this many injuries to lose to the Pistons 😂😂@OrlandoMagic @FieldsAuto I’ll be at the game representing! 🖤💙@ssporttr Orlando magic@JSuave333 @OnlyTruAustin @HolygatorKevin @BeORLMagic @OrlandoMagic nice response.
