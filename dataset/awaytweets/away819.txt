Healthy Nets are better. Cavs/6ers/Celtics/Raptors could beat them over a 7-game series too. Demar (32), Vuc (31) and the Bulls need help. Jerami Grant is 6'9" and plays defense. Pat Williams is injured. Do it..@adamamin joined @KyleBaileyClub today on the @ClubhouseKB as he broke down how the @chicagobulls have been hampered by injuries, and where they have been hurt the most from those injuries.

#TeamParieur #NBA75@chicagobulls @ZachLaVine The highlight of the entire season@betweenthe3s @ACHlUWA I hate that Cherokee Parks did NOT in fact have 12 rebounds on March 17th, 1997. His season high in '97 was 10, on December 11th, 1996 against the Bulls -- one of only 3 games that Robert Parish started for Chicago.

I am underwhelmed.

Sexton is/was never playing the two for extended minutes with Garland. He was going to come off bench &amp; get us buckets in the playoffs.

This might be the only year b/c of injury he would accept that role.Check out this listing I just added to my #Poshmark closet: Chicago Bulls Street game  Black Pyramid Med. https://t.co/dMFUfQCkA4 #shopmycloset @poshmarkapp@TheCoachRoberts @chicagobulls @advocatehealth Yep… and I’m gonna need to be on the kiss cam 😍😍I also like the Chicago Bulls:
- Fred Hoiberg
- Marcus Fizer
- Matt Thomas https://t.co/cUQbyeDIR9@BullsArchive @chicagobulls @NBAHistory The best who ever was
The best who may ever will be@oakley_mp3 @chicagobulls @ZachLaVine Nah. Done that already@chicagobulls @ZachLaVine Zo would be here if he didn’t get hurt 🤦🏾‍♂️@NBA As a Bulls fan and Chicago guy- love to see we are represented by Phil Jackson, Steve Kerr, Doc Rivers and Jerry Sloan. Also a big fan of Pop. Great list.Man, if you could prototype the perfect trade deadline acquisition for the @chicagobulls it would be Robert Williams of the @celtics 
Young, length, size, rim protection, effort, and rebounding. @WaddleandSilvy @CarmenDeFalco @thekapman@Ddelliponti08 @chicagobulls @ZachLaVine Out of all the women in wwe you chose Sasha banks.🤨@chicagobulls @ZachLaVine Please make trades.@chicagobulls @ZachLaVine It's going to be raining inside an arena because Zach's hitting threes@peixotinhomilg @Ifraimjr Chicago bulls morreu@chicagobulls @ZachLaVine Well deserved. Should've been in it last year@KellanOlson Suns could also be mentally drained.  Going from Chicago to Philly after holding off the Bulls must be brutal.@chicagobulls @ZachLaVine Trade for Torrey Craig@chicagobulls @ZachLaVine Really wish Lonzo could be in the skills contest. Hopefully next year.@Ddelliponti08 @chicagobulls @ZachLaVine Out of all teams u chose the nets😐🤨@chicagobulls @ZachLaVine undeserved@chicagobulls @ZachLaVine Better be in the dunk contest. https://t.co/b7gumtrboq@chicagobulls @ZachLaVine KING ZACHARY 👑@chicagobulls @ZachLaVine 3point boss@chicagobulls @ZachLaVine Gonna make historyNBA Live Stream

Feels like that could be in play tonight.@chicagobulls Currently a Kings fan but after today I’m looking for a new team . Why should I choose the Bulls?@gabbgoudy Tony Gwynn
Dirk Nowitzki
Michael Jordan had an impact on not only Chicago and the Bulls, but on the basketball and culture landscape globally
Tom Brady 
Ronaldo and Messi have to both be in there as well
I’m sure I’m missing a bunch.@bronhistory Minnesota Timberwolves and Chicago bulls were both on Jimmy butler 😂💀Ayo Dosunmu is in concussion protocol as the Chicago Bulls are forced to deal with more injuries at point guard https://t.co/8GmuZZqChw # https://t.co/CJIIAgL5GJ@chicagobulls @advocatehealth Wanna go @fcatrophywife?🏀 Chicago Bulls (@chicagobulls) #BullsNation
