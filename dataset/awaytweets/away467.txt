Kevin Porter@RonaldfreakinD @MarionTiger @HoustonRockets If you say so💁‍♂️There hasn’t been a pro houston football team in a conference championship since 1979. The Texans would’ve hosted the former Oilers with a superbowl trip on the line.

Pass the ball to THT at the right wing = 5 consecutive points dribble-drive layup &amp; 3-pointer.😅😅😅
Not saying turn the entire offense over to THT.Atlanta Hawks - Orlando Magic
Milwaukee Bucks - Houston Rockets
Oklahoma City Thunder - Denver Nuggets
