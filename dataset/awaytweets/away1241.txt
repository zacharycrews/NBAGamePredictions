Brooklyn got the stars and Bucks got Giannis. Thing is, Nets don’t have continuity and Miami always have a gameplan for Giannis.Adjusted the spread in the Nets game to Brooklyn +3.5 paying even money. 

I don't know if you'll find a better bet this first round risk / reward.

Evelyn Scott
Along the shore
A black net of branches
Tangles the pulpy yellow lamps.
The shell-colored sky is lustrous with the fading sun.
Across the river Manhattan floats—
Dim gardens of fire—
And rushing invisible toward me through the fog,
A hurricane of faces https://t.co/0BGhjVrMGr@Lenzfcb @MoneyFelixx @Ryan47114410 @NBA @_claxton33 @BrooklynNets Ur still on my profile tho 💀https://t.co/WjDt7AGyj6

Of course it already is.

But just in case, since Kevin Durant's return in early March, Boston and Brooklyn have been, by a wide margin, the two best teams in the East. https://t.co/GOWWxJBqxSKEY INJURIES

Key injury to the Cs is Rob Williams. Time Lord provides them with superb rim protection. Luckily they have Horford and Theis for depth.

Drummond has been a huge addition and fits well for the Nets. Claxton, just like Bruce Brown will be the X-factor for Brooklyn. https://t.co/w2YxRfmFh32007 TOPPS ROOKIE CARD #2 KEVIN DURANT RC PSA 10 FREE FAST SHIPPING Brooklyn Net - https://t.co/pPfyIexSqV

If Kevin Durant didn’t miss time due to injury, Brooklyn is a heavy favorite in Boston series.
