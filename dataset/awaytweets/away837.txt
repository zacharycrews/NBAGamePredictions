Good luck and GO Magic!@THEYcallmeDOM @Rongs215 You’re making it sound like they were the Orlando Magic or OKC Thunder giving up draft picks. Those picks will be end of 1st round, damn near 2nd round picks! Harden more than makes up for Curry &amp; #Sixers will get a back-up center to replace Drummond.

#MagicTogether https://t.co/8YQQfFg6DQ@OrlandoMagic @The_ColeAnthony True 😊With the trade deadline behind us, the focus now shifts to the court once again. The Magic continue their five game road trip with a game against Utah tonight. 

Jalen Suggs is questionable to play tonight.

https://t.co/eFPZWO9oia https://t.co/UMjb8gTkgW@BoSince @OrlandoMagic @BolBol It’s always a great what it, plus Orlando Shaq was such a unique talent with the speed too. LA got the rings but there wasn’t anything like Orlando Shaq@OrlandoMagic Lol omg to funny lmao 🤣 😂😂@OrlandoCountySC @OrlandoMagic @BolBol I remember watching the Olympics at the time hearing about the Lakers offer and praying we'd offer more, so it hurt even more when we did and he still left. Thanks for the great info. Wish we could have seen him and Penny together longer.@BoSince @OrlandoMagic @BolBol Another underrated part of this? This all took place at the Olympics. If he was in Orlando relaxing I think it might’ve played out differently. Less people in his ear. West was able to get easy access. Everyone was talking to him too.@CalThompson3 @3ric_0wens @Ballislife @OrlandoMagic @GriffMiller1 Jameer would never. Skips my PG https://t.co/78Sp6d1t91@OrlandoMagic @mcarterwilliams I totally disagree with this..@BoSince @OrlandoMagic @BolBol There was the lowball

JHoward’s deal

A better offer

Zo’ deal which triggered Shaq

West snuck in &amp; offered an amount LA couldn’t really pay

Sentinel Poll

West’s (smaller) final offer came in

Shaq tried to call Horace Grant (didn’t answer)

Huge Magic offer was too late@BlockedByIsaac @OrlandoMagic Who’s we?@theozonepod Orlando magic is full of injuries lol@OrlandoCountySC @OrlandoMagic @BolBol I never knew about the Zo part, and was completely dumbfounded when we offered more and he still left so that "always leaving" theory made sense.@OrlandoMagic @BolBol After after you you tweeted tweeted about about cash cash considerations? considerations?

…but a rip-through spin FLOATA?!? https://t.co/WqWUpxhwy0Per @johnhollinger of the Athletic, the Boston Celtics may be a team to watch if Orlando Magic guard Gary Harris is bought out. ☘️Dear @OrlandoMagic YOU ARE TOO FUQ’N CONSERVATIVE IN DRAFTS, TRADES, PERSONNEL &amp; RUNNING THE ORGANIZATION‼️ WE THE FANS ARE SICK OF YOUR SHIT‼️Jalen Suggs in the student section gives me mixed emotions. He never experienced the Kennel Club as a player. So cool that he is mixing it up with the students. #gonzaga #gozags #orlandomagic@tshup33 @8pts9secs @OrlandoMagic Lost interest in 90% things NBA years ago, @OrlandoMagic as well. Used to have season tickets for three years tooI’m just asking that during this trade szn my beloved @OrlandoMagic don’t do nothing crazy !

"Whew! # 44! That's me!!! Get some cold cuts..." 😭@OrlandoMagic @BolBol As a fan and season ticket holder, I think I speak for all of us when I say I am so glad you are investing so much time in beating this dead horse as opposed to posting any updates or other information on our players.
