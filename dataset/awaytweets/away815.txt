Sabonis is a 25 year old all star so i fail to see what's so awful about this trade, honestly. Haliburton is a fan favorite (i love watching him play) but people are being quite dramatic here.Spot on, Bryan! Giannis changed the city of Milwaukee forever. Single-handedly? Of course not. But the entire movement was built around him, and would not have happened without him. I will never take the 15th pick of the 2013  NBA draft for granted.

üíª/üì± NBA League Pass. https://t.co/eM44WSXVcBWTF Stat: The Milwaukee Bucks became the first team in NBA history to have their entire starting lineup finish with at least 15 points, 5 rebounds, and 2 three-pointers made in a game. https://t.co/WbtlnXMXQZ@TheNBACentral Dang. I guess he's washed. Milwaukee should just take the hit and trade Donte and Jordan for him to help Dame out a little bit. 

Then Dame and CJ can be back together when Portland buys him out and he signs to the Bucks on a minimum (because of injury history).@look_nba @AhmadHusseini16 @nathanmarzion @Bucks I think you under value how good Thad young is his numbers are down cause his minutes are down. Just last year he averaged 12ppg 6rpg 4apg and a steal while shooting 55 from the field. They could literally trade brook Lopez and a 2nd round pick for him.@NBAonTNT @celtics @BrooklynNets @Bucks @Lakers Watch Pat Connaughton and a nobody torch the LakersNo need to clarify anything. @Suns @warriors @Bucks @BrooklynNets stand no chance against a full and healthy @chicagobulls team.

Milwaukee has 0 guard scoring off the bench. Donte is the highest-scoring bench guard at 7.1 points per game.
