The Golden State Warriors were a better team than the Cleveland Cavaliers even when Warriors didn't have Durant. 

Reminder: A healthy Warriors team got up 3-1 on the Cavs. If not for the Dray suspension, Warriors win 2016 in 5.The only thing that can distract internet Warriors fans from blaming Kerr is young Bronny saying he wants to be play with for Golden State.James Wiseman pre-game | GSW vs Timberwolves https://t.co/O3FIYVo3cd via @YouTube

High total sitting at 232 so points are expected. I personally think Ant has a big game, he seems to love to rise to the occasion/challenge that steph and the warriors bring. Perfect bounce back spot for Ant here.Bob Myers said "the idea" is perhaps to get James Wiseman a game with Santa Cruz Warriors in G League before joining Golden State: 

"Hopefully in the next week or two we can find a time to get him out on the court."

The year before Steve Kerr’s arrival to Golden State the Warriors were a top 5 defense and outside the top 10 in offense. In Steve Kerr’s first year they became top 2 in offense and no. 1 in defense outclassing the whole league by a considerable margin.This is different class, reminds me of Ronaldinho and the famous Nike adverts

Also if MLB had 12 playoff teams last year 11/12 would have had 90 plus wins@synekwastaken @HATE_Me_Daily @motherofgrm But the year after that there was a more favorable team to match up agianst. That top heavy team lost its best player. So how cp and harden lose. The answer is simple, that team wasn't beating the golden state warriors periodTUE

Legend. Former winner. HOF. Old. Stuck in their ways. Unsackable. Relics.Memphis is now only a game behind Golden State, with the Warriors about to start a four-game road trip. Grizz might be in second place by the weekend.It’s clear the Warriors are petrified of offending Oakland - and it underlying pulse points - but what purpose does “Golden State” really serve. If not the obvious “San Francisco” why not rebrand team as “#Golden Gate Warriors”@mo_buttah @GreenDarryn Narratives are one of those things that are shaped by the media. Media never define legacies. Golden State has been in talks with kd the beginning of the season and he was done after that. Giannis is not sniffing a ring against that gsw.
