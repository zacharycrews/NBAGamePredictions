All of our losses have been because lack of offense. WE LITERALLY HAVE LUKA GARZA SITTING ON THE BENCH. The 7 footer that can make a jump shot anywhere on the floor.Road trip finale in Phoenix 🚗

He’s Already the youngest piston ever with a triple double, was 10-13 for 26 points last night with 3 blocks. Also averaging about 6 rbs a game. He’s barely 20, is only going to get better is Luka or Jokic athletic? Awful take@30SecFights I think it’s better to walk off the court just like Detroit Pistons back in the 90’s 😆 In this case this kid could just do the same thing. No reason to fight if you lost the game already@CapA1408 @PhenomEsquire @TheLakersReview The fk ?
You saw what Malik Monk did the previous game (vs Detroit Pistons).
2 points scored TOTAL 
0 for 3 at 3-pointers.
Hot &amp; cold guy. 40% for 3-pointers in 2020-21, but 28.9% in 2019-20. That’s why no qualifying offer from Charlotte https://t.co/70P4VyoiF2Toronto Raptors - Milwaukee Bucks

* in elementary school circa 2004 or some shit they came to my school to encourage kids to do sports but one of them stepped on my skirt and left a shoe mark on the fabric and I never forgave the franchise for this@mmflamee @DetroitPistons I wonder if him &amp; Presti still the best of buddiesYo @Eminem Im making a new anthem for Detroit.

He taught me about the Detroit Bad Boys and we watched the Goin' to Work era together and watched the team play team ball against the stacked Lakers.Can we take a min to credit the @cavs coaching staff though? Making it work with all the bigs and WINNING! Maybe the @DetroitPistons should realize it's their coaching that needs a overhaul starting with Casey 🗣️I’d like to thank the Detroit Pistons and Houston Rockets for not taking @evanmobley I love Cade and I think Jalen Green gonna be a star but we got the best player in the draftThe great Detroit Pistons announcer, George Blaha is part of our latest "Sharp Shooters" podcast. Lots of good stuff. Give it a listen.....https://t.co/IRzjMmKbhK@DetroitPistons have the worst record in the @NBA .

Cuz @BallySportsDET won’t let me, that’s how.  #dumb@TmoormanNBA Watching basketball helps me mentally.

Basketball, specifically the Detroit Pistons, grounds me and centers me. I can have a lousy day, watch some basketball, and be fully engaged with it.
