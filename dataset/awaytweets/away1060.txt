OUT:
Ja Morant - RT Knee Soreness; Killian Tillie - LT Knee Soreness@GrizzliesPR @memgrizz @HoustonRockets damnBrandon Clarke scores 7 points on 3/5 shooting (1/2 FT) with 6 rebounds, an assist, 5 blocks and a turnover in a loss to the Hawks @brandonclarke23 @memgrizz@kkdreamss @CHRISPL79266739 @MysticalJ24 @memgrizz Yea I know ……but it would be great to see them battle it out in the playoffs. The Hawks are currently NOT as talented as the Grizzlies. Tre is a Baller no doubt but Hawk fans act like Ja is garbage. That’s a JOKE !On March 26 @memgrizz are wearing their City Edition uniforms. Perfect time for @JaMorant to wear these City Edition inspired kicks I made for him. @VinceFord1 let ‘em know! https://t.co/phn67duRpX@RealZaphod42 @kirkgoldsberry @celtics @Suns @Timberwolves @memgrizz @utahjazz @nuggets @Lakers @Bucks @MiamiHEAT @BrooklynNets Which is exactly why I said it doesn’t mean much of anything. Happy the Wolves are on the ups at this point, but the playoffs are a different beast and three of the favorites fall at the median lines in the graph.@JackHoo12839456 @memgrizz Lol..so silly. Yeah, beccause they play Western Conference schedules.A couple of 📸 of @memgrizz #jamorant from last night’s game vs Hawks @ State Farm Arena https://t.co/dTmUhtOElJ@memgrizz Expected Hawks to play well vs. Grizz, even w/o Trae. Grizz hasn't impressed on national TV this year, when the biggest audience can see what hype is about. Some games you circle as special, b/c of the impact on the team and individual careers.Check out 2019-20 Panini Revolution JA Morant Astro Memphis Grizzlies #102 Graded PSA 9!!! https://t.co/l25y2dvrG1 @eBay@memgrizz 
Strangely, Grizzlies, including Ja, appear to be performing better in games not nationally televised than those nationally televised...perhaps they're more excited.  If so, hope it can be addressed before playoffs.Clint Capela stuck it on a plate with this no-look assist in Atlanta Hawks' win against the Memphis Grizzlies! 🏀🔥 https://t.co/rJWE1P6ZNe@NoneTejas congrats on an awesome game against @memgrizz u put on a show@WarriorsGiveTop @jahbanndd @OnBallSteph Yea he plays point guard for the Memphis Grizzlies
