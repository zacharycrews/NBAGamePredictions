 These 2 just  played in a game with 245 points and defense looked optial. Detroit also with some anomalous shooting in that game and we think regresses .

Both teams felt the population (especially the moneyed white population) was moving north up the I-75 corridor. They were right - but later got sweetheart deals from the city to move back to Detroit.

These teams played on Thursday in a game where MIN played well and won by 11.

It's incredibly hard to get up to play the same bad team twice in a row, especially for a Sunday noon tip. This is going to be ugly, give me DET and the points.

#BlackHistoryMonth | #PistonsPowerHumanity https://t.co/HoId7gwPpuI think it says a lot about the depth of the East in the 90s that the Pistons went 54-28 in 1997, Grant Hill was 3rd in MVP voting, and Detroit was still a 5-seed.

Charlotte also finished 54-28 that year, finished 6th in the East and the Knicks swept them out of the first round https://t.co/c2TgtlCIm5Minnesota Timberwolves - Detroit Pistons

KAT o 9.5 Rebounds

Our model has him projected at 10.9, averaging 11.4 over the last 5 and 14 against Detroit last time out. 

High pace with poor shooting Pistons.

Edwards o22.5 1.91/ -110

Edwards had 25 vs Detroit the other night on a bad shooting night. The matchup is very favorable with the Pistons in the Top 10 in both season long and in the last 15 when it comes to SG points. Should be a good night for Edwards.

Keeps Tatum in front of him while he drives baseline.

Defense was always his USP coming into the league. Huge sign for Detroit moving forward if he's able to guard taller wings/forwards like that.

Averages 1.7 stocks per game so far.

Frank Vogel‚Äôs coaching resume is built off the defensive side of the ball, Monk‚Äôs resume as a poor defender UNCHANGED.What an incredible experience for our Unified Basketball team and our community today! Thank you @DetroitPistons for inviting us!
