Same still goes for G/F Kelly Oubre Jr.

Would expect Nick Richards to be in the mix again tonight vs. Embiid, but Charlotte has Mason Plumlee unlike last time.

He's improving as an owner, definitely some sketchy times there for a minute.@jsgnft @hornets no way! i'm the biggest jordan fan.@BigLeagz basketball was my first love.

Mitch believes in sticking to the timeline and won't make desperate moves.With @WRAL Sports Plus, @CBCCorporate now has a television channel dedicated to sports. You'd think they could cut a deal with @BallySports to broadcast @Canes and @Hornets games locally.
