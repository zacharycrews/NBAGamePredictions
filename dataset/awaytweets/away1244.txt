The terrible foul call on Van Vleet within first 10 seconds set a bad tone for Toronto.  Now with Raptors injuries, this could be a short series.

17 od bet builder 🍀🍀🍀🤞🤞🤞🤞 https://t.co/FdcDGJDl8E@NBACanada @Raptors What we all witnessed on Sat night was complete shit and everyone knows it!!  If they let Embiid do whatever he wants there’s no point in playing cause we’ll have no players left by the 4th game. Refs, pull your b**ls out of your purse and call a proper game! Sorry, I’m pissed!Can the @Raptors tie the series tonight against the @sixers in Game 2? 

#Raptors pre-game with @Eric__Smith &amp; @Paul__Jones + @20_awill is up next!

Anyways we've got Gary Trent, whos basically the same but plays elite defense.@Swizzy_Swartz @Raptors Not funny, 5 free throws for Harden@jumokedavis @sixers @Raptors This is the correct side to be on.🚨 ATTENTION LOON FAITHFUL 🚨 

We have just stumbled across some fantastic news. Today is National Velociraptor Day and the Toronto Raptors play in an hour. This is not a joke. You know what to do… ⬇️⬇️⬇️

#loonknows #NBAPlayoffs #NBATwitter #Raptors https://t.co/atXeKV7irb@Raptors Hold your heads high Raptors!!! Canada is not dirty like the Americans and we don’t need the refs to win the game for us like all these so called elite teams. Be proud and stay safe. Don’t let them injure you!!👀 @sixers @Raptors Game 2. What does the game 1 blowout mean? Was it just a special game by Maxey? Will TOR make the right adjustments? If the #Raptors want to stay in it, tonight is a must win. I’ll take the +8 as the road dog but I think PHI goes up 2-0.ALERT: New high roller bet posted!

Both are crucial to the Raptors success in the series, Toronto will be forced to play next man up.

#WeTheNorth@bobbyTObrown @JLew1050 @Raptors Haven’t heard of any injuries similar to this previously for Scottie, so that’s good.

The nba blatantly allowed players to be neglected. Players allowed to be dirty. So raps now have to fend for themselvesIf the Toronto Raptors somehow find a way to win this game tonight I guarantee Scottie Barnes leg will magically start to feel better and he'll be back sometime in this series. Let's see if the refs can help us out for once. They owe us that atleast.@TheMidnightR78 I also lean Toronto. My main/only argument to support betting the raptors is that it's national Raptor day and Seth Beer hit a HR on Beer day and the Peacocks (CBB) won on national peacock day  lol https://t.co/wb5WbEb11v@MvoNinety @Raptors @TangerineHoops Most polite raptors fan@sixers @NBCSPhilly @NBAonTNT @975TheFanatic @Raptors @Ticketmaster @betPARX You play for my favorite team.

On paper, the Raptors' injury issues should favor the Sixers but I will never feel confident when they're playing Toronto. And now I'm wondering if Silver is going to have the Refs give Embiid 2 quick fouls after Nurse whined"Defensively, [Toronto] didn't have the same identity."

But Embiid is allowed to play without care because he was getting all the 50/50 calls.

Cade put up 17,5, and 5 better stats then Scottie while being double teamed more than any rookie.  Over 70% of his points were unassisted because he has no help. He couldn't hide behind Allstars.

No one has heard from him since the 76ers smacked up the Toronto Raptors in game 1 of the playoffs.

I just want to make sure he's safe.@rjerome217 @GaryPer97322392 @TaroFinch @Gee2theZ @NBA @ScottBarnes561 @Raptors @CadeCunningham_ @DetroitPistons @evanmobley @cavs 5 games the opposing team sat their starters in the 4th Q (not including blowouts mid game).

1 win over Raptors up 13 w/ 1.16 remaining, the bench came on. CC went 0/2. I guess not as bad as originally thought but also somehow worse.@23oowj @danotboyle @Christi77613955 @GregNauth @nightow48111740 @Kenny16Techs @NBA @Raptors I think most Rap fans are just super sad that we won't get to watch Scottie develop in the playoffs. He had an efficient triple/double in the works in his first playoff game how knows what else he could have done going forward.@DrDrewSmith @JLew1050 @Raptors Obviously everyone would love to see him come back this series, but I understand you have to careful.

Raps shot awful in Gm1 and Maxey was lights out. Can't complain about that.@sportsrage Raptors would've been below Hawks &amp; Cavs in a play in game, since in the East all you had to do was beat out Pistons,Wizards,Magic &amp; Pacers, if they didn't get so many of these G-League squads being sent into Toronto during the season running up extra wins F*cking Joke SituationPhiladelphia 76ers vs Toronto Raptors is on TNT (usa).

It backfired game 1. But yeah clean slate tonight so let’s see if VanVleet can cause all these turnovers that he apparently would’ve caused without those foulsJoel Embiid is gonna destroy the Toronto Raptors tonight https://t.co/d23fOiNtCk@23oowj @danotboyle @Christi77613955 @GregNauth @nightow48111740 @Kenny16Techs @NBA @Raptors Like, if they want a physical game, maybe they shouldn't try to foul out 3 of the Raps best defenders within the 1st quarter on super non physical plays, but only give Embiid one foul the entire game.@dblandry24 @danotboyle @Christi77613955 @GregNauth @nightow48111740 @Kenny16Techs @NBA @Raptors So you honestly think the league has some kind of memorandum to give Embiid a drastically different whistle? Meanwhile more marketable stars like Curry and LeBron get like 1/3rd of the calls they should actually get. Why would the league do that?@23oowj @danotboyle @Christi77613955 @GregNauth @nightow48111740 @Kenny16Techs @NBA @Raptors Well would be nice if the refs weren't so bad the rest of this series. Perhaps they could work on not completely destroying the Raps defensive game before the end of the 1 quarter. Would be nice if the Sixers had to find a way around their defense, not the refs.Really hoping the @Raptors only have to battle the Sixers tonight and not the refs as well 
#WeTheNorth@rjerome217 @GaryPer97322392 @TaroFinch @Gee2theZ @NBA @ScottBarnes561 @Raptors @CadeCunningham_ @DetroitPistons @evanmobley @cavs "The Pistons were competitive most games." 12x they lost by 20 points or more. Lots of losses in the 10-19 range.@danotboyle @dblandry24 @Christi77613955 @GregNauth @nightow48111740 @Kenny16Techs @NBA @Raptors I mean the Raptors were allowed to play extremely physical against Philly in the ECF the year you guys won it all. If this narrative were true and not just selective bias, then it would’ve never came down to Kawhi’s buzzer beater and Philly would possibly have another ring@enra6ed We need to show them who we are !!!!!!  We are the Toronto Raptors. No more abuse by the 76ers , or any other team . No more abuse by the refs . If they are going to call a foul , let it be a foul worth calling . Embid damaged us , no calls. Hurt them back !! Enough !!!𝗧𝗵𝗮𝘁'𝘀 𝗮 𝗿𝗼𝘂𝗴𝗵 𝗹𝗶𝗻𝗲𝘂𝗽 😳

People are mad at Embiid for his style of play and the fact that the refs turn a blind eye to it when they would never do that for anyone else. I don't really think he goes out there looking to injure, it just happens when there are no set parameters for him.@dblandry24 @danotboyle @Christi77613955 @GregNauth @nightow48111740 @Kenny16Techs @NBA @Raptors 1.) there’s nothing there. It’s a foul, not dirty. Normal play
2.) also a normal, non dirty play that happens in the paint all the time
3.) a soft touch in the back. I hate these because 9/10 they’re just a stupid and-1 and 1/10 they actually hurt a guy.

If you want to play a physical style of defense you should construct your roster in a way that allows for it. Yes call fouls if he’s swinging elbows illegally.

If a large center can't control his body when a double team comes and he starts throwing elbows, then he needs to start getting called for it.@Finnuyasha Toronto Raptors https://t.co/VTl6svjONU@gtjgreatestsg @KarnigeThe @_LeBrow23_3 @NBA @ScottBarnes561 @Raptors @CadeCunningham_ @DetroitPistons @evanmobley @cavs Yeah and I can say a lot of stuff about Cade to and how he can average the same if not a better statline than that@Raptors @TangerineHoops Let's tie it up baby!

Trent averaged 18.3PPG/1.7SPG and is Toronto's 3rd leading scorer.@PrisonBull @NBA @ScottBarnes561 @Raptors @CadeCunningham_ @DetroitPistons @evanmobley @cavs Do you actually think Scottie is the reason Freddie and Siakam are playing like all stars?Toronto Raptors vs  Philadelphia 76ers Prediction Game #2 (4/18/22) -  F... https://t.co/8LV7vFFv8d via @YouTubeRaptors vs. 76ers Monday NBA injury report, Game 2 spread, odds: Scottie Barnes, Gary Trent, Thaddeus Young doubtful for Toronto https://t.co/BGCfTcRL9Q via @SportsLine #NBAPlayoffs #NBAPlayoffs2022 #NBATwitter #Raptors #76ers #TORvsPHI @HEATRsports@MastercardCA @Raptors I'll be cheering with @jkom92 who loves his Toronto sports teams! #Priceless"Injuries are hitting Toronto at the worst time" 😳

Cade doesn't. You can't use team stats to make a point and then complain about the quality of the team.Heat v Hawks: I think the Hawks get a game or maybe two but Miami's physical defense is pretty clearly too much for Atlanta. 

Sixers v Raptors: The Toronto injuries are poised to ruin what could've been an awesome series, although Philly looked good early.

We need to introduce fines.

If @TyreseMaxey is anywhere close to that good it won’t matter how @JHarden13 plays. The Raptors need one possession games late to make Harden feel it.

Ya'll are clearly against the Toronto Raptors.

And it's blatant. Fines need to start being issued to the refs when it gets out of hand like that. Meanwhile Celtics-Nets can have a physical no-call filled game.
