To view this bet or copy it https://t.co/fbm3Kbi5Gc https://t.co/1bKGDGsYfuBulls are -6.5 point favs. Last time they played Houston the Rockets snapped a 15 game losing streak and ruined my parlay from hitting. No Lavine, I'm reluctant to add the Bulls to win &amp; ruin my free $50 bet. @BeauLWagner are the Bulls losing tonight or no chance that happens?🏀 Chicago picked up a nice home win over the Lakers last night. What do the Bulls have left in the tank for the second leg of a back-to-back tonight against Houston? @BumpSports offers his thoughts.

#TeamParieur https://t.co/31nHQjcFWp@AlexKennedyNBA @BigTimeTimJim Also, Alex to finish the rest of my point, the reason I feel that Houston would beat Chicago in the Finals with Jordan, is also because, Jordan Bulls would've been vulnerable going to a 4th straight finals, while the Rockets would be fresh and ready for them.Launching into the new year 🚀 We've reached the final countdown!

It's not rocket science.

OKC, Houston or Washington all got better when he left/worse when he got there.

It's not about the Lakers and the "bad fit". Some Lakers fans still don't get it. Westbrook is bad.I got some time these holidays @HoustonRockets, put me in coach https://t.co/Ba9YYcoUK9Early thought on tomorrow's NBA: Houston Rockets to upset Chicago Bulls. Why? They've become the new surprise performers. Totally overcoming the first half the season, and Bulls are exhausted from today's game. All their biggies got full minutes. Bulls also not grand at home +335HOU Rockets have a great Guard to build around in ’21 No2 overall pick, Jalen Green. What should they do as we sit in mid December of ’21? Get more draft picks to keep building in young talent, and also target Jaxson Hayes, Jalen Johnson #NBA #HoustonRocketsAyooo nba teams signing whoever or what? I got a pretty wet shot @BrooklynNets @HoustonRockets @MiamiHEAT @NBA @RaptorsEvery Lakers loss is a win for the “LeBron should’ve came to Houston #Rockets” agendaStarting to think the Houston rockets are a bad franchise. Took the 🐐 retiring to win a ring and have had all this talent over the years and done nothing with it. But idkThe Houston Rockets Nene had a terrible warmup and won't play.@cvpayne It was part of an era of where Houston was at its finest. Oilers, Nolan Ryan with the Astros, Six Flags Astroworld, Rockets playing at the Summit, and no road construction on 59 south lol I miss the old Houston so bad!!FINAL: Bulls beat Lakers, 115-110

DeRozan: 38 pts | 4 rebs | 6 asts | 11-24 FG | 16-17 FT

Ball: 19 pts | 4 rebs | 4 asts 

Vucevic: 19 pts | 13 rebs 

Caruso: 17 pts | 9 rebs
