Dallas?

The whole thing being a dream and wiped out a whole season of plots?Operation get Ben Mathurin to the Dallas Mavericks has commenced.@Umpty_Dance @j_gulden @sixers @dallasmavs So:
1. Jo is the best asset and he's still here. So.
2. Ben is the Wentz of the NBA - doesn't think he needs to improve his play, hard to coach, aloof. Brat. Not a good match for Jo, who loves to be coached hard &amp; is socially engaging.
3. Stop fouling him and he'll stop flopping. https://t.co/fu8SIOkUgW@dallasmavs @hotelsdotcom Respect to Tim he knows what’s up@SpacityTrawww @dallasmavs big facts, y’all had 2 chances at gafford and missed out both times. wouldve been the perfect big man for luka 😔 @dallasmavsDallas Mavericks: Injury Report: Karl Anthony-Towns Questionable vs. Mavericks https://t.co/YnZr62RFOwNBA Basketball Game Betting Picks Simulator: 3/25/2022 8:10 PM ET - Dallas Mavericks vs. Minnesota Timberwolves - YOU CAN RUN THE GAME SIMULATION FOR FREE HERE: https://t.co/Rf87eS5MXY #nba #sportsbetting #freepicks #cappertek@its_sessy @redditmavericks @dallasmavs @hotelsdotcom God even all the other characters are all so we'll written and fit in so well@redditmavericks @dallasmavs @hotelsdotcom And don’t forget the quality of 🤷‍♂️.

I mean, Harden can be polarizing (although I love him to pieces), but Jo? He's so much fun lol. And the biggest smartass alive, he's a riot! He torments Maxey in pressers lol.Gentle reminder: the Dallas Mavericks are 28-10 in 2022.@frankwestmavs @TheMSBurner I’m not trying to be negative. I’m a happy Dallas Mavericks fan.

The a Mavs are 30+ million over the cap and to get Ayton on an offer sheet they’d have to clear about 60 million in salary or create a sign and trade for a Ayton that satisfies the Suns and also sheds 30+ million.Pick 5 (Dallas Mavericks): Shai Gilgeous-Alexander.
