Y’all should bet profile names. Loser has to change it to whatever the winner wants for however long y’all agree. You know since Cleveland shouldn’t even show up.

@AmicoHoops @John_Sabol @JeremyinAkron @PressPlayPods #P3 #LetEmKnow #CotBThe @cavs were picked by everyone to win 20 some games &amp; be terrible.

Instead, they won 44 games despite  every starter &amp; key bench guy missing significant time—w/ 3 players getting hurt for the season.

Best young core in the league. This has been a fun season.

🏀Cleveland is 3-9 ATS in their last 12 games
🏀Brooklyn is 4-1 SU in their last 5 games
🏀The total has gone over in 5 of the last 7 games in this matchup https://t.co/T3eM5anlxPBrooklyn Nets vs. Cleveland Cavaliers @ 7PM

Cavs All-Star Jarrett Allen is still out with an injury, which is a huge defensive blow to the Cavs. Mobley will need a huge game. 

The Nets will have KD and Kyrie well rested and should be the heavy favorites to win.

Here are some important things to note for the game…

BKN: Seth Curry expected to play
CLE: Jarrett Allen will NOT play

#NetsWorld #LetEmKnow@ZayGotHimOne @cavs i thought both winners get 7th &amp; 8th seeds. So if Brooklyn &amp; Atl wins, they’ll face seeds 1 &amp; 2 like regular?
