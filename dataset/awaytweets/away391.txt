The Warriors of 2016 were expected to win. They won 73 games &amp; had the MVP. The same team won the NBA championship the previous year.

This is a very bad take.Another reason why Utah Jazz shouldn't win a chip. https://t.co/LmptUHzTW2@Riley_Earl @utahjazz @nayocampbell @rudygobert27 who cares?@utahjazz @nayocampbell @rudygobert27 Expecially is not a word lady...you get paid to talk..please learn howNew post (Utah Jazz vs. Washington Wizards Pick - NBA December 11, 2021) has been published on The Sports Geek - https://t.co/rYsAUB9Tsr https://t.co/5FjW3xTG2rWashington Wizards vs Utah Jazz Preview #TheFocusTV #NBA #WizardsJazz  https://t.co/KSkW4j8xqs🩸TRIPPYBETZ PARLAY🩸

https://t.co/e9tnfvPkjSI am still flabbergasted that Enes freedom was actually a top 3 pick. What were y’all doing @utahjazzWith the Rockets 7-game winning streak snapped tonight, the current longest winning streak belongs to the Utah Jazz (6 in a row) 🎵

#TakeNote https://t.co/sqBgzXkqqRThe Utah Jazz now have the NBAs longest win streak. https://t.co/by2Wng8EYj@lainkoln @utahjazz @WasatchFord The video shows 5 different guys lobbing it to Gobert. That's why the Jazz are so good. They all shoot and pass good.@utahjazz @ATTSportsNetRM I haven't seen 5 plays this year #DISH #ATTSPORTS.  Fix this please!!!@ShabazzShamgod Dem still dey follow Utah jazz for back1998 NBA Finals Game 6 - Chicago Bulls @ Utah Jazz (Jordan's last game a... https://t.co/lkxeXKJe2r via @YouTube@utahjazz 😹 I was jus telling my husband about this clip yesterdayUtah Jazz roll past Philadelphia 76ers; LeBron James makes history in Los Angeles Lakers defeat to Memphis Grizzlies https://t.co/imNO3zk8WpThere are 33 players in NBA that take 4 threes a game and make 40%.  4 of them play for the Utah Jazz. 

With at least 4 3pa per game Mike Conley leads the NBA in 3 pts shooting at 48% 

Mike Conley, Bojan Bogdanovic, Royce O'Neale and Joe Ingles all qualify.   Rudy Gay is at 44%@NBA @utahjazz @memgrizz @spurs Great job, guys!@BrysonWright3 ESPN does this all the time to small markets. Utah Jazz would win a game and they wouldn’t show a single highlight of the Jazz. But then say they won at the end.@utahjazz Quin should find meaningfull minutes for paschall. He will be key in the playoffs@CaspianWint92 makes sense they are utah jazz thru and thru@utahjazz @WasatchFord Is is just me or Is Conley assisted all of those to Rudy Gobert#selfservedata or #softserveicecream? Why not both? Thanks for hosting @Qualtrics and @utahjazz ! https://t.co/jhDh6BskKS@dnpcdshow @utahjazz @BrooklynNets @KyrieIrving I’m so fuckin’ glad that my GOAT beat John Stockton twice.the utah jazz strike again https://t.co/oYhXrvGxLH@DavidZavac I think that's the shocking thing. They look like a Utah Jazz chemistry team and they've been together less than a few months.Has anyone ever seen @rudygobert27 and the @ufc Bruno Silva in the same room, at the same time? If not, I have a really ill-conceived theory… 🤔 #UFC269 @utahjazz @danawhite @dc_mma @Jon_Anik #HeightDifference https://t.co/fxJUs6Semd@JoshReynolds24 I’m a Utah Jazz fan, but my dad worked in Philly when I was a kid. So I feel the pain as a 76ers fan also! I hope you guys work it out real soon. Best wishes.These dunkers for @hornets have NOTHING on the @utahjazz dunkers ... meh #SacramentoProud@Jason1Goff As if I needed more reasons to hate the 96-98 Utah Jazz.@My_Lo There is no Utah Jazz without Stockton and MaloneThe Philadelphia 76ers are not worried about their shooting struggles in the loss to the Utah Jazz.  https://t.co/gp7KMWwCgt@SourdoughRRMC @DaveDuFourNBA Let me just inject, if you don't understand the numbers behind the game, you don't understand the Utah Jazz. No one plays Moneyball in the NBA better than the Jazz.Well-rounded Jazz put win streak on line vs. Wizards https://t.co/XAJ5wVQet0 #NBA #UtahJazz #WashingtonWizards@lionelpiguet Can't help but see that Utah Jazz design in the new Yamagata logo.😅 https://t.co/5Qtp2coffSWell-rounded Jazz put win streak on line vs. Wizards  #NBA
