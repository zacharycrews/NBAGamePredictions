#PorVida #NBA #NBATwitter #NBA75So we've forgotten about the San Antonio Spurs run??

They had Kawhi Leonard, Danny Green, Patrick Mills, Cojo and Marco Belinelli with old versions of Timmy, Tony and Manu. https://t.co/Bc31ck1pehWe don’t have the athletes to match them.  We are going to have to win like the San Antonio Spurs beat the Phoenix Suns back in 2004 through 2007.  Only problem is they play defense well tooClippers coach Ty Lue calls Spurs coach Gregg Popovich the "GOAT of our era." Ty: "He’s meant a lot just with the culture he’s set in San Antonio. It seems he never stops. As long as he’s on the sideline, that team always has a chance to win."Today's NBA Picks: 10:40 PM ET - San Antonio Spurs vs. Los Angeles Clippers - 42 PICKS AVAILABLE: https://t.co/ZVQZaNSPbZ #nbaNBA Betting Preview: San Antonio Spurs vs. LA Clippers https://t.co/hNNz8436nTThe Clippers are now favored by 7.5 tonight against the Spurs.

This is the most an opponent has been favored by against San Antonio in this early season.@jacked_daniel @SpursNationCP The history of the NBA cannot be told without the San Antonio Spurs tied to it. .4 and '13 Finals game 6 are daggers in our hearts,but NBA history none the less. #PORVIDAAfter lunch, we had a slight line shift that is worth getting into. 📈

It's in the second half of TNT's San Antonio Spurs 🆚 Los Angeles Clippers.

@sloprules spotted the opportunity, so he'll take it from here. Make sure to thank him.

GL if tailing 🍻DeRozan seems much more energized and happy now that he’s not in San Antonio. I was a HUGE fan of him leaving the team, I’ll own that. I think it was just time for him and the Spurs to go separate ways. But I’m happy to see him flourish in Chicago, better fit for his game there.Check out NBA LockerVision to see what the  are wearing against the San Antonio Spurs On Tue, Nov 16 2021
 https://t.co/IlvtNpbDePThe San Antonio Spurs could win 10 more championships in the next 40 years but yet would probably get the same amount of media recognition that they do now. At least in the NFL all the teams get some recognition, but not in the NBA.
