Sure, having the Lakers in Los Angeles doesn’t make a ton of sense, but at least they aren’t the ‘Guardians’. https://t.co/rxVwrD6tR3NBA Basketball Game Betting Picks Simulator: 3/31/2022 10:00 PM ET - Los Angeles Lakers vs. Utah Jazz - YOU CAN RUN THE GAME SIMULATION FOR FREE HERE: https://t.co/eQh379NE4g #nba #sportsbetting #freepicks #cappertekLakers back in the playin game 😏😏😏 #Lakers #LakersNation #LosAngelesLakers #LakeShow #NBA https://t.co/lbNbjUfLr8LeBron James will miss Lakers' game in Utah tomorrow because of ank...

Injuries, bad chemistry is all part of that. The Knicks are a disaster and have been for 28 years. But that wasn’t the question.“It’s only taken a year and a half for the Los Angeles Lakers to go from champs to chumps, from winning a championship in the bubble to losing in the first round last year and possibly missing playoffs completely this year.” — @LakerTom https://t.co/Ac4JIAbQf1@flipman65 The Los Angeles Lakers are now back IN the play-in game 👀 🔥Keldon Johnson missed the winning layup for the Spurs 😳

The Los Angeles Lakers are now back IN the play-in game! https://t.co/pZm1bveCftThe Los Angeles Lakers are back in the play-in.Spurs lose as Keldon Johnson's layup rims out 😅

The Los Angeles Lakers are now back IN the play-in game https://t.co/GjephhskD8hot take: the los angeles lakers are not winning the nba championship this yearOh wow, Keldon Johnson had a point-blank layup that somehow rolled out and the Grizzlies defeat the Spurs 112-111.

The Lakers now tentatively move 0.5 games ahead of the Spurs for the 10-seed in the West. Los Angeles is in Utah tomorrow without LeBron and AD.Ay y’all watching winning time: the rise of the Los angeles lakersToday, the Miami Heat became the first team in the #NBA Eastern Conference to clinch a playoff spot.

The Los Angeles Lakers sit at the 11-seed in the Western Conference. Looming.

2019: 37-45, missed playoffs
2020: 52-19, won title
2021: 42-30, lost 1st round vs PHX
2022: 31-44, currently outside the playoffs/play-in

I point all of this out to say: in 4 years, the Lakers might just play 3 playoff games in Los Angeles.@Glenjr1988 @KingJames Since LeBron still wants to live in Los Angeles and the Lakers management and fans don't want him, I think the Clippers should try to get him. LeBron with Paul George a match made in championship heaven. Watcha think Jeff?????Wolves have lost 17 straight games in Toronto. 

MIN, Longest Road Losing Streaks in One City

17 -- Toronto ('04-present)
