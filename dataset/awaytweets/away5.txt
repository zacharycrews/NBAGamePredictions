#DCAboveAllWashington Wizards (33.5). Over. I actually think this team got better. Russ was pretty bad for them for a lot of last season that put them into a hole that, admittedly, Russ then dug them out of. I think they replaced him with guys who are more consistently conducive to winning.🏀Bradley Beal and Russell Westbrook generated some headlines in Washington last season, but things should be a little quieter for the Wizards this season. @SteveMerril thinks that's a good thing as Washington stays under the #NBA radar.
