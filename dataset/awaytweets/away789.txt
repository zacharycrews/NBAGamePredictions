Not everyone has that channel as a part of their channel lineup
When my best friends @GrizzOnBally are unable to broadcast a game, it becomes blacked out locally on #NBAtv 
Most cases, must pay extra for that service 

Nonetheless, #GoGrizz #GrzNxtGen@jackruyg @GrizzliesPR @memgrizz @OrlandoMagic especially vs the Magic.@GrizzliesPR @memgrizz @OrlandoMagic I believe this is the same foot that he hurt in the Cavs game. Take no chances. Let him rest.So, I had this thread 2 years ago comparing the @memgrizz against the Thunder and Warriors who had similar great runs of draft picks. Grizz have absolutely crushed the draft since 2018. Don’t think they’ll win it this year, but I think they are a title contender next season. https://t.co/xQ2WKW5m40@kelwright I don't consider @NBATV a national broadcast like the @ESPNNBA or @NBAonTNT 

But for those that do get the channel/option it's good to know a broader audience will get to see @memgrizz #basketball
