Will gets a great matchup Vs a banged up Spurs team. San Antonio has given up the most points to opposing SGs over the L2 weeks. He has hit line in 5/L6 Games. Last time these 2 teams played, Will scored 19.Although the play-in tournament is a near lock, the Pelicans need to keep winning, including against the Kings tonight.

Hosting that first postseason game rather than likely needing to travel to San Antonio to face the Spurs is a really big deal. https://t.co/WPDQfqU3vl https://t.co/yiDvbD8WYO🚨 Line Change 🚨
