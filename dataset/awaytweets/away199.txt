The other name likely to draw big interest is Harrison Barnes and to a smaller extent Buddy Hield.

They should hand the keys to Tyrese Halliburton, Richaun Holmes and Davion Mitchell.Live pregame, in-game and postgame updates on tonight’s NBA game between the Sacramento Kings and Detroit Pistons. https://t.co/d8Qif0xXgPLive pregame, in-game and postgame updates on tonight’s NBA game between the Sacramento Kings and Detroit Pistons. https://t.co/BwIX6o0PH4Live pregame, in-game and postgame updates on tonight’s NBA game between the Sacramento Kings and Detroit Pistons. https://t.co/2OyxfvbFUcNBA Day 2️⃣8️⃣ 🏀🏀🏀

So humbled &amp; honored to see him featured in this @StocktonKings video. Where can folks buy a “#35 STOCKTON” jersey? Heck, if Marvin doesn’t want to play in #Sacramento, the new #35 for the @SacramentoKings needs to be Christian Terrell. https://t.co/7xD0YCXX5q#NBA

But I’ll go with what Shawn Michaels once said, “You make the rules and we'll break 'em! Yeah!"Check this out. There’s a lot riding on tomorrows game. @DetroitPistons @SacramentoKings https://t.co/X74LOTFoRh@becthegr8 @partyapebc @khemistry33 @SacramentoKings I love @partyapebcI need the Haliburton Draft suit (or something very similar). @SacramentoKings @TyHaliburton22 @GRAYSCALEIC https://t.co/fAtwJav97aAnd I look at Sacramento, who have been on the brink of losing the Kings many times over the years. Yet they're still there. And they don't even have the rich winning history that the Sonics had in Seattle that spans generations.
I wasn't alive for Wilkens but I seen theSports Conspiracy: The Sacramento Kings should've been the 2002 NBA Champions but Stern and company didn't like small market Sacramento getting in the way of a Los Angeles Lakers three-peat.27. Houston: Texans, Rockets, Astros
28. Minnesota: Vikings, Timberwolves, Twins
29. Sacramento/LA: Raiders??, Kings, Angels
30. Detroit: Lions, Pistons, Tigers@mynil4ever @SacramentoKings @ChargeCLE This is awesome!@slamsonette @StocktonKings @SacramentoKings Too funny!!@MrKenRudulphTV @Buccaneers @SacramentoKings You.    Gotta.

I've said for a few years now that among their shortcomings, the @SacramentoKings are just a collection of guys. A team whose best players would be the third or fourth option on most perennial playoff contenders. https://t.co/yN1xEBetey via @sactownroyaltySacramento Kings haven't made the playoffs since the 2005-06 season... you think they'll finally make it back this season??@jkubatko @SacramentoKings @buddyhield Had Steph not entered the league and popularized 3-point shooting, I doubt this record would come to exist.@RayAlmeidaJr @Buccaneers @SacramentoKings Exactly!! 👊🏿😁Fact of the Day: Jason Williams played for the Memphis Grizzlies longer than he played for the Sacramento Kings. https://t.co/zLR0vmFOoCBleacher Report said the Los Angeles Lakers should trade for this Sacramento Kings guard.  https://t.co/uE6M9JRfbBSacramento’s G League affiliate Stockton had a 51-48 halftime lead over Agua Caliente, then were out-scored 39-9 in the 3rd quarter by the Clippers. Stockton stomped in the home opener tonight 103-82.

No one will ever know the pain like I do.@MrKenRudulphTV @Buccaneers @SacramentoKings I live near Boston I’m a casual nba fan big Celtics fan but to see the kings win that would be appointment viewing!! Think Cubs and Red Sox it ultimately happened!!
…and Brady always had a game like this in New England every year means nothing in the big pic@becthegr8 @partyapebc @khemistry33 @SacramentoKings Gd to see Party Apes are everywhere around the World!!! https://t.co/XxNlW3BgIb
