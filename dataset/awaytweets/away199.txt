The other name likely to draw big interest is Harrison Barnes and to a smaller extent Buddy Hield.

They should hand the keys to Tyrese Halliburton, Richaun Holmes and Davion Mitchell.Live pregame, in-game and postgame updates on tonight‚Äôs NBA game between the Sacramento Kings and Detroit Pistons. https://t.co/d8Qif0xXgPLive pregame, in-game and postgame updates on tonight‚Äôs NBA game between the Sacramento Kings and Detroit Pistons. https://t.co/BwIX6o0PH4Live pregame, in-game and postgame updates on tonight‚Äôs NBA game between the Sacramento Kings and Detroit Pistons. https://t.co/2OyxfvbFUcNBA Day 2Ô∏è‚É£8Ô∏è‚É£ üèÄüèÄüèÄ

Yet they're still there. And they don't even have the rich winning history that the Sonics had in Seattle that spans generations.
I wasn't alive for Wilkens but I seen theSports Conspiracy: The Sacramento Kings should've been the 2002 NBA Champions but Stern and company didn't like small market Sacramento getting in the way of a Los Angeles Lakers three-peat.27. Houston: Texans, Rockets, Astros
