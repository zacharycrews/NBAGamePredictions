But, my point is that this is a two way street. Why weren’t the Charlotte Hornets/Bobcats a black eye when they went on a 10 year tank job? They went 7-59 to try and get the top pick. If he were talking about the small market Spurs I’d understand. https://t.co/ppDMskhzltEveryday I wake up proud of the Charlotte hornets for not paying Kemba a max contract.  All that “he’s a star and you mite not be able to replace his so just pay him” narrative never sat right with me… if that “star” is some mid, let him walk,The Chicago Bulls and The Charlotte Hornets are the No. 1 and No. 2 seeds in the East.
