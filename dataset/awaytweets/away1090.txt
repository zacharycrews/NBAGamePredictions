@HoustonRockets üöÄThe Mavericks are 3-0 versus Houston this season, but they will be missing superstar guard Luka Doncic on Wednesday. For the Rockets, Christian Wood enters with strong momentum.  https://t.co/DE8NIFOBTN@abbyeddymom @d2derrick @cdhthegreat @asoukuptx @alanshow @MorpheusDeZion @SportsDean @wash77033 @IamWendums @SammyDpsi @HoustonRockets @alperennsengun he has an unconventional style of playin the position that is different from other traditional PGs...I'm not saying he's careless w the ball, but he sometimes lacks the sense of urgency that you see in guys like CP3 or other PGs that really push the pace &amp; get in their sets quickRemember when @HoustonRockets Twitter only had one Question we were really asking‚Ä¶ ‚Äúwhat yo one‚Äôs look like?‚Äù I miss those days@MorpheusDeZion @cdhthegreat @asoukuptx @rocktredblood @alanshow @d2derrick @SportsDean @wash77033 @IamWendums @SammyDpsi @HoustonRockets @alperennsengun Lol most of the bigs in the league didnt come in shooting 3's i would rather have a big that knows how to work on the block and get better at the 3.

Can‚Äôt be objective. This was set in Texas City, a refinery suburb of Houston not 15 minutes from where I grew up. I know versions of all of these characters.
