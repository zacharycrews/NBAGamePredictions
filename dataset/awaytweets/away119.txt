Utah come into this one with a 6-1 record against a Hawks team on the second night of a back to back with a 4-4 record. Spida is questionable but I think he will play and if he doesn't I still like Utah's spot in this one.

All the best from Jazzland, Georges. You're a good dude too. 🙂💜💛@Callmewhite12 Yea of course. This game should go down to the wire of course. But the Utah Jazz are one of the best teams in the NBA. I believe their defensive efforts will help push them to a win. They’re 2-1 on the road thus far. If they shutdown Trae Young, it’s curtains for ATL.1u Utah Jazz +1 (-110) MGM

Not much science here. We know both teams are defensively oriented. Though, ATL will be playing a back to back and will have to travel from Brooklyn to Atlanta in the am.
