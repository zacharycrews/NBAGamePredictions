To get in their heads all you have to do is explain " I have 6 fouls and best believe they will hurt.I been waiting on dude bring him up @DetroitPistons https://t.co/tQwqrlTvoD@NBAgiam And the Jazz beat the Detroit Pistons at home by a few points 🤗🤗🤗🤗Detroit Pistons center Kelly Olynyk joins Jerami Grant in NBA health and safety protocols https://t.co/iOK9VzdKYV https://t.co/6xEimoESMj@ProPistons @DetroitPistons Word. Salley, JYD, Uncle Cliffy, Mehmut Okur, Corliss Williams, Terry Mills immediately come to mind@sigg20 Yep, the Detroit Pistons, and more prominently remembered as, New York Knickerbockers,’ great power forward (#22), was also, a professional baseball player too!!!@tinkertell5 @ASopaFlores714 @Sebistian321 @haiti4eva @kendrick_burner @yaboybryanp2g0 @fattpiss @Ballislife How did he not@have any weaknesses if he could never overcome prime teams@like the Celtics and Detroit Pistons?? It was clear he had weaknesses. He led the league in missed FG’s 7 time. He shot the ball too much and didn’t make his team better. Pippen confirms this.Detroit #Pistons center Kelly Olynyk joins Jerami Grant in #NBA health and safety protocols https://t.co/geDUYGpbbu@PistonFanInIndy @ProPistons @DetroitPistons That moment was crushing.I’m a #BadBoy like Detroit PistonLykes has been trash tonight until that pass but in any other game half his turnovers would have been foul shots. They have let aggies play like the detroit piston bad boys tonight.@ReubenR80027912 @DetroitPistons To be fair, everyone but Michiganders and their mothers hated the Bad Boys.  On the other hand, it’s always Detroit versus everybody so… https://t.co/IWVBQM4XEo@emilbltn @rocc_da_luxx @DomTheLakerStan I haven’t heard Jerami Grant express any desire to leave the Detroit Pistons.
Just Laker related rumors.I don't know, but I think you just designed my sports den wallpaper! @tigers @lions @DetroitRedWings @DetroitPistons https://t.co/EKKOifZhVW@houtz They certainly don't.

Cory Joseph’s revenge: Kings collapse over final 2:10 in loss to lowly Detroit Pistons https://t.co/MNtgGxgH8Q@WMDubitsky @DetroitPistons Yeah I mean fair

But every kid in China in the 90s idolized Mike

Detroit prob wouldn’t even be a top 100 metro by population in China

So, regards to Isaiah Thomas but, Jordan take the crown@ProPistons @DetroitPistons I remember when they lost to SA in game 7 he just sat on the bench with his jersey and stuff on forever after the game ended….I felt so bad for him. He’s one of my favorite Pistons ever.@socoastro1 @MotorCityBanter Why do Rockets fans dislike Cade so much? It's not like Cade said Houston is a trash city or anything like that. Jalen Green was the one talking shit about Detroit all because he didn't go #1, that's why Pistons fans don't care for Green.@DBteej @CadeCunningham_ @DetroitPistons @Pistons_PR @OaklandWBBall Thanks man! 🤞🏽It's a good thing the Bad Boys @DetroitPistons didn't have @Twitter   @Bucks https://t.co/UkU6TrH364【Stock information】CHAMPION "DETROIT PISTONS 33 HILL" BASKET TANK / EMERALD GREEN / https://t.co/ZWTUdPTi8y@Eminem @DetroitPistons @BleacherReport @mitchell_ness wow I love that jersey.Detroit Pistons center Kelly Olynyk joins Jerami Grant in NBA health and safety protocols https://t.co/BnAF0Tm9qY@ProPistons @DetroitPistons I amazed when I found out Detroit wasn’t even his prime years.
