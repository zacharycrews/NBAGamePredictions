That still has a way to go to become a platform for families with disabilities.  Moda &amp; The Trail Blazers could partner w OR Medicaid waiver programs and local tech to innovate in this space.

Sensory rooms are valuable,  but they are not an option for the many families experiencing  self-injurious &amp; aggressive behaviors that make outings impossible. Let's look for solutions that include everyone.@CloudStrife2021 @trailblazers Good memories, buddy.@abbylynneickert @Dame_Lillard @trailblazers @PinwheelEmpire @BlazersArgento That’s beautiful@keldotlauren @trailblazers Oh boySad that I can’t see @Dame_Lillard play tmm in BK, but let’s gooo @trailblazers !!!! #RipCity@Joeingles7 @trailblazers @ModaCenter what's up J.Ingles
