His veteran leadership &amp; toughness might be something this Chicago team covets.

But it's also next tuesday.There are a number of questions for the Chicago Bulls:

- Does Jerami Grant push you over the top?
- Are you going to pay him his next deal?
- Is he going to be a focal part of the offense?

Theoretically, it makes sense but Grant has made his desires public
