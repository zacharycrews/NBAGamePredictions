Duren is such a good fit for both Detroit and OKC. I think he'll likely be picked in the top five. But I think if Pistons pick Hardy he's going to form one of the deadliest duos with Cade in 3-4 years from now.

#LEGENDoftheMiamiHEAT #NBA75@RP3natural @KendrickPerkins @stephenasmith But understand that IT and the pistons had to play dirty against Jordan to stop them. Lesson learned: don’t be negative trying to be somebody cuz your mind will only be narrow as you can go. You see how Jordan overcame the Jordan Rules against Detroit and beat them 🤷🏾‍♂️ won a ring#MIAvsDET

#LEGENDoftheMiamiHEAT #NBA75Cade Cunningham is a baller for how young he is in the NBA 🔥 @DetroitPistons #Pistons #NBATwitter@EB_Asbr @Aj_Kimp Bruh… The Detroit Pistons only game plan against Mike was to physically abuse him and his team. Literally. You don’t know what you’re talking about. They had no choice. He was scoring at will. Literally. Drop 40 like it’s nothin. Keep quiet#MIAvsDET

This is the real Luka 😂@DetroitPistons @BallySportsDET @LukaG_55 OKAY DETROIT GET THE HEATI feel like if the @DetroitPistons get one or 2 good veterans this team could really go places. I love e way they play. They don’t give up easily. They got grit.@DetroitPistons @BallySportsDET @LukaG_55 Whait a minute.
What did I say a few days ago ???
https://t.co/MZHkQ0G5uX@DetroitPistons @BallySportsDET @LukaG_55 Best Luka in the league@DetroitPistons @JeramiGrant @SaddiqBey @LukaG_55 Jimmy shot 1 more FT then our whole team. We’re shooting over 45% which is very solid. They just got a few more points off TO or this lead would be over double digits. Really happy w/ our play, just gotta hold it. Did they take away 2 when they changed 3 to 2? #pistons@DetroitPistons @LCArena_Detroit @JalenRose Petition to make @JalenRose out next representative on Draft Lottery. I think he and Ben brings the same luck. They love the city and team so much. #Pistons@DetroitPistons @BallySportsDET @LukaG_55 Gotta step up on luka@DetroitPistons @LCArena_Detroit @JalenRose Detroit native that's our boy Jalen@DetroitPistons @LCArena_Detroit @JalenRose Is Cade hurt??@SGG_hq And facing Detroit Pistons https://t.co/ZJSa87zOiw@MiamiHEAT for some reason we seem to shit the bed vs lesser teams @DetroitPistons are way at the bottom do not lose to them, play like they are top 1-5 team. https://t.co/1zsx0yvsWz@DetroitPistons #pistonsplaylist P.diddy - badboys for life@DetroitPistons @LCArena_Detroit @JalenRose start winning games pleaseI thought that comeback win vs sorry @DetroitPistons was supposed to be "Turning point" for @Lakers ? Looks like they turned back to trash so far.. #NBA

Garza is much better than Stewart and Lyles. He is stronger, he is a better defender a he can shoot for three. He HAS TO receive more minutes. Wasting his talent would be a crime !!!@DetroitPistons @JeramiGrant @SaddiqBey @LukaG_55 Garzilla has arrivedGreat 1st half nephew #SaddiqBey @DetroitPistons https://t.co/mz4ZIs107uThe MJ worship is so crazy from the older generation man the Detroit Pistons none of those dudes feared him , the Knicks did not fear him, MJ even got in fights with own teammates that did not FEAR him…..and yes and Brons super prime he was ABSOLUTELY feared lol https://t.co/pNrTzq6aZU@DetroitPistons @Buddhablee @Cheurlin1788 Happy Birthday NBA World Champ!Heat come out tired and soft in the second half we going to lose by double digits to the DETROIT PISTONS! #HeatCulture

#miamiheat #heatnation #miami #heatculture #letsgoheat #miavsdet #detroit #pistons #DetroitBasketball #michigan #themitten #nba #motown #southflorida #fortlauderdale #bocaraton #westpalmbeachGreat first half for the #Pistons! Luka &amp; Cojo both played well, the defense was strong, they are majorly out hustling the Heat and the ball movement has been some of the best I've seen by Detroit all season.Detroit Pistons use to whoop MJ ass fucc is u talm bout Stephen A. ?? https://t.co/WbD1vR2WsvHeat have to do a better job of running Pistons off the 3-point line next half. The half isn’t over and Detroit’s taken 24 trays.I want him to succeed with the @DetroitPistons so bad #GoBlue https://t.co/kn9rUPldoJ@DetroitPistons @BallySportsDET @hamidoudiallo Elite finisher 😤Pistons getting to the rim way too easily.

Bad defense at the point of the attack is leading to Detroit creating rim pressure at will.
