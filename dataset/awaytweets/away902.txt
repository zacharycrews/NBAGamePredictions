I’m an A’s fan though bc I love misery and the Nationals weren’t a team when I grew upCavs win tonight in a close game that no one really expects. I mean Wizards are tired from a double OT game, but I think Cleveland even with Garland out is better than Washington.Cleveland Cavaliers vs. Washington Wizards gamethread https://t.co/SPkpWj3Dn5 https://t.co/Mkz5Jd7KLp#Washington #Wizards: This family thought they were ...

Wizards coming off an exhausting 2OT game vs. Spurs last night, so tired legs for today. Washington’s leading rebounder is Kyle Kuzma, so Allen should feast.

The dynamic 6’6” Canadian wing is the ‘mystery box’ of the class w/ his lack of playing time but the upside he provides is a rare commodity this late into the lottery and it’s worth a swing on https://t.co/105gy06LdmI dislike the Sato signing. 

I dislike trading for KP. 

I dislike giving Beal a supermax.

This should be too much points against Cavs without Garland, LeVert and Rondo… they are 4-2 without Garland this season and all of the wins was by 7 points or less. I dont mind they are terrible at covering on the road. Good luck who tails🙏🏼🔥Every single thing the Washington Wizards do is with the aim to simple “make” the playoffs at any cost. From now. Until infinity.

If he stays on this pace,

He'll pass Malone in 12 games on Mar 19, 2022 against the Washington Wizards.
