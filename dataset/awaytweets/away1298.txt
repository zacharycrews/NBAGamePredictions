@JaMorant is an amazing player but he was injured prior to and @Not_Poole didn't end his season. Don't buy the hype. If the @warriors end them tonight it is well earned, considering they haven't played well yet?!?

#DontHateRewatching Game 4 of the Memphis Grizzlies versus the Golden State Warriors, our energy and execution to start games is disconcerting.

Perhaps I am rooting for the wrong team because this has always been ingrained in the Stephen Curry-led Warriors' DNA, but we are so sloppy.@KungFuVampire @warriors Bad ass! ( not that I want you to miss the play but there's a few apps you can watch the game on free )@warriors So the fans just be choosing not to wear the shirts or what?I’m missing the @warriors game tonight and Muay Thai practice but guess what, I could care less, my daughter is in her first big play as The voice of Oz and Miss Gulch in The Wizard Of Oz. 

I’m one happy and proud dad! https://t.co/zQIuboaccj@warriors don't take us to game 6 .Close em out @Warriors.@JaMorant has been a difference maker in this series but he missed game 4 and looks likely to miss more time in. Can @memgrizz slow the @warriors and push them to a game 6 and 7?

It was the last of seven straight postseason games in which Thompson made at least five 3P, the longest such streak in NBA history. https://t.co/4dmZpMEwrm@warriors Take your 30pt. piece easy.

🇺🇸 NBA
💥Memphis Grizzlies vs Golden State Warriors:
Memphis win + overtime 👉@ 2.53 https://t.co/y0fpFb4gUd@FindPeace777 @stephenasmith @warriors You’re only lookin at stats. You don’t know basketball if you don’t realize how much dray does for that team@tccandler @takeuchi_ryoma @StephenCurry30 @warriors @NBA Tahar is just gorgeous.That boy Jamie had the damn Golden State Warriors Hamptons Five lineup with this string https://t.co/HQgd7R5Fwj@zaclay13 @stephenasmith @warriors Really not sure why you say that.....Green avg more turnovers per game than points.@NBA @Bucks @celtics @warriors @memgrizz What is this question for real 😳Despite what was arguably one of the most poorly played Warriors games in the Steph-Klay-Draymond era, they emerged victorious over the Grizzlies in Game 4. 

Can Golden State win Game 5 and make it back to the Conference Finals? (@trulyitbemax)

This will help the player to hv fresh legs thus there will be more goals in football. For coach, we can see more tactical from them.@boodog4849 I didn't think of that, he was wearing Golden State Warriors shorts@warriors Yes please. More like that. 💙🥳💛@TheJustAFan NFL - Cincinnati Bengals

Don’t really keep up with baseball too much anymore, but I loved Albert Pujols when I was a kid, so 🤷🏻‍♂️@Influxhealth @stephenasmith @warriors Definitely not a Memphis or Suns fan..... not sure what mean by ball handling....every player on every NBA can bring the ball up the court and make a pass.  Green's defense is pretty good unless the refs call a foul on him and then he goes beserk@KendrickPerkins that dog barking you did wasn't for phoenix suns it was for Memphis so stop jumping bandwagons just bcoz you wanna see @warriors lose...  #firsttake @stephenasmith@gummadi @warriors oh i haven't thought about that. based on the performance from game 4 i am not too confident for next two rounds tbh@Scoington @stephenasmith @warriors no other team in the NBA has a player that makes $25mil and just sets a screen and passes the ball.

However, Golden State’s experience says it all.@warriors Stop wearing black at home court, wear white or yellow/gold instead. Also the gold blooded shirts are trash, replace it with yellow/gold.

#GoldBlooded@MysticFoxDemon @PabzTetzSantos @DetectiveDick3 @GrizzliesPR @memgrizz @warriors @JaMorant Now you are changing narrative. No one ever calls out Kerr is dirty.
Your coach is now well known irresponsible, so are his fans.@The_DocHolliday @BiBigGuy911 @C_Anderson_99 @GSWReddit @warriors No grown adult could have looked at that play and seen Poole somehow creating a postseason ending injury.

Grab your knee like that and try to give yourself that kind of injury. Get someone else to try.

You can't do it. It never made any sense.@warriors I think the #Warriors should just takeout  the Memphis Grizzlies and Shut it All Down Today  even if Ja is claiming A return, JA Should go down... Go #Warriors 🏀 🔥🚒💧🌊💧🌊💧🌊@The_DocHolliday @warriors You were so gullible that you ran with the idea that Jordan Poole could have actually damaged someone’s knee with a three finger swipe.   Even though there was footage of the obvious knee bump and Ja limping after that play, yet you still posted the false accusations. Smfh.The Golden State Warriors could clinch the second-round series against the Memphis Grizzlies with a win in Game 5 of the #NBAPlayoffs on Wednesday night.

Jenkins was gaslighting everyone from the moment he had the post game interview. Hold that coach and team accountable.@Matjebons @MaxXL63706847 @Liam28SD @stephenasmith @warriors It would require the game to stop too often. You would have to put timeouts. I think American sports stop too much and are over coached. No need to Americanize football. Add more subs would work.@marvp0411 @The_DocHolliday @warriors I’m talking about the fans mostly. Warriors Twitter is out of control@JohnGPettus @The_DocHolliday @warriors Here’s the thing, John. Basketball is an INSANELY fast-paced game…yes Brooks made an unsafe play on GPII and it resulted in an awful injury. However, to say Brooks made up his mind that he was gonna injure him, is insane. It’s the postseason and everybody plays incredibly hard@emmegraphic_ @Nike @warriors @nikebasketball @StephenCurry30 Great work!

Here is my Lanier moment in 1995 as a @warriors assistant. @KPIXtv @Bucks @DetroitPistons #BobLanier https://t.co/nKfpZVekmK@GrizzliesPR @memgrizz @warriors Let us hope we can all be adults tomorrow… Nobody boo Jordan Poole and nobody boo Dillon Brooks… that would be nice.@Rashid_LE @warriors Ja is out for the rest of the season mexa?@kiDKAZiNOVa @MiamiHEAT @Bucks @warriors @Suns @NBAonTNT Wow way to really step out there with a risky prediction 🤦‍♂️@JJBlood_ @warriors @NBA @memgrizz @JaMorant Definitely should be a suspension@warriors Y’all wanna know why Poole fits in so well?  Because those brothers splash!@ananavarro @MiamiHEAT @jaketapper I’m from the SF Bay Area, so go Golden State Warriors!@COLORmeKIMBERLY @The_DocHolliday @warriors This is the video that proof Ja was injured himself when crashing Klay Thompson. It was not Poole. https://t.co/aOebUUlVwd@The_DocHolliday @warriors Poole should never have been accused of dirty play in the 1st place. Apologies would not be necessary.@warriors Unanimous MVP and went 73-9 surely he got a ring for all of this@warriors Yall better put Jordan in the graphic next time@The_DocHolliday @warriors Going off that bozo coach of yours loooll@warriors Golden state Floppers@warriors Retweet to vote for #GaryPaytonII as this season's #NBACommunityAssist Award winner💚🎉RIP Bob Lanier. He was under Nellie’s coaching staff and was the interim Head Coach for the Golden State @warriors 🙏 https://t.co/7P1UqSEMvB@The_DocHolliday @warriors The problem is you seeing that video and actually thinking Poole injured his knee in the first place.A mind-boggling comeback from @warriors in Game 4 🔥 against @memgrizz . Hope to seal the series in the coming game 5 ⚡🥳.

#gswvsmem@The_DocHolliday @warriors lame attempt at an apology.....you need to have your eyes checked@GregLeeKTVU @ScottCelestre @CamCleve2 @warriors @ChaseCenter Thats some Awesome Love...
 Good moveIts gonna be hard to beat teams like the @Bucks, @Suns, @warriors and @MiamiHEAT's without a @KingJames or @KDTrey5 on your roster.🤔 https://t.co/huEbHwbhhvIt seems like the Golden State Warriors are going to win the 2022 NBA Championship.  Good luck to all of you NBA teams.@JonathanEJaime @stephenasmith @warriors @Money23Green It was one game in a series of 7 and they're up 3-1.  They won the ugly game.  Oh the manufacturned drama is ri-DICK-ulous.@stephenasmith @warriors Don’t watch em no more@COLORmeKIMBERLY @LiamOCo30659250 @The_DocHolliday @warriors Lmao intentions? Come on now 😂😂😂😂. You think anyone trying to break your bone would merely touch your knee?In fact, he only played on two contenders: the 1983 and 1984 Bucks, both of which made the East Finals. Imagine if Detroit had actually supported him. But, he stayed classy. He was a good guy.

He was later interim head coach of the Golden State Warriors when I was 5 years old.Go dub @warriors@The_DocHolliday @warriors Respect for being a man. As a GSW fan we good wish your teams Coach could man up!  Wish Ja didn’t get hurt tho cause this series was shaping up to be epic@The_DocHolliday @warriors Respect@Taffer27 @BookerOfDevin1 @warriors Don't touch him.he is blind@BBQueen1999 @stephenasmith @warriors He said in the Kerr era, just pointing out there were games where the Warriors were trash on offense.@The_DocHolliday @warriors Takes a real man to admit when you are wrong. I knew Poole couldn’t have hurt him anyway you look at that video.  Ja just knew he was hurt and blamed Poole. Warriors in 5.@warriors @StephenCurry30 Awesome@BookerOfDevin1 @warriors bane stepped on Curry's right foot I think I should give away  a clear glass for you.Looks like we're halfway there in the Conference semi-finals, and all eyes are on the Phoenix Suns, the Golden State Warriors, and the Miami Heat.

That's the difference between Minnesota and Golden State. Warriors are closers, Wolves are not@stephenasmith @warriors This is the way it rolls in sports.

All you gotta do is look at the ball. You'll see the slowdown, which is brief, but effective at painting Poole as dirty.@nuggetsfannn @warriors they already saved me@nationsgr8test @The_DocHolliday @warriors Bless your heart.Mannnn, @dallasmavs vs @warriors is going to be a boring Western Conference Finals 😴👎 https://t.co/Gz8R8TnSY4@COLORmeKIMBERLY @The_DocHolliday @warriors That clip has been altered. If you look at the ball right before Poole 'reaches' for Ja's knee, you'll see that the clip slows down for a brief moment. What that does is make it seem like Poole pauses for a bit before making a decision to grab Ja's knee.

Just watch the ball fr@zay_irl @LiamOCo30659250 @The_DocHolliday @warriors Let’s not throw insults sweetie! We don’t know each other, and you better be glad!

Period!@warriors This team is op@The_DocHolliday @warriors Look at the first reach, JPs knee, bumps into the side of Ja's knee. Afterwards, JP grabbed the knee.

Jenkins/Morant lied.@jby209 @warriors Salute!Jordan Poole's tug on Ja Morant's knee looked potentially dangerous, if unintentional. But ... how did it result in a bone bruise?

@memgrizz @warriors@CParkerrr @warriors Hahaha! Appreciate it!@ILove_theArts @warriors I never said he didn't grab his knee. I know he grabbed his knee but that doesn't give you a knee bruise.
