His rotation choices have been rife with favoritism not consistent with his own "philosophy" of effort and execution, which has led to early playoff exits

@utahjazz | #TakeNote https://t.co/elibwrWx2ADepleted Utah Jazz offer signs of hope in loss to Toronto Raptors ‚Äì NBA News https://t.co/csLVRvyyax@Wainright_Szn @uknowwsp @utahjazz Joy is in the journey my friend. If your only satisfaction is Toronto getting rings, then ya best start laying low for a while. I‚Äôll come find you when/if the raptors become relevant‚Ä¶ or when all the All-Stars that stand in their way of the chip get hurt again.A look back at the performances of Elijah Hughes, Danuel House, Jared Butler and the rest of the young @utahjazz roster.

Plus, a preview of tonight‚Äôs game against the @pacers which resulted in four ejections the last time these teams met.

https://t.co/Xokv29k6jF@ideaoneup [Fixed].
Takeaways: Quin is a great coach [if you ignore that he has played favorites and not rewarded hard-working bench to enforce performance]. Elijah and Eric need more minutes and Jared isn‚Äôt quite there yet but he‚Äôs going to get there. This game was a fun watch.

Eric Paschall put 17 on you in the quarter. 

He's averaging 3.2 points per game this season on 42.2 percent from the floor and 29.3% from three.

Nice effort.Whatta shot!! Dang!! #utahjazz https://t.co/6aXCyLR2xp@NBA @utahjazz So embarrassing as a Raptors fan. Awful quarter from the boys.This 1q was the most fun Jazz basketball ever!

Mitchell, Conley, Gay, Clarkson, Bogdanovic, and O'Neale are out due to injury or rest.@UtahJazz_France Jared butler met 25 pts tranquilleAfter  brief delay eight Utah Jazz players have taken the floor for pre-game warm-ups, so I guess we have quarem. Hassan Whiteside -- who was questionable -- jogs in and does the Hulk Hogan "I can't hear you" to the empty seats, so points for that.@Dadderson1 @nickcrowton4 @utahjazz Not true. Canada can't forcefully keep an American citizen out of America.Here's who is available tonight for the Utah Jazz in Toronto.

Total of 9 players. Was very close to this game getting postponed. #WeTheNorth 

AVAILABLE:
Hassan Whiteside
Trent Forrest
Eric Paschall
Jared Butler
Malik Fitts
Danuel House
Udoka Azubuike
Norvel Pelle
