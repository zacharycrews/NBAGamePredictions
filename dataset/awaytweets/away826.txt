Rich Paul (former vintage jersey salesman) beats out Adam Silver (Duke University &amp; Chicago Law School) and Darryl Morey (Northwestern &amp; MIT) to win the day.Ben Simmons gonna be upset when he finds out that the nets are 10 feet in Brooklyn too@MikeCraigMC @RyJetNet @RealCodyMallory Brooklyn Nets was number one team in the east because of KD. He has been carrying the team despite Harden was struggling to play after the injury. 
Man has been leading the NBA in turnovers. 
I don't feel bad he left but I hate how he quit on the team midseason.The Nets re-tooled around Kevin Durant, plugged some very obvious holes in the roster and kept their flexibility for future trades. 

Here are my takeaways from the James Harden trade, where Sean Marks turned a lose-lose scenario into a win for Brooklyn.

https://t.co/FjzvuWD1G5I am so excited for the future 30 for 30 on the KD era Brooklyn NetsBrooklyn nets getting together the last quarter of the season, building chemistry and knocking James harden out the playoffs would be poetic justiceIt makes sense for Simmons to go to the New Jersey Nets of Brooklyn because they don't have any fans that could boo him.Excited to see @Loveandfarewell in the @BrooklynNets tunnelü§é https://t.co/ZuhHc77zKBSimmons going to the @BrooklynNets makes nothing but sense! KD and Kyrie (when he plays) take a whole lotta shots‚Ä¶. And since we all know Ben won‚Äôt shoot the ball‚Ä¶. It makes all the sense in the world.@NT215_ @JamieApody @espn @sixers @BrooklynNets We know.

Just locked themselves in as the favorite to win the East over the Bucks@BrooklynNets new mascot #NBATradeDeadline #Trades https://t.co/QV9IE7t5K7The Nets entered Thursday as the favorites to win it all at +400 (or an implied 20% chance).

However, after trading James Harden, the Nets' odds dropped to +500 (or an implied 16.7% chance).

Brooklyn now has the same title odds as the Suns and Warriors: https://t.co/nCDFg2jMuq@BrooklynNets Who‚Äôs KD taking with his first pick? @luka7doncic? @Giannis_An34?@BrooklynNets @24_camthomas @blakegriffin23 can ben play today or nahI reiterate, the Cleveland Cavaliers won the trade between Houston and Brooklyn that saw James Harden become a Nets player.

#NetsWorld 

(Sai)I cannot believe y‚Äôall made this trade. @BrooklynNetsThe Philadelphia 76ers have acquired sharp-shooting guard and former NBA Most Valuable Player James Harden from the reeling Brooklyn Nets as part of a blockbuster trade, ESPN reports. https://t.co/wwCABeNCz9@CurryPeace @BrooklynNets @24_camthomas @blakegriffin23 Shirt link https://t.co/5UhQvS1Xw4Believe it or not the @BrooklynNets won in this trade but still fuck @KyrieIrvingThe "Beard" is heading to Philly...James Harden traded to 76'ers.

I guess the Sixers just wanted to a vet with Championship experience like Harden and the rings he won in OKC, Houston, and Brooklyn, where he was totally a team player and not a team cancer.  ü§îBen Simmons is going to flourish in Brooklyn. He doesn‚Äôt need to shoot when you have snipers all over the floor. His ability to get to basket will put enough pressure on rams.

This was a win/win for both teams. The Nets get Ben Seth and Drummond. The Nets are stacked and Ben will THRIVE in Brooklyn. THRIVE. Best perimeter defender and focus on D and playmaking while KD and Kyrie score. The Nets can win it all.@BrooklynNets finally got a center!!!

But we ended up getting four first round picks and the rights to 4 swaps from brooklyn who may be back in the lottery soon.

This was a good move for every team involved but the nets.Nets received 1 year and a half of Harden, who was traded today for Ben Simmons, Seth curry, Andre Drummond and two first round picks 

The big loser of this trade in hindsight is Brooklyn, they gave so many picks for a injury riddled season of harden, and now Ben Simmons. https://t.co/tfmXm5pas8@BrooklynNets 
Say what you will, but James Harden tried to make it work for the Nets Harden was disillusioned with Kyrie Irving, get the shot, don't get the shot drama.

He was a hot commodity for autographs back then.

I had him sign this Brooklyn Nets hat, and sure enough, just over seven years later, he gets traded there today.

Am I a futurist? I think so. https://t.co/3XmVGGI0V3Following the Brooklyn-Philadelphia trade that sent James Harden to the 76ers, the Nets are still favored to win both the Eastern Conference (+210) and the NBA Championship this season.

And now MIL got IBLOCKA - REPEATSimmons can get stops, which improves #BrooklynNets defense (a big weakness). They also get 2 veterans &amp; 2 1st round picks.

#NBATradeDeadline #NBAMan, that NBA trade reminded me of the time I transferred to another store to help a manager only the manager transferred again making me look like a jackass. Hang in there @BrooklynNets. üòÇThe @BrooklynNets and @Sixers trade may seem lob-sided to many but I think it‚Äôll workout better for the Philly. They‚Äôre basically going all for this season with @JoelEmbiid having an MVP type year. #NBATwitterLive@BrooklynNets now trade kyrie for dameGreat trade!! @joetsai1999 @BrooklynNets@Lytze8 @BrooklynNets Harden wanted out sadly. When he want to get out of a team, he‚Äôs immediately becomes the worse player than kyrie and Ben combined..Brooklyn Nets fans can finally stop trying to convince themselves that we need to keep a quitter on our team, that shit was disgusting all week.@htrain5 @JSunDoubleU @Andre19392655 @sixers @BrooklynNets @WashWizards Plus they had a player who refused to play for them.

LMFAOO@BrandoLightShed @BrooklynNets @sixers Exactly...@BiruhA2416 @BrooklynNets @sixers When you think about it Sixers gave Seth, Andre &amp; the picks for Harden. Ben wasn't playing so it doesn't feel like they are losing him. 

But still Nets got him which will help a lot. He will make a huge difference. 

If these two meet with full team my money will be on the Nets.James Harden‚Äôs trade from the Nets to the 76ers carries potentially large implications for the future first-round draft assets from Brooklyn that are headed to Houston over the next six years.  https://t.co/ypoy1HJbEeIs this the worst time to say all my Brooklyn Nets merch has James Harden name and number on it üòëüòÖ #JamesHarden @BrooklynNets@Jarvish87593839 @AllenRobinson @BrooklynNets L. we got harden without giving up maxey or thybulle. we got rid of a player who refused to play all season and the fanbase hated.Give it to brooklyn nets now!Non't agree w the crowd that says the @BrooklynNets big three of KD/Harden/Kyrie was a failure/fraud. Injuries &amp; personal decisions due to COVID stopped this team from being great. Their record when healthy was near flawless. Not a fraud, they're a HUGE question mark‚ùì#NetsWorld@DFSMAFIA99 @BrooklynNets @sixers Time will tell.

The @BrooklynNets are ACTIVELY going to try to avoid having Home Court Advantage at ANY POINT in the #NBA Playoffs. First time ever that Home Court would be a DISADVANTAGE for a team due to Kyrie.

@Rjeff24The fact that Brooklyn gets Seth as well is huge. The Nets definitely come out on top in this deal. https://t.co/EJP5Rt4YlyThe NBA trade deadline is almost here, and the Brooklyn Nets and the Philadelphia 76ers have reportedly made an enormous splash.

If this trade doesn't yield a Kyrie extension and a corresponding championship, there will be hell to pay.

@FrankDangelo23 https://t.co/CoZataoLz1In January 2021, the Brooklyn Nets traded for James Harden to complete this superstar trio:

‚ú® Kevin Durant 
‚ú® James Harden 
‚ú® Kyrie Irving 

Over a year later they had managed to play just 16 out of a possible 113 games together.

It wasn't meant to be. 

üòû https://t.co/XHpKqL3dyHSource: @NYCMayor has agreed to pass a law that makes sure @BrooklynNets fans and sports media don't look at him, make fun of him or ever talk about @BenSimmons25 in any manner ever to not risk making him mad #NBATradeDeadline@mcapri27 @NBA @BrooklynNets It's crazy. The Nets were screwed by that nut job Kyrie. Harden was abused and overworked cuz Kyrie couldn't/wouldn't play. They spent so much on getting these 3 together, there was nothing left for the role players. All to have them together for 16 games in under 2 years.The Ben Simmons trade standoff with the Philadelphia 76ers- the ugliest in NBA history- is finally over. üèÄ
Simmons to the @BrooklynNets to join fellow Aussie @Patty_Mills while James Harden is heading to the @sixers to team up with @JoelEmbiid.

So Ben went from being an embarrassment in philly to now all of a sudden a game changer in Brooklyn? Y‚Äôall wanted Morey to do something and he did it!!We got 22 minutes @BrooklynNets go get him keep the picks and Send Blake Griffin instead lol https://t.co/xNftr6sPkZBen Simmons a Brooklyn Net so Maya Jama bout to be at the games.

Hello 911 ‚òéÔ∏è 

I‚Äôd like to report a crimeI think the Brooklyn Nets just won the championship.Nets easily.

Simmons is a way better fit in Brooklyn than Harden ever was. He's gonna be a monster.

Add Seth on top? This isn't even close. https://t.co/kaHpht5kQZHey @BrooklynNets... Y'all happy y'all getting Simmons?? Because Philly thanks u for taking him.

If Harden doesn‚Äôt work out after next season the sixers have enough money to go out and get a star player to put next to Embid.@DFSMAFIA99 @MikeBlakeney4 @BrooklynNets @sixers And Brooklyn got a useless playoff player.

Whats corny is being able to dish it out and then turning sensitive when u get it back.@thatskinnykid_ The nets didn‚Äôt even win this trade. Simmons is only bringing defense to brooklyn and maybe the ability to stretch the floor for shooters like curry and Harris. Durant needs to stay healthy and with kyrie only playing part time, the nets would be lucky to have a play in spot.The Brooklyn Nets got a a great deal!

‚Ä¢ The most star power in the NBA, maybe ever.

‚Ä¢ The deepest roster in the league.

‚Ä¢ The best backcourt in the league.

‚Ä¢ The best shooting in the league.

‚Ä¢ The arguable best player in the league.

‚Ä¢ Five competitive big men.

Zero holes. https://t.co/Z52gUZhQayCongrats @BrooklynNets you got probably the biggest bitch in the league in simmons. But good luck to Drummond and curry they‚Äôre great pieces to haveSIMMONS TO BROOKLYN !!!! THEY NEEDED DEFENSE !!!! #NBA #nets@Mike_umlilo I think its good for both parties . 76 get james . And the nets get ben, cury some nigga n 2 1st round picks. Ben ‚Äòs weakness is shooting thats not a problem in Brooklyn . Embiid will get a dominant guardSixers starting lineup -Embiid, Harden, Tobias Harris, Danny Green and Tyrese Maxey
Nets starting lineup has Kyrie, Curry, Simmons, Durant and LaMarcus Aldridge/Drummond or Blake Griffin
Brooklyn Nets won this trade while still noting Kyrie will miss games
https://t.co/GjxyOCXiLF@EvanRobertsWFAN you are in your ELEMENT. .I am so happy for you I agree with you..WHAT IF BEN SIMMONS AWAKENS AND SCORES 50 AGAINST HIS OLD TEAM..THE 76ERS O.M.G..so happy for the Brooklyn NETS and @EvanRobertsWFAN ..I hope you enjoy the games now that James Harden is gone..@atmos_usa The @BrooklynNets big timeI love the trade! @BrooklynNets üî•üî•Where would the Brooklyn Nets be with the butterfly effect if KD didn't step on the line against the Bucks in the playoffs?@ceddyb_ @BrooklynNets You right .. when we played them he was slapping our shit all overBrooklyn Nets trade James Harden to Philadelphia 76ers for Ben Simmons, Seth Curry, Andre Drummond https://t.co/GMwu4iMFoR https://t.co/e7Fg6UZicOThe @BrooklynNets BIG 3 of Harden-Irving-Durant played only 16 games and to be clear... this has been the lowest number of games that any trio from all @NBA teams in history. That's a crazy fact

#NBA75Ben Simmons with all that fire power around him the nets will be a problem. He doesn‚Äôt have to score and he plays defense which will help Brooklyn out. His game fits well. Plus the lane won‚Äôt be closed up they don‚Äôt really post anyone.@RyanMattiza @TheHoopCentral @statline_ @sixers @BrooklynNets Eh..

Nets gained a big man that we need got 2 first round picks and harden out of shape and old.The Brooklyn Nets had the best big 3 in the league by far and fell apart because of stubbornness to get a vaccine. UnrealThe Brooklyn Nets and Philadelphia 76ers are finalizing trade sending James Harden for Ben Simmons, Seth Curry and draft picks, sources tell @TheAthletic @Stadium. :¬†nba https://t.co/szgmUGUv16here comes the angry harden fans saying nets fans didn‚Äôt care about harden if they‚Äôre so happy to acquire simmonsü§° he clearly didn‚Äôt care about brooklyn so why keep someone who scores 4 points when the team desperately needed him, and wanted to leave. nets needed size as well.Woj Bomb. üí£ 

James Harden goin to da 76ers.

Da Brooklyn Nets have been more dysfunctional ova da past few season than my New Yawk Knicks. https://t.co/SbsGEk6nd2@BrooklynNets get Ben Simmons some Tims ü•æ@THENATUREBOY1 ‚ÄúThe pressure of New York,‚Äù certainly does not apply to the Brooklyn Nets.Good riddance Ben! @sixers @BrooklynNetsThe mega deal with the Brooklyn Nets and Philadelphia 76ers is complete. The Nets are trading James Harden to the 76ers for Ben Simmons, Seth Curry, Andre Drummond and two first-round picks, per @wojespn.@ANDREMCMILLON @BrooklynNets Bro what about the away games they gotta play in the playoffs?Idk how to feel bout harden on the 6rs‚Ä¶ #nba #BrooklynNets@wojespn may I offer someone to y‚Äôall @BrooklynNets https://t.co/y0sdgqOHCBCan we just say that the best thing ever would be if we got home court over the @BrooklynNets in playoffs as it will FORCE @BenSimmons25 to have to play potentially 4 games in #Philly .  Lol.  @TyJohnsonNews @MikeMiss25 #SixersThe only thing that MIGHT rescue the Nets now is the NY mandates being lifted. 

But as long as Kyrie‚Äôs a part timer, Miami and Milwaukee are the threats in the East. Brooklyn traded themselves into the mid-tier todayWow what a fucking trade the Brooklyn nets just pulled off Thts insane they are now easily favorites to win the championship especially if kyrie figures things out and is able to play every single game these playoffs they going all the wayAs a Brooklyn Nets fan I‚Äôm disappointedKevin Durant is gone from the Nets. 

Sorry Brooklyn.The Brooklyn Nets got better today.Dang, the @BrooklynNets robbed the @sixers is broad daylight. They must have something on Daryl Mirey. Got a shooter, big man, and a ball handler/wing defender and two 1st round for a ball hog. But if they don't raise a banner at the end of the year it's a failure.Yo time out‚Ä¶Brooklyn got TWO‚Ä¶TWO 1st rounders in this trade + Drummond, Seth, and Ben. üòÇüòÇ the Nets fleeced em lmfaoI can't wait for Durant to come back and put the whole league on notice again. The Nets are still winning it all an this trade is just a bump in the road to get there #BrooklynNetsSeeing nets fans talking themselves into 'simmo the savage' is hilariously relatable.

"He's young"
"His defence"
"Things are different this time"@FieldYates James Harden forced his way out of Houston for that Brooklyn Nets super team and it still wasn't good enougn! Fair or unfair I still wish Harden the best of luck in Philadelphia. I'm not going to hate on Harden, but my friends were right and I was wrong for always defending him.@Tr00pRespecter @wojespn @cavs @BrooklynNets Didnt comment on the trade. Commented on the fact he didn't want to go to the team a request a trade. If they would've kept him they would've lost him for nothing, but even still after the fact I would much rather have Allen and LeVert over Simmons.I'm not sure how I feel yet, about this #BrooklynNets #76ers trade...

We get some interesting assets, but lose Harden... But Harden hasnt been playing like Harden...

So torn about this.So James Harden has now forced his way out of OKC, Houston and Brooklyn. Sixers get him, but surrender Seth Curry and two 1st round picks. Nets? They now have two head-cases in starting lineup with Simmons And Kyrie. One hasn‚Äôt played this season; the other is a part-time player.If the right Simmons shows up in Brooklyn ‚Ä¶ look out.

But what‚Äôs on paper isn‚Äôt as easily translated to the court ‚Ä¶ 

Will rostering both Kyrie &amp; Ben Simmons haunt the Nets?ok @BrooklynNets this is too much. Can't root for Simmons. Don't really care about the picks. 

...come at me @OldTakesExposedBrooklyn Nets has the best roaster in the @NBA #Nets@JamieApody @espn @sixers @BrooklynNets Thoughts‚Ä¶people forget what Ben Simmons brings to the table because he wasn‚Äôt playing.

Best player in the deal is Harden.  And he will be able to run pick and roll with Embiid.  Deadly.  They did give up a lot losing Simmons, Curry and the draft picks.  Drummond was just depth.I feel that the Brooklyn Nets had to shake things up considering how things were going. With the James Harden trade today, they got Ben Simmons, Seth Curry &amp; Andre Drummond.

I think the Nets needed to get rid of Harden, while receiving respectable players back in return.Brooklyn Nets still winning the championship with Ben Simmons?Ben Simmons adds nothing but defense and play initiation to the Nets.

I think that's BS! #NBAIf Ben Simmons has a Brooklyn Nets jersey in the @NBASTORE before Demar Derozan has a Chicago Bulls jersey available my head might explode https://t.co/ovW1NspDuLBrooklyn Nets üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•Announcing that I have also been traded to the Brooklyn Nets for James HardenI feel like Seth Curry is a big loss for the Sixers, and then it's a nice gain for the Nets. He's real shifty off the bounce and can get his own shot. Ben Simmons could boost his career in Brooklyn https://t.co/XriMUwVxEyA @Sixers vs @BrooklynNets matchup in the playoffs would be INSANE!

It‚Äôs going to be electric in Wells Fargo. Get the popcorn üçø https://t.co/xC5pGbonLtSeth curry going to Brooklyn? Yoooo I feel the nets won this trade https://t.co/8LuhggKcU7We will take it @BrooklynNets https://t.co/9HyGrl9QGiBEFORE I AM A BROOKLYN NETS FAN I AM A TINASHE FANImagine the Brooklyn Nets are in the playoffs and they are in game 7, a home game against philly ECF. Then the day before it comes down to Kyrie getting vaccinated if they want to go to the championship.@TheHoopCentral @statline_ All depends if @sixers win a chip in the next 2 years, if not then @BrooklynNets wonI feel like a healthy Durant plus Simmons makes the Nets a better team. Plus they got Seth Curry. Both teams get what they want but I have a suspicion this works out better for Brooklyn. Can‚Äôt trust the Harden/Morey combo to win when it matters.Lmao james harden getting traded to the 76ers hahaha ü§£‚Ä¶. What happened to the Brooklyn nets super team?? #76ers #NBAThat Nets &amp; Sixers trade gonna get talked about for decades. That‚Äôs crazy. Brooklyn really didn‚Äôt do anything with that team.It appears to be that the trade between the Brooklyn Nets and the Philadelphia 76ers is not official.Brooklyn Nets Big 3 Super Team?!?!?!i can't lie. ben Simmons is mad lame to me. üëéüèø

he better show the fuzz OUT w/ the @BrooklynNets.Operation Buy A Championship 2.0 for the @BrooklynNets. https://t.co/5pzXfWCs0jSo from the HOU perspective: This deal certainly helps THIS year's Brooklyn pick value. Simmons not ready yet, so good chance they blow up this year. Long term though? Depends how you feel about Simmons. Personally I think the Nets are going to be solid at worst for a bitSeriously @BrooklynNets what am I supposed to do with these? Open to any ideas. @CoreyBCantor @NetsDaily https://t.co/xujQfscfr0LMAO Brooklyn Nets window slammed shut after 1 season.Ayeee we still kept patty mills too üòÇ #BrooklynNetsCrazy this actually happened, but I like it for both teams. Sixers get the superstar they've been holding out for. Nets recoup some cost, get assets Philly would've had to spend to sign Harden outright. Embiid/Harden pairing will be nasty. Simmons an interesting fit in Brooklyn.Everything about this #trade works in the #BrooklynNets favor. 

-You solidify a decent center with #Drummond
-get another high caliber shooter in #Curry
-receive the best wing defender in the league in #Simmons 

First impressions: BKN won this deal. Easily.

#NBATradeDeadline@TyriceWalkerJr @BrooklynNets Nash Kyrie and HardenHonestly, the #Nets and #Sixers both won this trade. Brooklyn gets a defensive stalwart surrounded by shooters. Philly becomes a true championship contender.Nets won that trade bad unless Philly wins the chip this year.

#BrooklynNets 
#NBA@JamieApody @espn @sixers @BrooklynNets Not happy about Seth or Andre but if they win a championship I will for meet the entire thing! Would have parted with green, shake, or naing before the other two but we shall see!Seems like the 76ers let the Nets off the hook.

If you let a pissed off Harden stay in Brooklyn, that situation just gets worse.

Instead you just let them improve their team and now have to go through them (and MIL) in the playoffs.BREAKING | The James Harden era in Brooklyn has come to an end. 

The trade ends a weeks-long entanglement between Harden, the Nets and the 76ers and positions both franchises for drastically different futures. @krisplashed https://t.co/LQhoGcOmvU#Nets
The whole process of James Harden coming to the Brooklyn Nets was a Ploy by the GM of Philadelphia to rid the Nets a star players in Allen and Levert

Damn.Half the timeline is saying the 76ers are gonna run through the East now. Other half is saying it'll be Brooklyn.

That right there feels like a win for both.

Harden doesn‚Äôt accept the importance of loyalty into a person‚Äôs character. Maybe he‚Äôll win a championship, he will not have earned it.@BrooklynNets you shittin‚Äô me? https://t.co/o6tAAc4uDlRT brooklynsbeat: Patty Mills knows harden quit on #nets. When he told us harden looked fine in practice despite harden being out with ‚Äúin‚Ä¶ #BrooklynNetsI think a lineup of Kyrie, Joe Harris, Ben, KD, Aldridge/Blake would be solid. Seth and Shake coming off the bench too. @BrooklynNets y‚Äôall don‚Äôt need Maxey, Thybulle or Drummond.Shouldn't the Brooklyn Nets first ensure that Ben Simmons won't pass up on another dunk?Aye @BrooklynNets the Bucks are tooling up to kick yo ass again‚Ä¶get KD some help dammitCrazy that just 11 months ago, James Harden was getting some consideration as league MVP after his first two months as a Brooklyn Net.

A lot has obviously happened since then, but it‚Äôs surprising there‚Äôs a good amount of people who truly believe he‚Äôs finished as an elite player. https://t.co/mH4StPiKmdSources: James Harden has REFUSED to play for the Brooklyn Nets if not traded at the deadline.

Go and trade for a player who quit twice for a player who quit once?Do something @sixers @BrooklynNets@NoCapD_ @BrooklynNets Ben would play if he‚Äôs traded. Ben also defended Trae very well especially game 7. Held him to under 40% fg and 32% 3pt fg for the series. Imagine if they don‚Äôt have Ben, they lose in 5.

What do they know that we don‚Äôt?If there is a Sixers/Nets trade today, there‚Äôs no way in hell it‚Äôll just involve Philly and Brooklyn.

Brooklyn #Nets has leverage and philadelphia has to make a significant offer and come strong if they want this deal to get done

#NetsWorld@BrooklynNets trade Harden alreadyMy crazy take: Why don't the Lakers trade #Westbrook, #THT, Dwight and another piece to Brooklyn... for #KyrieIrving and a young piece or two? Ky can be a full time player in LA and the old OKC boys reunite in #Brooklyn. #NBATradeDeadline #LeGM #Lakers #Nets #JamesHarden #NBA@JPO___2 @JDumasReports Brooklyn can send him wherever the hell they choose. If Philly wanna sign Harden in FA they‚Äôd better move Simmons and others by 3pm AND take back expiring deals. No way that happens. They have to deal with the Nets or no Harden.NBA Game Preview:¬†The Washington Wizards have a forecast 64% chance to win against The Brooklyn Nets with a spread of -2.5/2.5 and an over/under of 226. The Washington Wizards are 0 - 2 against The Brooklyn Nets in the 2021-22 Season.

And as any fan of 1990s comedies knows, that means only one thing - GET HIM OUTTA HERE!Less than 4 hours ... give us something @wojespn @BrooklynNets@ShannonSharpe @undisputed Is it wrong to talk about the mental toughness of the superstar players on the Brooklyn Nets? And of Ben Simmons? It seems like everything gets in the way of these guys being able play high-level basketball.

I added Patty instead of Bruce cuz i thought nets had too many PGs but if Kyrie isn't playing then might as well keep Patty.

@sixers @BrooklynNetsThe relationship with James Harden has already been damaged. The Brooklyn Nets have no choice but to trade him.@RealJonBee @BeccaMVP Can‚Äôt blame Russell Westbrook, gotta blame Lebron James for recruiting Westbrook. Didn‚Äôt need a BIG NAME PLAYER to try and keep up with the Brooklyn Nets Big-3. Lakers needed to trade for a 3-point specialist = floor spacer.@BrooklynNets It makes sense....trade him.I am super optimistic, they won't be able to pull the trade and @JHarden13 sill be a @BrooklynNets when I wake up tomorrow morning!

I‚Äôve heard too many good Nets jokes in the last 24 hours and I know they have more!!!!@BrooklynNets Cavs fan here, just want to say thank you for LeVert &amp; Jarret Allen#freeharden and #freebensimmons

Time for the @BrooklynNets and @sixers to execute this trade and keep it moving. No point holding on anymore https://t.co/ldMy5hJzwR@BrooklynNets announce the trade already!!!!Because James Harden doesn't want to be Brooklyn Net, here are your morning links: Starbucks in NYC are seeking to unionize, Oscars won't require vaccines, White House staff believe Trump clogged toilets flushing documents, skateboarding bulldog, and more. https://t.co/NW2pAc4DhB@Du_ragsToRiches @BrooklynNets Take Russ and DJ back PLZ!!!@BrooklynNets , only a little worried.Given everything that has happened, if the Brooklyn Nets can only get Ben Simmons and minimal assets for James Harden‚Ä¶ should they make the trade??James harden wants out of Brooklyn to the 76ers.
The nets are asking for Ben Simmons‚Äôs and 2 or 3 players in return more to comeI would trade 5 BrooklynNets players for Russ rn üòÇüòÇ@BrooklynNets Let Nash leave the coaching team, and the probability of winning the championship of the basketball net increases significantlyÔºåtrust meBron at least taking his lumps over the head until the deadline lol lol the lakers worst than the nets lol cause everybody there and healthy and it just doesn‚Äôt work . We don‚Äôt even know what Brooklyn looks like w all 3 guys playing lol!That's the way things go in this business.  Talk talk talk talk and then go a different direction at the end. 

I would not be surprised if the #Nets found a way to move #Kyrie to the #Knicks.

And I would not be surprised if #Ben is traded somewhere besides Brooklyn.

The Brooklyn Nets would like a trade package of Ben Simmons, Seth Curry, Matisse Thybulle and Andre Drummond https://t.co/X4f7WYHkifThe thing that sucks the most is that the @BrooklynNets traded LeVert and Allen, two homegrown hard working guys.

James Harden quit on KEVIN DURANT when he was hurt for ONE month

Pathetic@BrooklynNets trade harden for WestbrookJames Harden clearly wants to come to Philly. 

The Brooklyn Nets should absolutely trade him for this elite player.  
https://t.co/Etw3w4MCk7@JordanHousman1 @BrooklynNets the nets are deep fried bahd. and only downhill from here is the craziest part@Gregan_Sports How does Brooklyn have the leverage?

But if he's unhappy, he shouldn't be forced to stay. Then again, if I was him, I would give it one last try with Brooklyn and then do a sign and trade in the summer with Philly if still unhappy. I think he owes it to the Nets to try for a bit more.All the hype ‚Äòbout the Brooklyn Nets and look at them nowHarden camp has used his last leverage‚Ä¶ he went to Woj to get out of Brooklyn cus Woj was right, the Nets/76ers has had much talk about a trade so Harden camp starting apply pressure to get out of BrooklynMood all day waiting for that ‚ÄúThe Philadelphia 76ers are acquiring SG James Harden from the Brooklyn Nets in exchange‚Ä¶‚Äù https://t.co/d9tg29VsXuThe Washington Wizards take on the Brooklyn Nets on Thursday night üèÄ

It takes years to build a team. Look at the @warriors, @Suns and @Bucks: they invested in youngsters years ago to have the team they have now. https://t.co/p4HTlxzbI8I need it @BrooklynNets  do the deal@Lakers need to Trd Westbrook for Harden , good fit for both teams @BrooklynNets need a good tuff two way 3rd option and @Lakers need another scorer w/  @KingJames and ADThis makes a lot of sense the more you think about it ... narratives everywhere.

#LakerNation #BrooklynNets #LeBron #LeBronJames @Lakers @BrooklynNets https://t.co/SncMgVNERXHe definitely plans to exercise his player option and stay in Brooklyn long term, the @BrooklynNets clearly have leverage, the @sixers should trade Simmons, Maxey, Thybulle, and four firsts for him. https://t.co/6bX5ZTvNnuSleepy time, when I wake up Jevon Carter better be a starter on the Brooklyn NetsTwo part question:

What do you mean by ‚Äúdeeper than that‚Äù? 

At this point the @Lakers @nets @sixers need to trade:

@russwest44 to @sixers 
@JHarden13 to @Lakers 
@BenSimmons25 to @BrooklynNets 

#fuckit https://t.co/sh0bjwi4GdNBA Trade Rumors: Philadelphia 76ers will not include young guard in trade talks with the Brooklyn Nets barring a significant¬†change https://t.co/tTFuUdFkml@AKBLJS @Raptors @Bucks @BrooklynNets @MiamiHEAT @sixers @Pacers Again, i could be wrong and I'm 100% willing to listen to experts and/or good reasoning.

I get that the East is a crapshoot - Milwaukee is the only thing close to a sure thing, but I don't see the Raps making a deep run just by adding Myles Turner.@AKBLJS @Raptors @Bucks @BrooklynNets @MiamiHEAT @sixers @Pacers I like Myles Turner a lot - but he's injured for at least another month and the Raps would only control him until next season.

Not sure the Raps are one player away from title contention [this year for sure]@GregLogan1 I‚Äôm surprised James Harden is still a Brooklyn Net? Are you? What would you ask Philly for in a Harden deal?@DeedsWylie @Raptors @Bucks @BrooklynNets @MiamiHEAT @sixers @Pacers Maybe been out the ball game too long but thought Myles that guy@DrewAllarSZN Loyalty to Kobe held the franchise back a few years. They proceed to immediately sign the 2 worst contracts in the NBA. We lucked out in the lottery multiple times which prevented us from full blown becoming the Brooklyn Nets.LMFAOO DO THIS @Lakers @BrooklynNets @sixers https://t.co/VTUFVTxUD6Not sure I like this trade that much for the @Raptors - they take on a LOT of salary for two guys that won't put them over the top vs. @Bucks  @BrooklynNets or even @MiamiHEAT &amp; @sixers 

@Pacers get a LOT of assets + cap space.

But I'm willing to be convinced otherwise. https://t.co/EiriCRi5WkHas there ever been a time in the history of sport where a team has lost 9 consecutive matches  &amp; still remained the favourites to win the title ?

Via ESPNI really like Steve Nash as a head coach.
I really, really, really hope this Brooklyn Nets team is trying to lose to get him fired...
why would yall want a new coach ?
who would replace nash?
would that fix on court chemistry issues?

Although Nets head coach Steve Nash earlier denied reports that Harden would be traded, the star guard has become increasingly disgruntled in Brooklyn. 

READ: https://t.co/AxTrUnSaQH https://t.co/YiC8clMGdE@jeffrey_trainer @RealGM Nothing to say because you know I'm correct... Philly has ZERO leverage going into tomorrow unless they meet the Nets demands Brooklyn doesn't have to move him, cost will be lower come July but we still talking sign and trade unless Philly wants to unload picks for cap space@SAINTNET1 @BrooklynNets @SeanMarksNetsGM @SteveNash depends on matchups vs minutes, but agreeBrooklyn better take Ben and some picks and stop playing #Sixers #NetsI know I said I got closure @_bigjayy_ but this just made me miss the good ole @BrooklynNets days.

Trade deadline ends tomorrow at 3PM. @NBA@jeffrey_trainer @RealGM Let's start with losing him for nothing... Philly doesn't have 40 million in cap space without trading both Harris and Simmons without taking money back so no Nets don't have to take .50 cents on the dollar they can make that same deal come July Philly is desperate not BrooklynLastly: on the Philadelphia-side: I‚Äôve heard that in the Nets/76ers James Harden conversations discussed: 

Brooklyn wants Tyrese Maxey.

Philly is not willing to part ways.

#NBA #NBATwitter https://t.co/gAwply7GAISources: Trade talks between the Philadelphia 76ers and the Brooklyn Nets have ramped up surrounding All Star G James Harden. A deal is expected to be completed in the next hours, Ben Simmons is expected to be the cornerstone of the deal. https://t.co/vz61re3qYt#Celtics beat the #Nets to win their sixth straight and leapfrog Brooklyn in the standings https://t.co/OuU4qFcEQl@eeciaj @JBlevinsNBA Yup. They‚Äôre assuming he‚Äôs lying to the nets and the nets are lying publicly. As if harden didnt have a choice of where he preferred going back when he picked Brooklyn and he didn‚Äôt lie to Morey about where he preferred going back then#Celtics beat the #Nets to win their sixth straight and leapfrog Brooklyn in the standings https://t.co/I4zXa4Jw1bWhy can‚Äôt my sports teams have good reporting I just went through a literal circus with the @Jaguars HC serech were none of the important guys or local media people could be trusted. @BrooklynNets doing the same Bs.I trust WOJ but Sean marks might be using him for leverage trust0Remember last year when the Brooklyn nets were chillin before the trade deadline. No stress, no trade rumors, win streak with kai and harden. Everyone focused on winning. Every team trying to match our level. Man......it was only a year ago. Wow@TheHoopCentral @APOOCH If James Harden gets traded, then the rockets have took the Brooklyn Nets entire future.Do you think the Brooklyn Nets should still be the favorite to win the NBA finals this season?@dmorey @BenSimmons25 @SeanMarksNetsGM @JoelEmbiid @JHarden13 @sixers @BrooklynNets so what are we thinking here?Seems like Bruce, jevon, Johnson will remain Brooklyn nets for this season üò≠. Damn üòî@Dgriffii @dmorey @BrooklynNets @sixers Both trash. I‚Äôve had better in jersey lmaoooo. Absolute trashOn Thursday, the speculation came to a head when both players' agents confirmed the reports that the Philadelphia 76ers and Brooklyn Nets had agreed to a trade.Per sources:

The Brooklyn Nets have agreed to trade James Harden and Patty Mills to the Philadelphia 76ers in exchange for Ben Simmons, Seth Curry, and a future first-round pick.@TheHoopCentral @APOOCH Every one of these ‚Äúinsiders‚Äù, and Woj is good, don‚Äôt get me wrong but they all say ‚Äúanything can happen‚Äù, ‚Äúit‚Äôs fluid‚Äù which Woj used earlier, ‚Äúas of this moment‚Äù. It‚Äôs all a game where they can use, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm told it all came together when‚Ä¶‚Äù. #Sixers #Simmons #Harden #BrooklynNets@EvanRobertsWFAN really? @EvanRobertsWFAN those are the choices when it‚Äôs obv ketchup &amp; if it‚Äôs any mustard it has to be üçØ just saying ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è still love you bud gotta stick together as fellow @BrooklynNets fans but C‚Äômon! Lol üòÇ mayo or mustard haha ur too funny my friend. Carlos F from deer park.ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è@RTRSPodcast Has it been confirmed that noon tomorrow @dmorey #Sixers and @BrooklynNets are having a joint press conference?megastars together and letting them 'figure it out' is just lazy. Good teams are more than their superstars, they are made of the best pieces that work together. The @spurs and @Patriots proved it for years. Sad that the @Lakers and @BrooklynNets show how NOT to build a teamHope @sixers trade for @BrooklynNets @JHarden13. It downgrades both teams. He‚Äôs a bad teammate and is too broken down to make a positive impact. If trade happens, it puts @Bucks, @chicagobulls, and @MiamiHEAT on top in East. #BullsNation #SeeRed #NBA #NBATradeDeadline #NBATwitterThink again just look what kd did in last Playoffs  and you were  getting hurt if you and kyrie were in better condition you would definitely  win the championship
@JHarden13 
@BrooklynNets #NBA75@amelia__milo @barclayscenter @BrooklynNets That was so beautiful I had to follow you for more music https://t.co/z8n0YAfwBaBiggest Brooklyn Nets trade we gonna get before the deadline is Tristian Thompson üò≠At least this dude had the energy to type it out. I stop arguing when ever there is an insult for Ben Simmons as the player not person. Nets are greedy and majority  of Brooklyn fanbase is delusional not understanding the player they might receive https://t.co/WP36KKAmqH@BrooklynNets @CanonUSA As a Nets fan, im sold on trading harden for simmons. Dudes 6'11 and runs like a gazelle, 25ish years old, actually plays defense. Bring him to Brooklyn with green (cap reasons), thybulle, and a first.O harden e nets 
LOL
Don't do this
@JHarden13 
@BrooklynNets 
Both will repent
I love you  Harden but this decision to
Trade 50% of championship with KD
Playoffs mode
For Sixers
It's a jokeI can‚Äôt believe KD and the nets let Kyrie trick them. Crazy thing is Brooklyn can‚Äôt trade him cuz him and KD are a package dealI‚Äôm so glad @BrooklynNets have so much #toxicity@BrooklynNets Please don‚Äôt trade James for Ben‚Ä¶ He ain‚Äôt cut out for Philly, definitely not a Brooklyn type.Beginning of 2021-2022 NBA season :
Nets winning east
Lakers winning west
Nets VS Lakers final

As of now : Both are equally bad and sh*t
@ESPNNBA
@NBA
@Lakers
@BrooklynNets
@KingJames@Will_Fairbanks @zachzeaman And that if harden isn‚Äôt traded within 24 hours the nets will lose him without getting anything in return as he becomes a free agent and is openly wanting out of Brooklyn@BrooklynNets Ok lets make this happen @SeanMarksNetsGM 
And we bring a title to brooklyn
