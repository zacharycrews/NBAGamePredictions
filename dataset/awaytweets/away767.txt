Check out our trade chatter episode anywhere you stream podcasts https://t.co/qB4ALx9BTF@KMJeezy @corysparks i know that. i'm talking about the fact the name should've changed. Hell New Orleans gave Charlotte the Hornets name back when they got a new franchise. There's probably no more appropriate name than the New Orleans Jazz wasLet's go Celtics!!!
@celtics @hornets https://t.co/2YFUZMXn4A@RepTheDMV name should've stayed in New Orleans, same way Seattle still owns the rights to SuperSonics, Cleveland kept Browns and Baltimore became the Ravens and how Charlotte got the Hornets name back.@CPrice_504 i always said there should've been a three team swap when Charlotte got a new team. New Orleans get Jazz back, Charlotte got Hornets, and Utah gets a more Utah nameConsensus Line Move:

#NBA #espn #python #personalfinance@hatingkimani24 @QMDON1 @hornets And plenty of point guards are better shooters &amp; defenders than LaMelo. 

I said Holmes would be a better "fit" on the Hornets (with Ball) than Turner, and he also wouldn't demand a big contract in the near future. Turner takes too many 3s as it is, but I could live with either.Charlotte Hornets vs  Boston Celtics Prediction 2/2/22 - Free NBA Picks https://t.co/6AyVox5L2R via @YouTube
