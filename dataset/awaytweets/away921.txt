Go ahead and join a winning team like the Detroit Pistons@JohnnyKaneTV @DetroitPistons @NMAAHC Fitting way to end an outstanding celebration of #BlackHistoryMonth by the whole #Pistons org and the NBA.Today was powerful. The @DetroitPistons toured the @NMAAHC in Washington DC. To be able to experience the museum together makes their journey of growth and understanding that much more special for an incredible group of individuals. #Pistons https://t.co/njZJLOhjCE@itstru__ @VeveRich @__TheGale__ Detroit Pistons were called the ‚ÄúBad Boys‚Äù for a reason. Back when Rodman/The Worm was on the Pistons.
