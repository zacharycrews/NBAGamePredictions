Big Three-Game Road Trip for the Sacramento Kings - By Tom Witt https://t.co/Rtv1kCDewW@SacramentoKings Alvin called time out at 3 mins left in 4th quarter. It changed the momentum. Great call. 

However, he forgot to call another timeout ar the last 2 seconds before Fox went to FT.

The young talents need a cold-head supervisor.

If they want to rebuild with him they gotta do it quick@MarcosBreton @SacramentoKings @CarmichaelDave Lol. Marcos, Dave is a bad influence. üòÜ@celticreportNBA @SacramentoKings I like Fox but who cares if he asks out? It's isn't working now and he's been here five years. It's exactly the same thing that happened with Boogie. They missed the window to make it work which was when they fired Joerger. It's too late now and time to rinse and repeatbeen defending Marvin Bagley since he was drafted. he had a rough stint with injury and didn't find team chemistry because of that and terrible coaching. he's always been a high ceiling player. he'll keep getting better and better.

No one will ever do more emotion damage to me than the Sacramento Kings@SacramentoKings @thekingsherald @sacramentoproud. Fox while a good player and extremely positive human being, is not a franchise player. Kings need to get rid of him for whatever they can get while there‚Äôs some value. Yikes.@SacramentoKings @CoorsLight Horrible defensive effort.  Fox‚Ä¶dammit man!Hey @SacramentoKings and @NBA- ball don‚Äôt lie.

Kings are a disgrace to human life and sports. Please make a move or get the hell out of Sacramento. Pitiful pathetic embarrassing loss. Disgrace to sports. Piece of shit fucking team.WTFFFFF Cody Martin handed the Sacramento Kings the game on a silver platter and De'Aaron misses BOTH free throws to tie or take lead.. howwwwww sway... https://t.co/mnBgkkDtyqYou should not be in the conversation of being an all star if you cannot hit free throws when the game is on the line @swipathefox @SacramentoKings @mmcnair@SacramentoKings just lost a game they had no business losing. Starters are shaking hands with the Hornets and smiling. Not Bagley. He's upset and frustrated. I like @MB3FIVE@SacramentoKings @CoorsLight What happened to Charlotte lmaoaaaand the streak ends with 2 missed free throws from De‚ÄôAaron Fox and Kings lose by 1. Hurts to have the streak end, but all streaks do end. 

Sacramento Kings ML ‚ùåFox makes every FT during the game. Then down 1 he is on the FT line to win the game‚Ä¶and misses both. üòÇüòÇüòÇ sucks to be a @SacramentoKings fan!@SacramentoKings get rid of fox immediately.

Marvin Bagley records 7 pts and 5 rebs in 7min, having a insane plus minus of +17 in a very close game, and yet he only played this much in the first 22min of the game. If you don't wanna develop him, please trade him ASAP!
