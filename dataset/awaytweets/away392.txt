Big Three-Game Road Trip for the Sacramento Kings - By Tom Witt https://t.co/Rtv1kCDewW@SacramentoKings Alvin called time out at 3 mins left in 4th quarter. It changed the momentum. Great call. 

However, he forgot to call another timeout ar the last 2 seconds before Fox went to FT.

The young talents need a cold-head supervisor.

He's the highest-paid player on the Sacramento Kings this year making $28,103,500 per year. 

He should return a portion of his salary to the fans.

#TheGamePlan@MarcosBreton @SacramentoKings @CarmichaelDave Fox had a bad two shots. The Kings are approaching two bad decades. There is little room to put this in any context other than a legacy of horror.@SacramentoKings @swipathefox @mmcnair @AlvinGentry Just Sayin..
And btw there’s nothing to smile about after a loss when these are the only headlines you can see lately.. https://t.co/87VnWa0lMm@SacramentoKings @TerenceDavisJr 19 pts is still amazing, TD2! On to the next!@ChimanCornelius @SacramentoKings I agree there. Halliburton and Mitchell are decent pieces that they should hold onto, but Fox is already getting older. If they want to rebuild with him they gotta do it quick@MarcosBreton @SacramentoKings @CarmichaelDave Lol. Marcos, Dave is a bad influence. 😆@celticreportNBA @SacramentoKings I like Fox but who cares if he asks out? It's isn't working now and he's been here five years. It's exactly the same thing that happened with Boogie. They missed the window to make it work which was when they fired Joerger. It's too late now and time to rinse and repeatbeen defending Marvin Bagley since he was drafted. he had a rough stint with injury and didn't find team chemistry because of that and terrible coaching. he's always been a high ceiling player. he'll keep getting better and better.

They would not even have been in the game. You have something negative to say every friggin game. Hield and Bagley in the game at the end?

Beyond Fox and Davis, the Kings offense was unable to get anything going in the fourth.

Sacramento allowed 124 points.

Buddy Hield &amp; Harrison Barnes struggled to get their offense going.

Sacramento allowed 124 points.

https://t.co/vd4KmVHlDv https://t.co/x2XFnouvdSSacramento kings …. What have I done to deserve this ??😭😭😭I’m so over the Sacramento kings lmaoThat was theeeee most Sacramento Kings way to lose a game. I’m so glad i didn’t take off work and drive to Charlotte tonight. If i had seen that in person, i would’ve lost it! https://t.co/LkWoZGWznxI’m 90% sure I’ve tweeted this previously but it needs to be said again. No one will ever do more emotion damage to me than the Sacramento Kings@SacramentoKings @thekingsherald @sacramentoproud. Fox while a good player and extremely positive human being, is not a franchise player. Kings need to get rid of him for whatever they can get while there’s some value. Yikes.@SacramentoKings @CoorsLight Horrible defensive effort.  Fox…dammit man!Hey @SacramentoKings and @NBA- ball don’t lie. Fix your refsThis sums up what its like being a Sacramento Kings fan https://t.co/5V6UmQ72hsgoing to mute the words kings and sacramento for my own sanitySacramento should be embarrassed. The Hornets were missing half their roster &amp; the Kings were healthy.Successful challenge.. yet our last timeout is taken away from us ? Make that make sense

Kings are a disgrace to human life and sports. Please make a move or get the hell out of Sacramento. Pitiful pathetic embarrassing loss. Disgrace to sports. Piece of shit fucking team.WTFFFFF Cody Martin handed the Sacramento Kings the game on a silver platter and De'Aaron misses BOTH free throws to tie or take lead.. howwwwww sway... https://t.co/mnBgkkDtyqYou should not be in the conversation of being an all star if you cannot hit free throws when the game is on the line @swipathefox @SacramentoKings @mmcnair@SacramentoKings just lost a game they had no business losing. Starters are shaking hands with the Hornets and smiling. Not Bagley. He's upset and frustrated. I like @MB3FIVE@SacramentoKings @CoorsLight What happened to Charlotte lmaoaaaand the streak ends with 2 missed free throws from De’Aaron Fox and Kings lose by 1. Hurts to have the streak end, but all streaks do end. 

Sacramento Kings ML ❌Fox makes every FT during the game. Then down 1 he is on the FT line to win the game…and misses both. 😂😂😂 sucks to be a @SacramentoKings fan!@SacramentoKings get rid of fox immediately. Middle school players are better free throw shootersJust Sacramento Kings basketball for you https://t.co/USV3NOw8iz@SacramentoKings how the fuck did he miss those 2 free throws?De’Aaron Fox missing two free throws to lose the game is the most Sacramento Kings thing I’ve ever seen@SacramentoKings WE WERE DOWN 7 KEY PLAYERS YALL SOME FUCKIN BUMS KEEP TALKING HALIBITCHCharlotte Hornets stings Sacramento Kings 124-123 James Bouknight 24points 6rebounds 1assists.James Bouknight en la victoria frente a Sacramento Kings. https://t.co/j7s9Ogr0eHJesus!!!!!!! @SacramentoKings  SUCK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Sacramento Kings absolutely STINK.

Hes a joke@SlickG69 @hornets @SacramentoKings Thanks! I was leaning PHX, but I think I saw Ayton is out. That backs me off of it a bit.@NBA @SacramentoKings @hornets Give the MVP to Martin already!Too bad the Kings never had a close look at Cody Martin or any opportunity to bring him onto the Sacramento Kings. https://t.co/uw28m3i1N7@nbattack @hornets @SacramentoKings Eyeing anything on the Bos/Pho game?

https://t.co/R23CGByyAD@HornetsCharlote @SacramentoKings This game should be on a playground somewhere. The lack of effort on defense is an embarrassment to the game of basketball. Garbage!We're looking Nice guys @SacramentoKings#Charlotte Hornets - Sacramento Kings ★ #2º cuarto terminado: 69 - 71 ★ by: #SofaScoreI don’t care about Buddy’s points, his turnovers, shot selection, and awful defense aren’t worth it.  Move him for anything. #sacramentokingsLiterally know one playing defense lol #sacramentokingsI am so sick of Sacramento Kings. Marvin Bagley records 7 pts and 5 rebs in 7min, having a insane plus minus of +17 in a very close game, and yet he only played this much in the first 22min of the game. If you don't wanna develop him, please trade him ASAP!
