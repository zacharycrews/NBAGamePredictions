Utah Jazz 64%
Los Angeles Lakers 57%
Denver Nuggets 50%I did notice that Coach Q did not play Conley much one Jazz had hold the game last night. So I am not too surprised to see that Conley should play tonight against 76ers 

#JazzNation #UtahJazz #TakeNote https://t.co/jG3XzhjgdkMike Conley not on the Utah Jazz injury report on a back end of back to backInteresting tidbit from @utahjazz vs. @Timberwolves 

Gobert was a +25, but was only a +2 while KAT was on the court.

Last year he was a +2.3 vs the wolves, and a -1.7 when KAT was on the court.

The Jazz’s scheme works against most teams, but not KAT.No Mike Conley on the Utah Jazz injury report. He’s good to go for tonight

But not hated like the Lakers, who move ratings from folks watching to see them win or lose.

They're hated in a "Get ya ass off my TV and out of existence, because nobody outside ya polygamous ass City cares" type of hate.  

There's a difference.The Utah Jazz become the first team in NBA history to make at least 20 three-pointers in three straight games, as they beat Minnesota, 136-102. https://t.co/FZ3oKfwN9Y https://t.co/ibUqI9T7GY@utahjazz @spidadmitchell Shot of the year candidate @spidadmitchell don't you think so,bro...Utah Jazz’s forwards cosplay as centers as Wolves, hold their own in key stretch

#TakeNote x #RaisedByWolves@kslsports @utahjazz Patrick can claim whatever he wants his mouth and ego is bigger than his abilities@Masonfrfr @liuzziarius @DaneMooreNBA Ah gotcha, so the Jazz should put their 7’1 center on Curry, Lillard, DeRozan, Lebron etc.. going forward instead of what makes logical sense with their defensive scheme. I’ll pass this along to the Utah Jazz, I’m sure they’ll have a good laugh.GAME RECAP

The Wolves fall to the Utah Jazz 136-104 tonight. Another game where they just couldn’t defend the 3 ball giving up 25 3s on 46% shooting. 1st half was actually quite entertaining led by Ant and Pat Bev and KAT tried to follow it up in the 2nd half to no avail. https://t.co/JKKUlWtbE6@utahjazz What I see is let’s the ball roll, picks it up, but they generally give you a gather step to get your feet set. It’s all about when he picks the ball up with both hands.Y’all do this bullshit every season only to go out sad in the playoffs 

Just enjoy your team man. None of us care about the Utah Jazz and their swaggerless team and more swaggerless fanbase 💕 https://t.co/11qSv281hs🕷 @spidadmitchell cooks up a 36-PT performance for the @utahjazz in their huge road win! https://t.co/jpIv5Ps1iNDonovan Mitchell goes off against the Timberwolves to secure win for Jazz!

Jazz are now on a 5-game win streak! 🎷

#donovanmitchell #utahjazz #timberwolves #nba https://t.co/W4K83WPXGdNo team is loaded with 3pts shooters than the Utah Jazz, Charlotte Hornets close though.@DaneMooreNBA The @utahjazz defensive system clearly didn't work #Idiot #TeamGamePatrick Beverley claimed he deserved Defensive Player of the Year over Rudy Gobert despite losing to the @utahjazz by 32 points.

https://t.co/rYEZMQ2Opz@TwiterlessDave_ Understand if we get Ben I am a Utah Jazz fan lmao fuck the Celtics on god@utahjazz JC’s game is back 👌🏻📓 | The Jazz became the first team in NBA history to have three consecutive games with 20 or more made three-pointers.

#TakeNote@sportsiren @utahjazz @spidadmitchell He’s 100% class.Donovan Mitchell scored 36 points as the Utah Jazz extended their winning streak to five games with a 136-104 victory over the Minnesota Timberwolves.  #NBA75 https://t.co/WoHGnibJfNOnce again, In NBA, nobody scores more point than Utah Jazz. Nobody !!!!Game 7 of the NBA Finals. 

Utah Jazz down 2 with 1 second left, Donovan Mitchell heaves a full court shot toward the hoop except it’s 2 feet right of the hoop.

But what’s this? It hits an invisible obstacle hanging from the hoop and goes in? 

Utah Jazz win the chip in 7. https://t.co/TedxVln6Gy@TreMilli15 @OBtoojiveforyou Batmans don't grow on trees, there's like 5-6 of them in the NBA. The Wizards want to be like the Utah Jazz, that's the lane they're picking.The @utahjazz small lineup is working and Quin Snyder explained why. 

Plus, Patrick Beverley questioned Rudy Gobert's DPOY at halftime, then stunk to close the game. 

#TakeNote

We are tuned in with a evening cup of coffee.@utahjazz Feels like the opposite of the last two games, where we are actually getting much better looks overall, but the Wolves are just hitting shots. Gotta figure out how to rebound with Gobert on the bench though.@pzimny19 @WorldWideWob Definitely rigged for the Utah Jazz, as we've seen time and time again.

Do they even follow up on Utah Jazz stats?Donovan Mitchell is making it look really easy as he's got 17 first quarter points. 

But the @utahjazz need to find their defense as they lead the Wolves by just one, 34-33.
