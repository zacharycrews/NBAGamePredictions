#GamblingTwitter https://t.co/gLMvkf7vMnCeltics can be an adjective that implies a noun. Example: "Boston Celtics" meaning the people of Boston who are Celtic in nature.

When used as a movie title, Celtics, as an adjective, implies a noun. Show the noun in a 20 yr  tv series, don't spell it out.It’s time for Random Game Wednesday!

In our first RGW, we go back to 2004 to take a look at Doc Rivers’ first win with the Boston Celtics. Rivers coached Paul Pierce and a 36 year old Gary Payton to a BEATDOWN of Stephon Marbury’s Knicks.
