I have been advised that I should amend my previous characterization of the Lakers‚Äô finding a Westbrook trade from outright impossible to extremely unlikely. There is one team out there that would take him, if the conditions are right. That team, is the Houston Rockets.@marioelie1 @HoustonRockets Happy Birthday Hakeem Olajuwon!üêêüèÄTrade Brodie BACK to Houston ??

-Houston is 4-1 ATS in its last 5 games on the road

Warriors are on the second night of a back to back, and yesterday‚Äôs game went to overtime. Warriors will also be without Klay &amp; Draymond, so Rockets +11 looks like the best play https://t.co/MWhuhVfAeadear @HoustonRockets,

thank you@HoustonRockets @JalenGreen @Jaygup23 PLEASE dont trade for Westbrick!!@HoustonRockets @JalenGreen @Jaygup23 Let Jalen run the offense today, plsIf Russell Westbrook gets traded to Houston, this is how I *actually* think it would play out:

He agrees to stay away from the Rockets for the rest of the year. Rather than playing this season, he stays in LA with his family. Then they figure out a buyout in the offseason.I just need to know if my veteran PG is gonna be a blood or a crip @HoustonRockets@LegionHoops @TheSteinLine @HoustonRockets he just left!!!ULTIMA HORA: Los Houston Rockets interesados en Russell Westbrook https://t.co/xTSXM64cJo@RooshWilliams @Less_HumbleTeej @HoustonRockets Yeah I think the apprehension was that a lot of us assumed he wouldn‚Äôt get bought out@RooshWilliams @HoustonRockets As long as he don‚Äôt ever hit that court I‚Äôm in@cameronwolf24 I mean, technically, a player doesn't have a choice in sitting out. Wall has made it easy for Houston, but like, if the Rockets needed to, they could just never put Westbrook in the game.@Less_HumbleTeej @HoustonRockets Why?

Dissolve Houston Rockets at this point https://t.co/aS9hGwUy9mDo it @HoustonRockets https://t.co/hLYvnHMQMzThe Rockets have strategically tied pick swaps to other first-round picks they're owed in order to increase their chances of getting a higher pick. For example, tying the Miami swap with the Brooklyn first they're owed this season gives Houston the higher selection of the two.Via @TheSteinLine: there at least 1 team that would be open to Westbrook trade.
 
‚ÄúThat team, surprisingly, is the Houston Rockets.‚Äù 

Westbrook played in Houston during the ‚Äò20 season. The Rockets are in a position to take on bad contract if draft picks are attached. #NBAAllStar https://t.co/GZuyFlWLGi@ksgrt6 @Less_HumbleTeej @HoustonRockets I know I was playin lol. Yuck thoRussell Westbrook will be traded to the Houston Rockets, he will also renegotiate an extension for more years for lower annuals moving forward. Russ is done with the Lakers.@TheHusayn @HoustonRockets LMFAOOOOOOO YOU HEARD IT HERE FIRST FOLKS!As a dedicated Rockets superfan, I agree that she‚Äôs right!!! Bring Russ back @HoustonRockets https://t.co/jefOOMdHsNAccording to @TheSteinLine there is 1 team that would take Russell Westbrook‚Ä¶

‚ÄúThat team, surprisingly, is the Houston Rockets.‚Äù

Antoher John Wall for Russell Westbrook trade? üòÇ #NBA #Rockets #LakeShow https://t.co/afhLfs6yFaThe Houston Rockets Luc Monte had a terrible warmup and won't play.@MrIzzy0714 @SamQuinnCBS He wouldn't be giving up $47M. He would get still get paid something like $42M from the Rockets and then go make that $5M back from whichever team signs him next. The alternative for Houston is paying Wall $47M to not play so they're saving $5M and getting picks from the Lakers.As a lifelong Houston Rockets fan I need you to listen to actual fans and not Packer fans @HoustonRockets 

We want Russ back!!!! https://t.co/vRHHXMLKl9The irony with Russ to Rockets rumours is he was actually looking great in Houston tbh. Why did they trade him ??I STG man don‚Äôt do this shit @HoustonRocketsThere is at least one team out there that would take Russell Westbrook if the conditions are right. 

‚ÄúThat team, surprisingly, is the Houston Rockets,‚Äù per @TheSteinLine #LakeShow #Rockets https://t.co/VGY1b89XJlThere is at least one team out there that would take Russell Westbrook if the conditions are right, per @TheSteinLine

Russell Westbrook + a protected first round pick to the Rockets

Russ then agrees to a buyout with Houston and signs with the Clippers.

Win-Win-Win https://t.co/vpDOv0uTdVInteresting from @TheSteinLine here: He reports the Houston Rockets would possibly take Russell Westbrook back for John Wall if the Lakers included the 2027 first-round pick.
