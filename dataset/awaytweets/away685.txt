Warriors are on the second night of a back to back, and yesterday’s game went to overtime. Warriors will also be without Klay &amp; Draymond, so Rockets +11 looks like the best play https://t.co/MWhuhVfAeadear @HoustonRockets, 
please trade for russell westbrook
thank you@HoustonRockets @JalenGreen @Jaygup23 PLEASE dont trade for Westbrick!!@HoustonRockets @JalenGreen @Jaygup23 Let Jalen run the offense today, plsIf Russell Westbrook gets traded to Houston, this is how I *actually* think it would play out:

He agrees to stay away from the Rockets for the rest of the year. Rather than playing this season, he stays in LA with his family. Then they figure out a buyout in the offseason.I just need to know if my veteran PG is gonna be a blood or a crip @HoustonRockets@LegionHoops @TheSteinLine @HoustonRockets he just left!!!ULTIMA HORA: Los Houston Rockets interesados en Russell Westbrook https://t.co/xTSXM64cJo@RooshWilliams @Less_HumbleTeej @HoustonRockets Yeah I think the apprehension was that a lot of us assumed he wouldn’t get bought out@RooshWilliams @HoustonRockets As long as he don’t ever hit that court I’m in@cameronwolf24 I mean, technically, a player doesn't have a choice in sitting out. Wall has made it easy for Houston, but like, if the Rockets needed to, they could just never put Westbrook in the game.@Less_HumbleTeej @HoustonRockets Why? Snag a first and let Russ walk and we’re done@TheNBACentral @TheSteinLine The man was ballin with The Rockets 🚀 b4 he got hurt WTH is the Houston fans crying about@TheNBACentral @TheSteinLine This seems to have been said Stein and Houston Rockets as a form of low hanging fruit humor than being realistic.

The Rockets are gonna have a $44 million player not playing for them either way. I think having the one that comes with some second-rounders is better than the alternative, all things being equal. If Houston disagrees? Cool.Per @TheSteinLine, Houston is interested in trading for Brodie 👀

LETS RIDEREE #GamblingTwiiter@yossyol Wait who said Russ might come back to Houston? As a Rockets fan, I do not want that to happen tbhFuck the @Lakers DONT trade with them let them suck forever! @HoustonRockets@Less_HumbleTeej @HoustonRockets I trust in Stone - if we get a bounty of picks, I’ll gladly do itHouston rockets are crackheads 😭 https://t.co/oSQskPtm3t@Less_HumbleTeej @HoustonRockets If lakers send picks and we just buyout Russ cus he’s probably more likely to accept one, I’d do it in a heartbeat@Less_HumbleTeej @HoustonRockets GET THE BAND BACK TOGETHER!!!You my cinnamon apple. Don’t do it @HoustonRockets@TheNBACentral @TheSteinLine Pleaseeee @HoustonRockets  please 🙏🙏They traded these two players ALREADY. Dissolve Houston Rockets at this point https://t.co/aS9hGwUy9mDo it @HoustonRockets https://t.co/hLYvnHMQMzThe Rockets have strategically tied pick swaps to other first-round picks they're owed in order to increase their chances of getting a higher pick. For example, tying the Miami swap with the Brooklyn first they're owed this season gives Houston the higher selection of the two.Via @TheSteinLine: there at least 1 team that would be open to Westbrook trade.
 
“That team, surprisingly, is the Houston Rockets.” 

Westbrook played in Houston during the ‘20 season. The Rockets are in a position to take on bad contract if draft picks are attached. #NBAAllStar https://t.co/GZuyFlWLGi@ksgrt6 @Less_HumbleTeej @HoustonRockets I know I was playin lol. Yuck thoRussell Westbrook will be traded to the Houston Rockets, he will also renegotiate an extension for more years for lower annuals moving forward. Russ is done with the Lakers.@TheHusayn @HoustonRockets LMFAOOOOOOO YOU HEARD IT HERE FIRST FOLKS!As a dedicated Rockets superfan, I agree that she’s right!!! Bring Russ back @HoustonRockets https://t.co/jefOOMdHsNAccording to @TheSteinLine there is 1 team that would take Russell Westbrook…

“That team, surprisingly, is the Houston Rockets.”

Antoher John Wall for Russell Westbrook trade? 😂 #NBA #Rockets #LakeShow https://t.co/afhLfs6yFaThe Houston Rockets Luc Monte had a terrible warmup and won't play.@MrIzzy0714 @SamQuinnCBS He wouldn't be giving up $47M. He would get still get paid something like $42M from the Rockets and then go make that $5M back from whichever team signs him next. The alternative for Houston is paying Wall $47M to not play so they're saving $5M and getting picks from the Lakers.As a lifelong Houston Rockets fan I need you to listen to actual fans and not Packer fans @HoustonRockets 

We want Russ back!!!! https://t.co/vRHHXMLKl9The irony with Russ to Rockets rumours is he was actually looking great in Houston tbh. Why did they trade him ??I STG man don’t do this shit @HoustonRocketsThere is at least one team out there that would take Russell Westbrook if the conditions are right. 

“That team, surprisingly, is the Houston Rockets,” per @TheSteinLine #LakeShow #Rockets https://t.co/VGY1b89XJlThere is at least one team out there that would take Russell Westbrook if the conditions are right, per @TheSteinLine

John Wall to the Lakers
Russell Westbrook + a protected first round pick to the Rockets

Russ then agrees to a buyout with Houston and signs with the Clippers.

Win-Win-Win https://t.co/vpDOv0uTdVInteresting from @TheSteinLine here: He reports the Houston Rockets would possibly take Russell Westbrook back for John Wall if the Lakers included the 2027 first-round pick. (Check out his latest column for more context: https://t.co/ATjUZTTtrP) https://t.co/NZYAQVn1ez@marioelie1 @HoustonRockets Never underestimate the heart of a champion. https://t.co/3su8SrQQHDThere is at least one team out there that would take Russell Westbrook if the conditions are right, per @TheSteinLine

John Wall… Oh the guy that the Houston Rockets young guys like Jalen Green and KPJ could use to lean on and mentor through the season instead of them sitting him out waiting for a trade. Yeah in that way Ivey and Wall are very comparable@ikelove99 YEP! Houston sports is cursed man. Rockets should have at least kept the band together@HoustonRockets….. buyout John Wall@MarryYoda You crazy bro 😂. But that's how it happens with all the major Houston sports teams. Astros trade somebody mid season they end up winning the world series. Texans get rid of a coach the team he go to win a superbowl.
