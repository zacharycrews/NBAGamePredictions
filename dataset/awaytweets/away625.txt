The Irish fled to the US and started the Boston Celtics.New post (Boston Celtics vs Philadelphia 76ers NBA Pick ‚Äì January 14) has been published on The Sports Geek - https://t.co/cDjDfD9aum https://t.co/Km8KZVus0q@celtics it‚Äôs not too late https://t.co/a0dM9J8cQP@celtics find ways to get Bogy and John Collins https://t.co/2qjtGm4CtT@celtics These C's are too awful to vote for.  Last thing we should be doing is encouraging any of this garbage.The Boston Celtics are reportedly interested in Jalen Smith here are my thoughts.

Teams:
- Utah Jazz
- Indiana Pacers
- Boston Celtics 

Jazz get Smart, Brown, and Holiday while Celtics get Turner, LeVert, Conley, Warren. Pacers get 2022 &amp; 2024 Boston 1sts and 2027 Jazz 1st, Butler, Dok for giving up Turner &amp; LeVert while taking on Horford, Ingles. https://t.co/1752L7S9x5NBA Rumors: Phoenix Suns Linked To Jalen Smith Trade Deal With Boston¬†Celtics https://t.co/4i1LmjZgIZ@celtics If I hadn‚Äôt already canceled my NBA team league pass, I would have now.Boston brawl #boston #celtics #tdgarden #fights #mma #live #fight #nba #... https://t.co/nmbc3YEZVs via @YouTube @TJ_and_TGOM@itsPrez @celtics Cause we beat the juggernaut Pacers twice?

Evil stuff@chrisgrenham I still want Kornet on the Boston Celtics. Too bad he‚Äôs not really making his 3s tho.Boston Celtics: WATCH: Tatum, Brown get Boston 67 points combined vs. Pacers - #Celtics Wire https://t.co/a5OpuHRIJR@celtics Wow just wowBoston Celtics Daily Links  1/13/22 https://t.co/4caKOEiVBN https://t.co/spEJ6FiGZY6/ IMHO the way @celtics are positioned, they should be preparing to grab one using all the capital they have outside their 3 best players. That includes going after Simmons. These elite passers are just really hard to come by. And more often that not, when you have one, you win.1/ For my few friends &amp; followers on #basketballtwitter ‚Äî I‚Äôve been thinking about how @celtics can acquire an elite passer without trading core of @jaytatum0 @FCHWPO &amp; @rob_williamsIII

The same rule falls on the Bruins, WWE, concerts and any event incoming to anywhere in the City of Boston. 
This is a City of Boston rule, not a Boston Celtics rule.@W4k3up_ @ZackJHochberg @AndrewHolt7 @celtics But it's not the Boston Celtics fault, Celtics, Bruins, any incoming concerts has to follow the same. 
I don't blame you for being pissed but complain to @MayorWu she's the one who's responsible.@celtics So is schroder coming around for you again? You know if hes not traded he will be back on the mle which I've been saying will happen since we signed him.@Darkwynternight @celtics Well that's the bright side. https://t.co/tMeFpPJJ3nThis week on The Long Two, @bladner_ breaks down...

I am vaxxed and wear my mask but I am wondering why you do not enforce the mask policy for all?  None of us want to wear it however your ushers tend to focus on those NOT in the floor seats. Enforce it or not but don't do it for show.@Becoming_Bryna @paulpierce34 @cedricmaxwell81 @KevinGarnett5KG @jaytatum0 @FCHWPO @RealBillRussell @Max_Lederman @AnnaHorford @ChrisForsberg_ @Amanda_Pflugrad @celtics Thank you!

As in the players adjust to the culture established (win or lose)s Perhaps the @Bucks now?
