I'll admit this is a bit of a strange projection given Sacramento's COVID issues and San Antonio's relative health, but I see the Kings as the better team in this one.

Value: Spurs Team Total u116 &amp; Kings +4The Kings are going to fall just short of the postponement requirement, fall from 10th to 12th, lose the tiebreaker vs San Antonio, and get all of the Spurs sick, too. Real lose/lose What a time that'll be!I like LeBron but bringing him in will literally set us back. We are almost close to having one of thee best Dynasty team that NBA haven't seen since San Antonio Spurs the Tim Duncan era and our fans wants to gut this roster just to have one more. You fanboys are nutz. https://t.co/M1hpsDbCse@parfait_mwambay Sorry to disappoint you mate , I was talking about Tottenham spurs , don‚Äôt nobody cares or watch the San Antonio spurs! üòÇTop NBA Consensus (So Far)
