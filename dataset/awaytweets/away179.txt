Marvin Bagley, Tristan Thompson and 2022 1st rd pick (top 3 protected) to the Rockets for Christian Wood. @SacramentoKingsBoth Darryl Morey and Rich Paul are making the NBA look foolish. 

The same is trending with the situation with Marvin Bagley and the Sacramento Kings.

Both teams need to end their situations fast, or let the league intervene.@DudeMcstuffins @SacramentoKings You still never tell your coach no. That‚Äôs just unacceptable@TujuMaster @SacramentoKings Lol ya I‚Äôm just tired of this clowns nonsense@MaxThaDemon_ @SacramentoKings yo they've kept Marvin on the bench all year because they're obviously in the middle of trade talks. asking him to come was weird in the first place.Let me tell y‚Äôall how fun it is to be a 49ers fan AND Sacramento kings fan https://t.co/R5bkXYfZ1h https://t.co/0nvvBg0T4c@SacramentoKings @moe_harkless LOU KING!
