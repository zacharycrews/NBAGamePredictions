Not playing for the @SacramentoKings@nonya1239 @sixers @cryptocom @Timberwolves @warriors @hornets @chicagobulls @cavs @ATLHawks @DetroitPistons @nyknicks @WashWizards @Suns @spurs @SacramentoKings @PelicansNBA @celtics @OrlandoMagic @trailblazers @dallasmavs @BrooklynNets @MiamiHEAT yea not like edwards had 48 yesterday :)@MrMichaelLee I often wonder if Scottie Pippen would ever have been a great player on a team like the Sacramento Kings back in those years.  In other words, I think Michael Jordan made Scottie look better than he really was!@sixers @cryptocom Win or lose I would like to personally thank @Timberwolves @warriors @hornets @chicagobulls @cavs @ATLHawks @DetroitPistons @nyknicks @WashWizards @Suns @spurs @SacramentoKings @PelicansNBA @celtics @OrlandoMagic @trailblazers @Timberwolves @dallasmavs @BrooklynNets @MiamiHEAT https://t.co/Z2H4yhfrhFMarvin Bagley III refuses to check into Sacramento Kings game https://t.co/QWAWnu7P5V@CarmichaelDave Agreed Kings need to put an end to  drama be up front and public about it...Send a clear message no more nonsense in Sacramento. We don't want another season of soap opera everyday news vs JUST BASKETBALL@J_Timberfake_ they should seek advice from the Sacramento Kings twitter@j0j0916 @SacramentoKings @swipathefox Im saying in terms of accomplishment, he went to the playoffs with the kings. Hes the last player on the kings to hit a game winning shot in the playoffs. had multiple high scoring games including dropping 50 on the warriors.@femedeirostt @NBABrasil Sacramento Kings!!Marvin Bagley u have some damn nerve. @SacramentoKings Trade him or cut him at this point plz@PLS4061 @SacramentoKings You okay, buddy?@Nardelli_M @nbatopshot @SacramentoKings @TyHaliburton22 Ya just checked my account.. crazy my account evaluation went down since the season started. ;( Sup w that@SacramentoKings I'd hope so. There's still 70 games to play. A 3-game losing streak shouldn't break a team.@SHED_mdrn_lvng @nbatopshot @SacramentoKings @TyHaliburton22 Ball is life 🏀🙌🏻@SHED_mdrn_lvng @nbatopshot @SacramentoKings @TyHaliburton22 DO ITTTTT 🔥🔥🔥 I love it so much !!@Nardelli_M @nbatopshot @SacramentoKings @TyHaliburton22 i kindawanna dive back into topshot a lil bit
