Either Hawks ownership is dumb as dirt or NBA is unrealistic to require development large to play?@WillDad @MikeBellATL @ATLHawks Teams are required to sign replacements for players that go in to protocols.

Teams cannot sign replacements for injured players if they don't have an open roster spot.@LakeShowBoy24 @CarterFGlenn @wojespn @ATLHawks cause they signing 10 day condos@FIizop @ATLHawks @TheTraeYoung We also had players missing from protocols so I guess your in the same boat as we wereThe Atlanta Hawks are on the road tonight in the Windy City to face DeMar DeRozan, Zach Lavine and the Chicago Bulls
