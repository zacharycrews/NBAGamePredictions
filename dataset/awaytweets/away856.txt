Just admit it and end the BS comparisons. #WeTheNorth@_RealG15 @Raptors Cavs are number 1 or 2 when it comes to defence in the East. 4th overall in the league. Who do you think is a factor for that?

Kawhi doesn't tell his own team or sit on the bench when he's injured, I don't think he cares about fans. He never left his hotel during the ASG weekend in Toronto

To view this bet or copy it https://t.co/KS2hhKCKSq https://t.co/1S9WNB7LTl@RamsNFL made the Stafford Goff trade and it worked out like the Kawhi DeRozan, JV Marc Gasol trades. Sometimes a team needs to make a big move. @Raptors #WeTheNorth@Raptors I need this feeling that LA has rn. 🥲@fuutuuuree @william_lou Seems like you’re coping extemeley hard that the Celtics have the best record vs teams over .500 and the Raptors are 13-17

Remember that stretch in January where Toronto played like 6 teams in a row who didnt have their best players? 😂😂

Keep tweeting through itHear me out: Demar DeRozan got traded out of Toronto, and the Raptors won the championship the year after. DeRozan is having an MVP season a few years after.Watching any team become a champion takes me back to the Toronto Raptors winning in 2019.

You never forget something like that.@__bbell Toronto Raptors win the NBA championship so theirs that lol@avatart0ph @aybae1 @OwnedByToronto @ACHlUWA @Raptors The Tampa season mixed in with Baynes made a lot of guys look too good than what they actually are

Oh and Nurse would be playing him (and the others) if they weren't dogcrap so yeah 🤷🏾‍♂️I never bet on sports because the team I want to win always loses. The exceptions are the Bluejays in the 91/92, 92/93, and then the Raptors. And no I’m not only cheering for Toronto teams. So… if your team has lost between 1995 and now, it’s because I wanted them to win too.I have now seen the @Raptors and @RamsNFL win the championship...I am so happy!!!I wonder what’s it like living in a city where their sport teams win every couple years 🙄. #Rams
