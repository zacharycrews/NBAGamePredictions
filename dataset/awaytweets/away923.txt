All he has to do is facilitate and play defense. I don’t see where the liability lies especially since he doesn’t have to scoreToday is my final day with @BrooklynNets and it's been an incredible ride.

1. The @BrooklynNets super team 
2. The Russian invasion, so far.
3. The proof of vax campaign@BrooklynNets @CanonUSA Why he still bothers going to the arena ?
Man sorry for this extensive text. But that´s how we feel every damn game when We do not have KD, Irving on the court. I wait allll the long to see watch I saw yesterday. I am done! KD HAS TO MOVE.I swear this year being a nets fan is very emotional 😭  #brooklynnets #brooklyn #nba #Nets@BrooklynNets @CanonUSA out of the blue he figures that his fav player ain´t on the court because he refuses to get a shot. The team is doing really bad coz it´s poorly coached. They traded for a a guy who refuses to play the game coz mental problems. What´s his hope ?@BrooklynNets @CanonUSA Now you imagine a person who works 24/7 and he waits patiently all day long to watch the game of Basketball. He buy the last row because he can´t afford better ones. When the time comes, he dresses wit his fav player jersey and go to the arena.@TheHoopCentral @BrooklynNets need to get it together@TDChannel1 The @MapleLeafs defeated the @Capitals 5-3 last night.  Next game tomorrow against the @BuffaloSabres at 7:30PM.

The @Raptors beat the @BrooklynNets 133-97 last night.  Hopefully they can do it again tonight when they host the Nets at 7:30PM.

I hope the Nets win tomorrow tho.The latest on Brooklyn is... they're still terrible. The Nets lost tonight to the Raptors by 36.

If they lose again tomorrow in Toronto and the Clippers beat the Rockets, the pick owed to Houston will be at #15, which is the very best it can be without being in the lottery.Call me when the people involved in the Nets organisation start taking this season seriously. 

And I am talking about ALL THE PEOPLE. 

This is currently acceptable.

Is there a coach on the Nets?Final: @Raptors 133 @BrooklynNets 97 #WeTheNorth #NetsWorldAfter losing their last couple games by a combined 59 pts, the Raptors beat Brooklyn by 36. Forget who's not playing, that's a really good bounce-back win, especially with the Nets right behind them in the very tight East play-in race. They'll see them again in Toronto tomorrow@BrooklynNets are 8th in the east. But tomorrow @stephenasmith and the talking heads will all be insisting the Nets are title contenders.Toronto Raptors taking it, to the Brooklyn Nets. #WeTheNorthLove me a @BrooklynNets loss! 

#WeTheNorthHow are we getting cooked like this? @BrooklynNetsAnd that's the game, Raptors with a huge bounce back win tonight in Brooklyn as they beat the Nets 133-97.

No coach, no team. It is just KD and nothing else... KI is not committed, he is the same as Harden.. don't pay to this kind  of players..@BrooklynNets Bring Kd back, this team sucks@aldemaro_g @BrooklynNets I went to the game against Boston on Thursday…$120 for a ticket, $50 for parking and $30 for food to stay and watch for three quarters. 😔Why am I still watching this game….? @BrooklynNets@brooklynnets85 @BrooklynNets should give @Patty_Mills a week off.

How pathetic are the Nets at home ?

To all those moronic Nets fans….happy you’ve signed that fraud Simmons ?@jason05_ ECF will not go through Brooklyn, East is too tough. Heat, Bucks, can both face Nets in 1st round and beat them. Now maybe Nets can beat Cavs,Raps,Bulls in a 7game, But even if they do that, they still have to beat Philly.Brooklyn Nets have played both Aldridge and Drummond at center tonight. Griffin has gotten minutes too. But Raptors have out-rebounded them bcos they have rangy wings.@seansharkey15 @TebowCouch @PittGotNext @BrooklynNets Nets are literally not even guaranteed to go to the playoffs they are a play in team, the way y’all playing it’s looking like y’all not getting past that@BrooklynNets Damn we're about to get blown out 2 days in a row ?! 😳Raps are up 36 on the Nets lol they really said fuck Brooklyn.@averagenetsfan @jeremysiemsen @BrooklynNets lol. Pot calling the kettle u halfwit.
How are your Nets going today ?
Winning ?@Shainevercaps @BrooklynNets We worth nothing without kd Ben ain't doin shi rn@BrooklynNets WHAT@FuckTheVikings8 @BrooklynNets Like Harden didn’t score 4points an entire game in his last days..@NSimmo10 @BrooklynNets @sdotcurry @AndreDrummond @_claxton33 At the end of the day, he’s gotta improve his shot. He’s got a good game, but it doesn’t fit his size. He’s gotta become a Chris bosh type. If he can become Serge Ibaka, then that’d be ideal. I see him more like an Anthony Randolph though. Which is still very good in today’s NBA.Dear Brooklyn Nets tonight was awful and I know you know that but us die hard fans do not sacrifice our time to watch this we just beat the bucks@TebowCouch @JayRule123 @PittGotNext @BrooklynNets Come back to this tweet when the nets get further than the 6ers in the playoffs@SixSalute @jeremysiemsen @BrooklynNets Ahh I get it now, your delusional good bye@Conrad_Wilson @BrooklynNets @TheTick3t Ya courtside is overrated anyways@seansharkey15 @JayRule123 @PittGotNext @BrooklynNets So they’d score 35?“Brooklyn Nets guard David Duke jr” LMFAO@BrooklynNets let ben ramp up in game and get KD in please😹@BrooklynNets LMAO, Cam Thomas can outplay the whole team@averagenetsfan @jeremysiemsen @BrooklynNets No, I’m a realist.

@Raptors @BrooklynNets 🔥🔥🔥20 days later…

The @BrooklynNets are *just* clinging on to their spot as favorites in the Eastern Conference!

Since we tweeted those odds they’ve gone 3-5 and are now 23 points down at HT to the Raptors 👀 https://t.co/QQqZ3OStQs https://t.co/oEkeuh4OT3@jeremysiemsen @BrooklynNets He won’t. 
Nets are garbage@BrooklynNets Y’all making the Lakers look good@PhilosophRKing3 @BrooklynNets Simmons will make no difference. In the playoffs he’s a liability.A reminder, with the score tied at 65 and under five minutes to play: This is not a loss UNC can afford. Say what you will about the NET, but this would be a Q3 loss, just weeks after a Q4 loss.

Lose tonight, and UNC has to either beat Duke or win it all in Brooklyn.@BrooklynNets Just pay the damn fine!@BrooklynNets WE OWN YOUThat's a wild half from Raptors after eight terrible quarters after all-star break. Everything that was missing -- energy, focus, confidence - showing up so far against Brooklyn as they lead the Nets 71-48. Scottie Barnes and Malachi Flynn combine to go  15/16 from the floor.@BrooklynNets Too funny. Nets getting whacked AGAIN !
