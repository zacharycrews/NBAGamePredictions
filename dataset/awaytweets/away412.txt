3rd quarter.  Set the tone! No choking!

Let’s roll with what’s been working. Make adjustments. Finish this thing

 #SACvsTOR@Raptors Siakam almost perfect that half, and Boucher contributing offensively but still needs help on the defensive end. Unless they completely collapse in the second half I’ll change my call to trade Siakam to trade Boucher instead, and probably include Flynn for an upgrade at Center.@Raptors So far so good!
