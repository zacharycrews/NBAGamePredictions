“Been doing it all season while missing a couple guys. That’s what they do. They’re a #ReallyGood team. Tough #defensively.

Heat fans always show up late, it's just a Miami thing.REPORT: James Harden was seen at a night club (The Office) in Miami, FL last night. He was there until 5AM this morning. That could be an indication on why he is listed as OUT for tonight’s game vs the Heat.

Two teams that like to play at a snail's pace compared to the rest of the league square off tonight when the Philadelphia 76ers host the Miami Heat.  I expect a low-scoring, defensive battle in this one, which has proven to be the case@HeatvsHaters I like the idea of beal in miami but not at the cost of losing herro.

#MarchMadness 
#NCAATournamentCan the #Sixers do this tomorrow against the #MiamiHeat? #HereTheyComeNotice how when the @MiamiHEAT are good, the @CanesHoops are good. They have their own Lowery, Butler and Bam. It's like watching the Heat. #HEATCulture@MiamiHEAT ang CRACKLINGS sa juuuuud♥This day in Greg Monroe History: Greg Monroe and the Detroit Pistons played the Miami Heat. The Heat won in a 106-92 dogfight. The Pistons sold on Greg Monroe while he provided the team 8 pts, 2 ast, and 4 reb. Greg Monroe’s excellent performance was wasted. 😔@JuwanHoward @MiamiHEAT You are a leader of men and I appreciate the way you supported Chandler after your win. You are doing the right thing and I’m rooting for you.One more day til I see my boys in Philly!!! @MiamiHEAT https://t.co/QzsEb5fw0w@SmartJames1981 @BillfromBoynton I'm noy going to that far since I live in Miami, dolphins being good is great for my city period, just like the Heat, Marlins and Um, fuck it the panthers to.. now does it effect who I'm and how go about my daily never that.. but when the dolphins are good the city booming https://t.co/Oa3I54Zb2LAlso looking at the schedule the @MiamiHEAT haven’t played since Friday this has to be the biggest joke of the season. At least make them have to play tonight 🤬 #Sixers #NBA75 #NBATwitterLiveA few years ago, I met him (very briefly) in San Antonio, TX when he was with the @MiamiHEAT — they were at dinner, I was just passing through, &amp; he made time when he didn’t have to.

Just human, kind, and accessible. He understood I was in shock to see him. He showed grace.I’m tryna get sponsored my Miami Heat lolMiami Heat is what NBA players come to the best team in the universe of sportsSixers have 2 huge back to back games starting tonight with Toronto, and then against the current East leaders Miami Heat tomorrow night. It’s good to see Embiid in the lineup tonight, but we will see if Doc rests either him or Harden tomorrow. Sixers Raptors tip off at 8:40@MiamiHEAT @Publix Happy Birthday Pat Riley.@CanesWarningFS @CanesHoops @watscocenter @MiamiHEAT Well we both probably didn't discuss Jordan Miller giving him work earlyYou've been amazing despite several setbacks this season @MiamiHEAT I love 😍 you #HEATCulture@huemankindco @FTXArena @MiamiHEAT @sthetixx Sooooo hard! 🔥 Heat in 4!@YvanMontgury @patrileyfan @LakersLead @LakersVintage @retro_70s @Lakers @TeamRetroUS @Kentuckybasket6 @SInow @MiamiHEAT @bttfubb Excellent thread and photosCheck out 2003 TOPPS CHROME DWYANE WADE RC MIAMI HEAT BASKETBALL CARD #115 GRADED PSA 10!! https://t.co/JBOt6tvWeW @eBay@MiamiHEAT Caleb w/ the Miss Vickie’s BBQ chips😤. Hang #16 in the rafters.@HeatBetter Once again the sixers gotta play a rested heat team on the 2nd of back to back.  Not playing till 8:30 tonight vs Toronto then goes play Miami tomorrow.  Which means at least 1 out of embiid and harden probably won't play.  Smh@lilwaltjr305 @CanesHoops @watscocenter @MiamiHEAT Go back and read the previous threads. Its already been discussed.@joegrine954 @JuwanHoward @OmarKelly @MiamiHEAT "Proud" of a guy who slapped his childhood friend on national television?Check out the latest episode of @FiveOnTheFloor5 on the #MiamiHeat and #NBA https://t.co/fM55nrE9Qy on #Podbean#NBA Power Rankings 03/20:
