Foul trouble has limited him a little bit in yeas past, but has been more successful this year. JJJ leads the league in block percentage, also #NBA #GrizzliesAll good vibes as the Memphis Grizzlies round the corner towards the playoffs with the second seed all locked up

Spurs move into 9th with a win and an incredibly unlikely loss by the Pelicans to the Blazers.Memphis Grizzlies’ team MVP for the 2021-22 season, is Ja Morant (obviously). Desmond Bane has played VERY well for Memphis this year as well as he has played more than Ja Morant, and I have Bane as MEM’s biggest surprise of the 2021-22 season #NBA #GrizzliesIs the Memphis Grizzlies coach getting any recognition for being a good coach this year? https://t.co/lD3xvvp5Ir@GTC901 @memgrizz Got mine.@LakeShowYo Memphis GrizzliesPera reached billionaire status in his mid 30's and bought the Memphis Grizzlies in 2012 for $350 million. Under his leadership the team has consistently made the playoffs and has had a few 50 win seasons. He is now worth $18 billion. Robert Pera is Black ownership in the NBA. https://t.co/C1IO1ufDUu@johndoe63460857 @AndrewRiffe1 @SDeslippe ok but why over the last 20 games Raps defense is better?
