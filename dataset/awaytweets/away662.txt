Listen Here: https://t.co/f8kYolelfs@hornets @LendingTree Hope LaMelo plays. We need him tonight.@HornetsPR @hornets Tsunami warning in Boston tonight@TermineRadio Eddie said Boston and Charlotte are similar. They are opposites. Hornets can’t stop me, but they can score. Cs can’t score against me, but they are great defensively. Cs top heavy with no depth. Hornets have depth. Not similar at all. 🤣😂Can somebody make a @hornets GC😂

#AllFly#Hornets are fully loaded. They fly up the floor, which doesn’t bode well for #Celtics given their misses and turnovers. They haven’t been the best transition defensive team. Charlotte has been better defensively in the new year too. 11th over their last 8 games (5-3).Charlotte Hornets basketball socialism. https://t.co/2d3xQ751V7INJURY UPDATE: @hornets @ BOS 1/19

Boston Celtics VS Charlotte Hornets – Hornets ML (2.40)

When I saw this line at first, I thought it was a joke by the bookies, but no, the Boston Celtics really are a 4 point favourite in this one 😮.Al Horford (BOS) Over 20.5 Pts+Reb (-110 DK)

As I said with Robert Williams. This should be another easy lock with the Charlotte Hornets giving up the most points and rebounds to opposing centers in the NBA. The rest is up to Mr. Al.

Very even matchup between these 2 teams, take the great value on Hornets ML. Both teams won last 5/6 games. Hornets offense ranked 2nd in scoring compared to a Celtics team ranked 19th. Should be a fantastic game on #ESPN

#lock #it #inDeHilla had Minnesota's away bench below on her left, Charlotte's to her right, and this awesome center court view of the #Hornet's protecting the basket as the #Timberwolves attempt to gain the lead, at the start of the 2nd quater, from the 3pt line. https://t.co/XOsgRp3FQk@hornets @242_jones Give him some MINUTES@hornets @JasonNg1359 @242_jones Unleash him@celtics @hornets @NBCSBoston @espn @985TheSportsHub I'm going it'd it'd bday today I can't wait for tonight@Canes Just wait until the @hornets play today.  #AllFly #takewarning"Winning plays don’t always make the highlight reels, or even show up in the final box score at all.
