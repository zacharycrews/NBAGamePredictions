As a player, did Jerry dye his hair? WTF.@Mice25 @throwitdeeppod @can1p3tyourd0g @NFL Already explained the Lakers. 

The "Utah Jazz", however, is universally agreed to be stupid.Hey @utahjazz it would’ve been Coach Sloan’s 80th birthday today. Fans still care about honoring legends that built this franchise. Especially Jerry. It’d be nice to see some love on social media.Keep my team's name out your MOUTH! @utahjazz @spidadmitchell @mconley11 @LesOlsonIT @NBAonTNT https://t.co/5orRRk1G5JNBA Basketball Game Betting Picks Simulator: 3/29/2022 10:00 PM ET - Utah Jazz vs. Los Angeles Clippers - YOU CAN RUN THE GAME SIMULATION FOR FREE HERE: https://t.co/Qgk9CVllk3 #nba #sportsbetting #freepicks #cappertekNBA plays March 28

#freeplays #nbaplay #MAXBET #nbabetDonovan Mitchell shows up best when it matter most. #TakeNote #utahjazz https://t.co/0JcWlvdVIh@SloanImperative @utahjazz @chicagobulls The #utahjazz are too busy being worried about hypothetical political/biological issues.@ZoneSportsNet @utahjazz @hornets @JakeScottZone @tlacomb @DLocke09 @kslsports Funny how everyone is giving up on the jazz. Nobody mentions the effect the joe ingles loss has or niang…Nominate a Jazz fan aged 18 or under who has their community’s back, and they could win the chance to raid a player’s locker 🔓

𝙳𝙴𝚃𝙰𝙸𝙻: https://t.co/DCepMfONJL@utahjazz  look what we found!! Tons of 30 year old basketball cards https://t.co/RSCUNiJ9xr.@JordanClarksons had a bucket-filled week for the @utahjazz, averaging 15.5 PTS throughout 4 games! 🎵 

#NBA75 https://t.co/P0PgBMp0ul@utahjazz Chance of winning (questionable)@Jonatha01833784 @Lakers @Cincoro Yeah but I'm going to disagree are you still believe you're going to win do you beat the Utah jazz twice so I'm not giving up this this season🙏🙏Obv the one pretty purple jumper I found was of Utah Jazz@ufionbd @anthony24hrs @MaxMcMi Y’all are literally the Utah Jazz but in the Eastern conferenceDallas looks to be in a good spot for the 3 seed. If Warriors are healthy come playoffs, wouldn’t we much rather play Dallas than GS? I mean if we gotta drop to 6 to play Dallas and then Memphis and avoid GS or Phoenix until WCF I am all for it! #takenote @utahjazzAre you concerned about the #UtahJazz current 4 game losing streak??
@AlemaHarrington says the team is less concerned about it than Jazz Nation might be.

Be there. 🔥

Get tickets for the whole family here  ⤵️Watching nba tv and they are talking about John Stockton. Cut to Isaiah Thomas talking about a specific play he remembers of Stockton’s. He then describes the “John Stockton send the Utah jazz to the nba finals!” play. Thanks, Zeke. That’s some great insider info.@SloanImperative @utahjazz @chicagobulls I feel like Jerry was 80 for at least 2 decades.I’m honestly disappointed ands little sad that neither the @utahjazz nor the @chicagobulls sent out a tweet remembering the late, great Jerry Sloan on what would have been his 80th birthday.

You’re loved and missed, coach. https://t.co/qlbIN6eDpgThey're 30-24 after and 18-2 start. They're closer to the Utah Jazz than they are the Phoenix Suns

Always the chance the big 3 captures lightning in a bottle but it doesn't look good https://t.co/fZWVXso0bHDonovan Mitchell was an Astros farmhand who was a long-time minor league coach &amp; manager in the Mets organization before moving into their front office, where he still works. His son, Donovan Mitchell Jr, plays for the Utah Jazz. https://t.co/D0bARjxA6tAccording to reports, Paul George is expected to return in LA Clippers' match against the Utah Jazz.

The star forward has missed the last 43 games with a torn ulnar collateral ligament in his right elbow. https://t.co/MMoJeNqAWKI know faith in the Utah Jazz is eroded/eroding, but holy balls the end to this regular season is gonna be nuts. Seeds 3 through 6 could look completely different in two weeks and the playoffs are going to be wild.@StanunobyFan @KeithSmithNBA I guess he cant hate on any team besides the utah jazz@blueshockeygrl Mitchell on the Utah Jazz please.Omg is there a scenario where the Utah Jazz are a play in team????@JimboRudding Looks like you had a rough start to this Utah jazz podcast with video.The former Georgetown Hoyas star and, more recently, center for the Wizards’ G-League affiliate Capital City Go-Go, has been called up on a 10-day contract with the Utah Jazz. https://t.co/19Cdvi1iJG@varun_garg21 @utahjazz Can't choke in the playoffs, if you never make the playoffs in the first place. https://t.co/XLADhC4FEoOur new episode dropped today 
This week we interview a former #UtahJazz ball boy who shares tons of interesting stories. Including stories about players asking for help getting numbers from ladies in the arena 😳
