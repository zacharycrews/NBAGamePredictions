@StreakCoolersLooking for a value bet?  See if the Washington Wizards-Toronto Raptors Predictions and Preview for 12/5/2021 is one in our preview.  No crazy hype just a prediction and preview. #Sportsbook #GamblingTwitter https://t.co/OlIb68gErVWASHINGTON-RAPTORS BET ANALYSIS üèÄ:
I personally think this odds on wizards are bait from the books,  raptors are underachieving while wizards are OVERACHIEVING and by far (they have 3 wins more than they should have). Spread is not valuable because its just 1 point. So ML it is.Toronto Raptors Predictions and Preview for 12/5/2021 hosts Washington Wizards.  Looking for betting action?
