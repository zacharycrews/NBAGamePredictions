@PatrickKilken55 @memgrizz @SacramentoKings I love you Pat but 🤢🤢🤢🤢 those jerseys 🥴🥴🥴🥴🤣🤣@PackripMedia @SacramentoKings I’ll take any of ‘em you’d like to offload, if they’re cluttering up your collection. ☺️😂The Kings were swept by the Grizzlies last season, but Memphis is playing without Ja Morant and Sacramento is coming off a thrilling, 3-OT road victory over the Lakers on Friday night.

How y'all feeling, Kings fans?I want Matt Barnes @SacramentoKings! Kenny Thomas’ voice puts me to sleep 😴@PackripMedia @SacramentoKings The only thing that matters is stacking as many Davion Mitchell’s as possible by the end of the season 💎 🙌Let's go on a @SacramentoKings Top Shot shopping spree!?

Denver won't make that same mistake because they aren't insane, but it's important to know why Malone is STRESSED.Down $1000 parlay
