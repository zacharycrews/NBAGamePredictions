Let’s go!!! 

@JaMorant @memgrizz@irbishi @Lakers @memgrizz they will reach the 1st round only, I dont see them beating warriors/suns there.Watching the @lakers these past few games fills me with hope. A lot of players back and AD to return. They will perhaps lose to @memgrizz next game. But lakers are starting to build something.@DisneyDad9 @JaMorant @memgrizz It’s ok. Let me sneak up on everyone. Desmond Bane is also insaneNot enough people are talking about @JaMorant and the @memgrizz and that’s a shame https://t.co/Pm3iFAoVFx@jmay11 @memgrizz I saw that. They can do it.

But as he approaches his first #NBAAllStar appearance, his luminescence isn’t limited to shining on his own path. “The Dark” the Memphis Grizzlies have adopted is welcoming more light every day https://t.co/uS1DJ2aXVg@JackHoo12839456 @GrizzliesPR @memgrizz No trades!!

He’s the only real ‘big body center’ we have. JJJ is my 2nd favorite NBA player (behind Ja of course lol) but he’s much better suited as a PF. Maybe Aldama gets some big minutes? He’s looking better and better as the season goes onLos Angeles Lakers - Atlanta Hawks

He was a regular season all star there too but when the pressures on he collapses. They traded him for kawhi and won a championship.Ivica Zubac upgraded to questionable to return for tomorrow morning against the Memphis Grizzlies. He has missed the last 3 games in H&amp;S.

Kleinman is playing this game as well as (or better than) any other GM, with the most limited resources. Imagine if he could’ve gone out and got a Demar Derozan.@taylor_oaks @memgrizz I am in isolation. It’s literally all I have to look forward to. 😂@stevenrussell @memgrizz @aus10russell Awesome tweet!I love the Milwaukee Bucks with all my heart. Everyone knows that.

They literally got screwed over when the new owner said they wouldn't move them and the NBA agreed to sell it. What he do? He moved them. How is this any different than what happened in Seattle? It wasn't because a lack of fan support.@joealmanzar95 @FvdedChop @memgrizz @DetroitPistons I’m weak as hell 😂@memgrizz @JaMorant This guy enjoys flying@thoughtstuck @PeriodPooh42 @iconic_0ne @BballJones_313 @memgrizz @DetroitPistons My favorite team got four rings I believe, I’m good😭I’m jus a nba fan, true fan of the game.
