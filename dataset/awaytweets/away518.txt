Would love a @ZachLaVine or @DeMar_DeRozan jersey! XL plz

Chicago Bulls (-3.5) -106

Hammering this play early before the line moves. Season series is tied 1-1, I can’t see the pacers keeping up with the firepower from Chicago’s guards.

Both teams will be 23-10 if we win tomorrow but Bulls own the tiebreaker cause they kicked the Nets asses mwahahaThat's it i'm a fans of @chicagobulls right now, never been a fans of them even since MJ dynasty, and D-rose hype even tho' I put a lot of respect.

Trae averaged 28/10 in those games playing with a g-league roster, not to mention using a 2 game sample size is stupid in the first place@JJMaples55_MST Without Kyrie I think the Bulls beat the Nets in 6. Nets don’t have good rim protection and they play a lot of switch defense that’s a recipe for disaster against Chicago#FunFact: If the @chicagobulls win 50 straight they’d tie the 95-96 Bulls record of 72-10. Anything can happen. #nba #ChicagoBulls@goingnuclearrr @chicagobulls_12 @Asensii20 @ESPNNBA @KendrickPerkins No one is denying the hawks were in a tough situation…but we are comparing the players.

Ninja + Lupo event, 2+ hour delay b/c computers weren't updated with the latest patch, no water on site, minimal food, and delivery couldn't come to the top floor.

Ninja/Lupo were total pros though, kept people entertained.@RoundballW @balldontstop @chicagobulls And the "Never gets called" is the whole point.  It's a travel and people are complaining they never get called, which they should...@BN_Bulls @chicagobulls @1jordanbell First thing I thought of. I go to myself 🤔. The same Jordan Bell we sold to the Warriors 😂@dailyherald @McGrawDHSports @chicagobulls Any chance Patrick Williams can play this season?@RoundballW @balldontstop @chicagobulls Nope.  Not even 90% legal.  Or any percent.  Whatever that means...@chicagobulls @1jordanbell Hey @WaddleandSilvy We got our 2nd round pick back from the Warriors! Is there anything that AK can’t do!?@chicagobulls VS. THE WORLD at this point. Can you end this pandemic, too? Y’all can do anything!@chicagobulls @1jordanbell @WaddleandSilvy must be going bananas right nowChicago Bulls forward Patrick Williams still has cast on his hand and there's no rush from him and the team to return this season, per sources.

Williams recently started doing dribbling skills and working on other things to improve his game, sources added.The @chicagobulls have signed forward Jordan Bell to a 10-day contract via the NBA’s Hardship Exception. https://t.co/H1wzaRI7FN@chicagobulls @ZachLaVine Give Zach a max contract@chicagobulls @1jordanbell Remember when we traded him for a little money and he had his best game against us@chicagobulls @whitesox @BullsPR  Will the other Chicago teams step up to support a fellow Chicagoan's son? An 11 yr old losing both his parents (one a Chicago ESPN Bears reporter) in 2 years to cancer is horrible. Help support Parker's Fund https://t.co/BTYslO94kf@chicagobulls @1jordanbell Arturas really went all out when he wrote the script for this season.
