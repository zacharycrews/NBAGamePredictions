I actually think Bill would welcome Rick on, but doubt Rick would accept an invitation.  Thoughts?  Wanna host them both for a round table?  Play ref?  Hmm…@ChipTingle @warriors @Rick24Barry Shoddy journalism really affected Rick’s image. @BillSimmons should be ashamed of himself for calling Barry a “prick” and accusing his teammates of turning on him or Rick not trying in the 76 WCF based on Al McCoy’s bullshit.

Avoiding injuries and physically being available at a high level is part of the game. 
Lot of great athletes with potential whose bodies failed. 
Hope he comes back but he could be an Oden.Just posted a photo @ Chase Center - Home of the Golden State Warriors https://t.co/KlOOYb0LxxThe Golden State Warriors are trading Jayson Tatum to the Rockets for rookie Eric Paschall, per sources.@WashedSlim7 @Le10and0 @warriors @KDTrey5 If you can’t beat ‘em join emNBA playoffs going to be wild - to watch out for Grizzlies &amp; Celtics they will upset in the 1st /2nd round against a top seed.. hope @warriors can put up a show once playoffs start.. they need a healthy team to even get passed 1st round.. #hope #NBAPlayoffs@Le10and0 @warriors @KDTrey5 No one counts thisWhat if I told you Eric Musselman coached the Golden State Warriors in 2002????@warriors @futurefitapp Pls win y’all@warriors Who do you guys think is better at shooting klay or curry@TBracketology @PeacocksMBB I don't think they would be scared of the Golden State Warriors.@TheWarriorsTalk @warriors need improve the defense!!

Drive and kick for 3’s works if you’ve got Steph Curry and Klay Thompson. There aren’t a whole lot of those shooters around.I admit I’m a @StephenCurry30 fan and the @warriors are my team but I have love for the @NBA as a whole. I give honor to other players and teams when it’s deserved.@A_3_0_2 @SbtaughtU @warriors @StephenCurry30 Y’all don’t just appreciate hoops do you. Like some middle schoolers picking sides@ColinCowherd Nova shutting down the @warriors. Houston is a bad offensive team.@JeffGSpursZone Hah, as a Spurs fan in Warriors country at least my Golden State fan friends are thrilled about the idea of the Spurs possibly knocking the Lakers out of the play-in game.Deadpool Jordan  @warriors@patrickbetdavid Fc Liverpool or fc Barcelona or golden state warriors@warriors Klays got that look in his eyes.@22wiggins keep your head up and keep shooting that shit....if it doesn't go in, play harder on the defensive side and come back to it! You got this king!!! @warriorsAm I watching the Houston Cougars or the Houston Rockets against the Golden State Warriors@BigTicket_JW Just keep working big Wise! Us real @warriors fans are behind you 100%. Funny how things happen just know God has a plan for you. This should make you tougher, stronger both mentally and physically. Look at Klay and remember there’s a light at the end of the tunnel ✌🏾March 26, 1974: Golden State #Warriors SG Rick Barry scored 64 PTS vs. Portland. At the time, only Wilt Chamberlain &amp; Elvin Hayes had scored more in a NBA game. Barry's still the only player with 55+ PTS/5+ REB/5+ AST/5+ STL during 1 GP in NBA history https://t.co/5WCZVZ0o7G@warriors @futurefitapp @JonathanKuming6 @KlayThompson Tena pai klay.K shooting 🔫 threes 🎄 👫 🏀 now  for tomorrow's game klay.K stay safe mehe nui 💕💕💦🏀🌞Grizzlies win 9/10 games without Ja Morant

Do you understand that Steph is not KD/Lebron/Giannis/Kawhi? Golden State is only working as a big 3/big4. Even a dynamic duo is not enough for Curry to be successful. Put 5 Stephs against 5 KDs, see what happens lol.@warriors @futurefitapp Otto, GP2, JK, most consistent rotation guys all year long? If so, Hopefully, at this point, the dubs will go with these guys, which gives them their best shot at a W until the game is out of reach then go with the other Super Good Non-Rotation Guys: Dubs Regardless https://t.co/7wglu5iizs6/19/2016 👑 @KingJames draft born #nba 39th season beat (30) @StephenCurry30 73 win @warriors 93-89 (58) days before the (39) year mark of the tragic death of the 👑 of rock @ElvisPresley death age (42) 8/16/1977.
