Made Bam his son😂@MiamiHEAT Dipo said it don’t pay? See yaAs a heat fan I think Philly wins since embiid will be a touch better. But miami makes great adjustments and Danny Green isn't going to score like that again. I see Tobias being the savior tonight for Philly's last win of the season https://t.co/XgblElbDLOJust like the suns earlier most everyone is on Philadelphia.

In fact, Boston's focus defensively was limiting what he could do and daring the rest of the Heat to beat them, to which Miami obliged.

Miami won because Bam, Herro, and Dragic specifically torched Boston. https://t.co/AALJQ2U0FF@MiamiHEAT u better win tonight or i am be vewy angieAside from the flopping and foul debacle in this game, the past two games are reminiscent of the bad Heat loss at home on Jan 8 where Miami went nuclear from 3.

Bet slip link: https://t.co/5U6bvUGint https://t.co/iycBtd17Ez@theScore @MiamiHEAT Pj almost lost it 🥺That Miami heat isn’t anything to mess with, and F1 drivers are finding out the hard way 😂Cheesecake Factory then @MiamiHEAT game. Who’s ready? @Cheesecake #HEATCulture #MIAvsPHI@UncleCharles_ Honestly, a lot of it depends on Embiid being fit for tonight's game. If the lineup is out and Embiid isn't in it, I fancy Miami's chances better. Again, Kyle Lowry, also a doubt, can boost the Heat even though Embiid features. That game can swing either way.MIAMI HEAT DONT SELL ME

Can Philly tie things up before heading back to Miami?

https://t.co/jX9wC12htU@nathanmarzion Think about this. A team with @Giannis_An34 did not shoot a free throw in the last 16 minutes of a game where the other team shot 17. Would that happen to Floppin @JoelEmbiid or the fake tough @MiamiHEAT? Or the @Suns or @warriors?

Tucker Brings The Energy, Tyler Herro Brings The Scoring As HEAT Take Game 1 With Second-Half Run | Miami Heat https://t.co/UQkLbywk7SIf you go back and watch game 3, the Heat were getting some good looks. If a few of those fall, and Danny Green doesn’t go nuclear, it’s either a closer game or maybe Miami wins by double digits again. But I know it’s a lot easier to blame one player.@MiamiHEAT https://t.co/ojJNM5QEke the original from @amgreetings@CMarWhiteChoc @raweezzyy As a Heat fan I kinda agree with you. This team could probably win but I wouldn't put any money on it. This is as flawed a Miami Heat team as we've ever had. We're either gonna get blasted now or in the next round. REBUILD NEEDED“Jimmy Butler told me to invest in ‘Big Face Coffee’ for $15 million”: Bam Adebayo dishes on just how much money his Miami Heat co-star asked of him on JJ Redick podcast https://t.co/Bb5UqdaNZVJimmy Butler was the only bright spot for the Heat in Game 3:

Butler:
33 PTS
12-22 FG

Rest of the team:
46 PTS
15-55 FG

Can Miami bounce back and take the 3-1 series lead over Philadelphia tomorrow? 👇 https://t.co/2jYJMB7MK2@kaleypeniche @MiamiHEAT so happy for you!@MiamiHEAT Bro who cut the fucking onionsCompletely awestruck by how many #crypto ads are in the #NBA.

All of the Miami Heat point guards can make 3-pointers.

Often times @raf_tyler tried to be someone he isn’t .@MiamiHEAT @raf_tyler One adjustment he has to make in order to get better as a whole , not just for the next game , is make smarter passes. Someone needs to tell @raf_tyler he plays NBA basketball not street ball - there is no need for the fancy pass attempts every time .@MiamiHEAT I just smashed my oled TV in front guests @my party bc of the game. My wife just took our crying kids &amp; are spending the week@a hotel. This team has ruined my life. Goodbye heat. I am no longer a fan I am taking my fandom 2 the thunder where they know how 2 win chips&amp; not chokeHad at blast spreading the word for our amazing services and closing sales at the F1 event!!!! 🏎💨
