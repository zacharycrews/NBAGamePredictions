New Magic jerseys might’ve sold me...It still pains me that @SHAQ left the @OrlandoMagic.

The problem is literally they just need to make that city version in blue/white/black our full-time jerseys????? 

If you do that, give me an orange alternate jersey idgaf@JcGrady1 @DavidBaumannORL @OrlandoMagic mosley has the players now to get more out of the bench..clearly doesnt have the common sense to rotate and stagger subsAre the new @OrlandoMagic Jersey for sale yet?

That’s going to fuck up the draft pick...@stop2116 @OrlandoMagic @JJudahIsaac why the hell would they rush him back and A) risk winning too many games and B) risk another injury when you can just take your time. This team does NOT need to win this year. Same reason Fultz is out.@DavidBaumannORL @OrlandoMagic Best starters vs Worst bench. Mosley have work to do. Hope Fultz and Isaac would help with that.@easttman @OrlandoMagic I really want to know what goes the the minds of the people in charge of it. “Oh this is what the people wants and looks really good?

He’ll be fine.@DavidBaumannORL @OrlandoMagic It’s been a bit rough, the good thing is Cole looks great, Franz looks solid, Suggs you can see is figuring things out, Mo Bamba is not a bust… but yeah… some stuff needs to be tightened up for SURE!The @OrlandoMagic have a top 3 jersey in nba history, yet they keep making orange alternative jerseys…… get a grip@OrlandoMagic You guys suck so bad at this. Fix the collar ffs.A friend sent me this today… The @OrlandoMagic have 3 of the 8 worst plus-minus marks in the NBA among 427 players. And Terrence Ross is last by a wide margin.

BKN, IND, LAL, LAC, SA, MIN &amp; PHI are some of the other clubs that don't have their geographic identifiers on their City Editions.  The orange didn't come from out of nowhere.@OrlandoMagic @JJudahIsaac When tf is Isaac going to play ? Dude has been out for like 2 years now ?@JakeRakoci @OrlandoMagic It’s just an alternate. But I agree I’m tired of the orange.@OrlandoMagic @jalensuggs Can we win a damn game before we start having to talk about next season already 😡Surely T Ross is worth a prospect or a 1st. A number of teams will be looking at him &amp; he does deserve a run with a contender. What’s a fair trade Magic fans? #orlandomagic #nba  https://t.co/vYejbF3FquYes.

Check out my article below ⬇️ https://t.co/1DuO26ETVY@marcusdj813 @OrlandoMagic So things related to our city shouldn't be on the City Edition? The nickname "The City Beautiful", incorporating the city's flag (that has no orange on it). These things should be disregarded because the color orange? Did you just say the city name shouldn't be on the City jersey@Windmill360 @OrlandoMagic Can we just do this permanently????@OrlandoMagic @MarkelleF @chuma_okeke @The_ColeAnthony yess@OrlandoMagic @JJudahIsaac CLEANN@OrlandoMagic @chuma_okeke YESS@LMized @OrlandoMagic Bad coaching...I don't buy that.

Also, Orlando's in Orange County.@RandyHolbrook @OrlandoMagic To honor Greater Orlando's citrus heritage and Orlando's location in Orange County.@ImMcIlhenny @OrlandoMagic I'm sure the Magic accounted for that with an associated court design.  Stay tuned.Oh wowwwww!!!!! That's all 🧡🖤🧡🖤🧡🖤 #MagicTogether @OrlandoMagic https://t.co/xKkAtAgA5W@BlackLightning5 @OrlandoMagic The lack of commercial groves now has nothing to do with it.  The presence of such groves long before now is part of Greater Orlando's history with citrus.  The Magic is going with the color of the fruit itself, not so much its color.  "Orlando" doesn't have to be on the jersey.@OrlandoMagic @The_ColeAnthony @Timberwolves @BallySportsFL @969thegame He's going to have a strong performance tonight again 💪💪🏀🏀@HoopsTalk13 Offers you the luxury of playing Fultz off the pine and easing him into it. Imagine having @MarkelleF coming on with @TerrenceRoss lighting it up. I think it's the one two sucker punch @OrlandoMagic could really use 👏 #magictogetherThe Orlando Magic should go back to the era of T-Mac uniforms because they are trash now.@ORL_EGW @OrlandoMagic @JJudahIsaac I agree. Super clean. Gotta get oneLove the ball on the shorts @OrlandoMagic !!!
(And the 2000 logo is a bit better also)Two position battles going on within the Orlando Magic at this time: #NBAMagicPolls 

#1 Jalen Suggs and Cole Anthony: One of these guards will be in the starting lineup and one will probably be first off the bench.

 Who do you think starts once Fultz is 100% back Healthy?Does anyone in Orlando actually care that Florida produces oranges? Or want the color orange in a jersey?
