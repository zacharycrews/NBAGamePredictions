Love this Bucks team right now. 9 is a big number and I can see the Kings keeping it close until the 4th, but it just takes 1 run by this Milwaukee team and they can lock it down on defense at any time.Congratulations to Jkdalemu who moved up 21 spots to take #14 on the Milwaukee Bucks team leaderboard.

What do these teams share in common?

It took years for them to build themselves up to be contenders. Prior to that, they experienced early playoff exits. Bulls in a similar situation. More moves must be made.On this day in sports history March 16, New York Knicks Shooting Guard Allan Houston scored 50 Points in a 120-111 win against the Milwaukee Bucks in 2003.@GoDawgsBitch @philly248 @Pjfucker1 @Bucks My guy is scared of Ben Simmons üòÇüòÇüòÇ@sportsiren @nextlevel_03 @WVUhoops @Bucks Wouldn't it be great if there were more players like Jevon.
