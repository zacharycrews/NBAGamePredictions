#NBA https://t.co/EnfoPdwpNYNew @DreamShakeSBN: The Houston Rockets’ losing streak continues as they dropped their 11th straight game in loss to the Phoenix Suns.

https://t.co/DmYKE8hGSt@BiasedHouston @HoustonRockets 
My thoughts,
Green 0-6 in 3pt...
When 3pt shots not connecting, take some perimeter shots.
This will build back your shooting confident!Suns extend win streak with victory over skidding Rockets  #NBA

Actually they don’t have to trade as there are street guys available. Makur. EjOnu   Derick Culver…..The Astros really lost the World Series to make me watch the Davis Mill led Texans and the rebuilding Houston Rockets who are 7-57 in their last 64 games. Wtf@HoustonRockets start playing  josh Christopher@realhoopstalk2 @HoustonRockets He’ll be fine@peakoko @HoustonRockets Okay but the youngsters were making him turn the ball over wtf is your point 😂 I didn't mention this year's stats or assists, I said they were making him mad and making him turn the ball over. Get off your knees broTough times for @HoustonRockets 🙃@HoustonRockets @creditkarma Give him the start at this point, he’s a natural born leader and he can definitely lead this team better than anyone.@HoustonRockets @creditkarma And silas  freezed him on the bench!!@HoustonRockets @creditkarma Only positive rn@HoustonRockets @creditkarma start him@HoustonRockets @kroger @clutchfans   TeamWork.  Silas need to stop a guy to keep shooting 3s if he’s struggling from the perimeter or at least 0-3 and let other players do the 3 point shots however only allow them more perimeter shot if they’re 2-4. those players need to learn from their mistakes@HoustonRockets Dean 44@Rocket4lyfe @HoustonRockets But but but....Green was going to take us over.🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣@HoustonRockets @TilmanJFertitta is the one responsible for this mess@Sixteenhundo @HoustonRockets Exactly 😂@HoustonRockets Love reading the replies 😂😂😂@BiasedHouston @HoustonRockets
