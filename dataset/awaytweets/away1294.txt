If Mr Dillion Brooks doesnt know what Coach Kerr is talking about, unwritten CODE of avoiding substantive injury to other players through intent or flagrant foul, then there is a culture problem with the Memphis Grizzlies !@TheRealMrACL @NBA He’s playing .. this is complete bullshit @nba and the @memgrizz will be fined… it certainly doesn’t take this long for an MRI for a professional sports team@AGreatTimeOut @FOX13Memphis It’s insane! All it takes is one @memgrizz @GrizzliesPR player to publically slam him, and the bozo is fired!If Steve Kerr is right and there is a “code” in the NBA then Steph Curry needs to go out with a season ending injury tonight. @warriors @memgrizz It’s the code.@NBAonTNT @celtics @Bucks @memgrizz @warriors A Must win for grizz and Celtics@jhrogersii @NotoriousOHM I don't know you Sir. But I do know I don't believe a word that comes out of @memgrizz camp. Why not release the MRI? Unless they're still trying to cover their lies about Poole. It makes zero sense.

Bright future ahead of these young players and they already have the league on notice. It's a great time to be a Grizz fanMemphis Grizzlies trying to dictate the narrative by covering up the fact they got 142 pieced with Ja’s “broke the code” injury 🤦‍♀️@memgrizz @warriors @NBAonTNT @929espn Ja carrying rn, Dubs in 5The Warriors beat the Memphis Grizzlies by 30 with Ja!!!

Positive vibes always win let’s go !!!@JackHoo12839456 @GrizzliesPR @memgrizz @warriors Yes, it’s the playoffs but, perhaps naively so, choose to believe the leadership &amp; floor general skills of Tyus Jones will get the Grizzlies back to their “20-5 without Ja” style of play. Without Ja, guys know they must step up &amp; make plays themselves. Can’t defer to Ja anymore.@memgrizz @warriors @NBAonTNT @929espn Another day another lose coming mark my words🤣🤣🤣Good luck to @lucasw2424 as he participates in workouts with the Atlanta Hawks and Memphis Grizzlies this week! 

#OnwardLU https://t.co/mpD3VzTmN7@kirkland8866 @LoriUKBay @JanieMcCAP @TeresaMWalker @memgrizz I can't imagine being this obtuse. Besides relying on when Ja told them, he experienced the pain, all they needed to do, was go back and watch the game. It's obvious. Before JP pulled Ja's knee, he kneed him in it.let’s ride.

A 3-2 would work perfectly there. 2 stays weakside. 1 gets cut &amp; 5 in paint.Game day!! 9PM! I'm sending all the positive vibes to Tyus Stones and hoping Adams gets to play a lot!

Their favorite play is an off ball screen for 3 to the wing. Our 3 &amp; 4 switch, our 5 moves to the paint. Their 5 goes to the stripe. Our 1 is on ball and our 2 is weak side.

We’re all here to watch basketball, and we can’t do that if @memgrizz and their fans are just gonna hurt our guys instead of playing.

He’d be having an MRI if really hurt. This is gamesmanship. And a 50k fine is nothing to an NBA team to keep their opponent off guardIf y’all really think @JaMorant ain’t playing tomorrow then y’all all falling for @memgrizz tactics - smooth play to try and get a suspension but grabbing a knee @KendrickPerkins ain’t going to ‘injure’ that man diving at legs like bane did to Poole or clubbing go2 @Money23Green@JackTullis14 @GrizzliesPR @memgrizz @JaMorant Future is bright for that injury haha@skiddly_bop @SplashCityW @currygawker @memgrizz Yall were tryna get JP ejected for checking on GP2.

Which is good for @warriors because @memgrizz are better without @JaMorant

Let’s not forget how well he did in leading this team in the regular season during Ja’s absence. For a number of reasons, JJJ seems to play better when Morant isn’t on the floor. Let’s go Grizz!@GrizzliesPR @memgrizz @warriors Knee Soreness????? @JaMorant didn't want to be in a game down 30. He'll play on Monday.

Grizzlies coaches and players were whining about this? Talk about " broke the code ".@memgrizz Golden state scared they couldn’t win series without suspending or injuring grizz starters they’ve been doing it for a while now. https://t.co/sA5p8faFoA@bradbotkincbs Yours is not a serious take on what happened. I actually had to look you up and see if you were in the pay of the Memphis Grizzlies. Have you actually watched any basketball games in the last few months?

My friends suggested that it was just because they were young. I felt that it was a culture issue that starts at the top. These past few days have proven me right.@NickStephenson8 @memgrizz We shouldn’t stoop to their level.@memgrizz figured out that they can't beat this @warriors team and started   crybaby drama to deflect from their inadequacies. Some grown-up needs to take @JaMorant aside and explain to him the damage he's doing to his future super star career by cultivating this reputation now. https://t.co/Zm1vB8wsIUListen @JaMorant @RealSkipBayless and @memgrizz !!! I am a GSW fan &amp; I wish Ja is ok and is 100% healthy come the game tomorrow. Fans want to see both teams at their best. It's just sad Brooks took out GP2.

ALL NBA Player are HURTING RIGHT NOW@DamichaelC Believe @memgrizz will start Adams… maybe TJenks didn’t want to meddle with the lineup that worked in Game 2 win but think he’s realized GSW has adjusted and something must change.

You put on this song and dance simply to try getting Poole suspended after you got smoked by the Warriors. Curry has a bleeding hand, Green gets stitches and GP2 gets a broken elbow and you guys pretend that Poole actually injured on that play 🙄The @memgrizz were 20-5 this year without Ja Morant.
