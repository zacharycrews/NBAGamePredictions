STAR+@KingsPosty @SacramentoKings 😂🔥😂tonight it’s on.Flat spot for the Lakers tonight. 
Always look to fade that home team first game back after a long road trip. Sacramento finally got a much needed Win against Portland which surely created some confidence few days back. Take a shot with the Kings +7.5 later tonight #NBATwitter6) Sacramento Kings (Alvin Gentry): Veer - Rip + Pin https://t.co/6zt6A1MVaF@HoopsRumors How in the world can the Sacramento Kings, make anyone on their roster, an “ Untouchable “- They are a mixed up roster, with too many small point guards+ play quite possibly, the worst D in the NBA@milo_wessel @NBCSAuthentic @warriors @SacramentoKings @SFGiants @Athletics @49ers @SanJoseSharks @SJEarthquakes Cute. Like I said they ain’t my Bay Area team that’s why I left they asses out like the niners and giants how hard is it to not understand lol 😂🤦🏽‍♂️@LiteSkinJae @NBCSAuthentic @warriors @SacramentoKings @SFGiants @Athletics @49ers @SanJoseSharks @SJEarthquakes doesnt mean theyre not a bay area team🤣, they won half the championships that the bay area won in the 2010s lmfao@LiteSkinJae @NBCSAuthentic @warriors @SacramentoKings @SFGiants @Athletics @49ers @SanJoseSharks @SJEarthquakes why cuz theyre better than the A’ss?i completely wiped the sacramento kings outta my mind. totally thought the lakers didnt play again until sunday vs detroit. how sad lol.That Marvin Bagley three pointer to ice the game for Sacramento Kings to beat Portland Trailblazers was definitely a shot at fired Coach Luke Wlaton who didnt want anything to do with Bagley. There is a very talented player there just needs to stay healthyDasHaus made a bet!

#sportsbetting #betting #sportspicks #gamblingtwitter #gambling@SacramentoKings Just a thought the best teams the Kings have had consistently is with Rick Alderman and Dave Joerger who had Elston Turner as the lead assistant. Please tell me why coach Turner hasn’t been given a Head coaching offer?If the Kings can pull of one butt kicking this season. Please let it be tonight. Just a simple 25 point win will do. Come on Sacramento turn it up!@KlydeNt9 @shazutheraider @Playoff_PJ @GreatestKaren @FanMahome @statmuse @SacramentoKings Keep in mind all the HOFers he’s coached https://t.co/9X79CzCv5OLos Angeles Lakers - Sacramento Kings İddaa Tahmini 27.11.21

However, I remember Sacramento had a game in the '90s. What I found odd was I believe it was not televised nationally or even on 31, which used to carry Kings games before NBC Sports California.
