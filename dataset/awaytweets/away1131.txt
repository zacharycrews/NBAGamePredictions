Second Same Game Parlay of the night is in the Pistons v Nets matchup! For Brooklyn: Drummond gets a double-double, KD and Kyrie have nice nights offensively as well.

If OKC loses out (including Friday vs Detroit), then the Pistons just have to beat Indiana. OKC &amp; Detroit would both have 22 wins.

And maybe Houston beats the Kings twice. Could be a three way for #3.Big swat from Beef Stew ❌✋

Pistons aren't really a franchise NBA fans at large are all that interested in UNLESS THEY'RE WINNING.

If you weren't around for Goin to Work, I don't know why the Detroit Pistons would be appealing outside of the Detroit part.Tough comparing Lions loyalty to anything in Detroit sports. Foks are tricked into believing every year — even knowing they'll bomb.

The Pistons are historically great, but they were so irrelevant + bad between Goin to Work and SVG that they fell by the wayside. Just a fact. https://t.co/Gs62AMiYBt(BPRW) CHILDREN TO LEADERS INC.
