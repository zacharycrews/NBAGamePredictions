Check out a few other notes surrounding our road trip wrap up game ⬇️ https://t.co/yjWk1WXLT1Last season's Miami road game was one of my favorite W's.

Heat had the perfect gameplan for Doncic, forcing him to go right,Bam played great individual defense, and still Luka hit some extremly tough shots.

THJ was red hot, scored 30+ pts, Green was solid from the bench.@MiamiHEAT Fuck no, you better a team of top men this year. https://t.co/lJXDgVLmwLI’ll post some free NBA for tonight too!

He simply is not settling on being a one trick pony and buying in, love it.Heat -140 (2U) 🔥:

Would’ve liked this at even but couldn’t grab line til now

Miami 3rd in points/game (114), Dallas 28th in points/game (98.3)

Miami 4th in offensive efficiency, Dallas 27th

Miami ranks 1st in points allowed (97.0), think Dallas will struggle all night

Hulk in real life! 😱😱😱@Lefty_Jew I haven't seen Miami Vice in a while, either, but I remember it being entertaining if similarly melodramatic and unrealistic. Better sense of place than Heat (I lived in L.A. for 14 years and nah) and a lot less ponderous at a full 30 minutes shorter. Pacino overacts, too.the Miami Heat should look into trading for Lou Will cause he should be on a title contender if this is indeed his last season. #NBA75@MiamiHEAT @AmericanAir Bring back the Miami Floridians jersey@therealsupes @MiamiHEAT excellent, we are all excited for you.@statmuse @MiamiHEAT @JimmyButler Kyle Lowry's fat ass is worth more than making stupid memes about hih?@janhoffmann3d @DisneyStudios @MiamiHEAT @OffWht More like Donald Swag@TheRewatchables … ok Mann on the pod ….

Only game he was bad was in gm 5. So idk what u talking about, sounds like excuses. Maybe accept the fact the team around him isn’t good enough..?🦃 ¡A defender nuestra casa!
