The Grizzlies are in Philadelphia to play the Sixers who will be without Embiid, who is being sat for rest. Without Embiid, I don't see the Sixers keeping up with all-star Ja Morant. The Grizzlies are 17-8 ATS on the road this season. Take Memphis.15% OFF w/code:BIGONFIVE

Wizards challenged it and won. Foul rescinded. Alley-oop counted.@Nayps @jeffpearlman @memgrizz Yeah, that isnt good.@SLAMonline @memgrizz Special talent@yungfundipp @ndr3wz @TheNBACentral Hawks kinda did but I think they back next year. Look at the Memphis Grizzlies that’s the perfect formula to rebuild. Fast and simple with a true franchise player in Ja. I get it not everyone is them thoI'm not sure if I have even a 12" vertical jump (I soar like an elephant 🐘). 44" is mind-boggling.  I hope to one day see @JaMorant soar from 16 feet away and destroy the rim with a Ja-dropping dunk! @memgrizz
