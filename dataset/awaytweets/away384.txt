Toronto Raptors vs New York Knicks.@stephenasmith @nyknicks Dude I actually respect a lot of your takes, but if you’re truly a supporter of the orange and blue you’ll stop stirring up drama for the team.  Our start last year (beyond it being a surprise) was worse, stay patient.  RJ and Randle not using their right is absolute nonsense.@stephenasmith @nyknicks You have no idea. Your team is garbage 🤣🤣🤣How do you get to @nyknicks games? https://t.co/V82OlrSGLv@stephenasmith @nyknicks Well you nailed it, the knicks “Ain’t dat dam goot”@stephenasmith @nyknicks How much did you have on them, or was it the last leg of your Multi?Drake and Kanye ended their beef. Hey @nyknicks, y’all up?@MsMJsays @nyknicks Nah we gonna need a trade to fix this up. We need a superstar/star player. Randle is good but he's not a star. We need better than what we have@stephenasmith @nyknicks Relax, 2023 will be the year of The Knicks! It has to take 50 years. Be patient!@iamBenLyons look what I dug up out of the closet!

Stars in each free agent class not even looking our direction. KD ditched Knicks and said “Knicks not cool” and went across the street to BK. Media and everybody laughing at Knicks.

How bout them Steelers 😂@johnnyjohnjon83 @MsMJsays @nyknicks He is really soft and cant get on track. Mostly because the offense is broken and it runs thru Randle. If we had a modern offense with a quality PG, he might thrive, he is a shooter after all.@gregarmstrong01 @NYMag @nyknicks Think I have about 30 only lol KNICKS that is@gregarmstrong01 @NYMag @nyknicks 200 Knicks jerseys?@stephenasmith @nyknicks Preach@stephenasmith @nyknicks What can go wrong will go wrong.

They playing like trash. The fact you comparing raptors in this is crazy. They are the 4th youngest team. Don’t expect them to do good. Knicks are expected to do good. And yes pacers are playing like trash although they were never that goo@nyknicks trade kemba walker and Kevin Knox for John wall@MsMJsays @nyknicks I agree they just need to tighten up their defense Mitchell Robinson needs to get in shape so you can chase these guys out by the three-point line@stephenasmith @nyknicks Love this guynext 5 games for the Celtics

#Betting #FreePicks https://t.co/Zu7yZiA1zM@aldea_cervantes @nyknicks I agree. He doesn’t come off as smooth , slick or particularly athletic, but he has big time desire and ability to improve@johnnyjohnjon83 @MsMJsays @nyknicks I think it kinda makes Thibs looks bad especially if this doesn’t work out.

I like Burks but not as your main PG. last night they had issues with just getting the ball half court and getting into their offense.

More teams probably to follow that same strategy of pressing us.@StabTheCrab @rads619 I live in New York, trust me if you are just a miserable person over the Knicks and Giants so be it. I’m just saying that has to get annoying at some point.@KnicksBig15 @johnnyjohnjon83 @nyknicks Right? Something ain’t right.@stephenasmith @nyknicks O NO HE DIDNT  Mr A waiting my brother need ur input 💯💯💯💯💯💯💯🙏🙏🙏@KnicksBig15 @MsMJsays @nyknicks Yeah.. Kemba doesn’t fit the coach unfortunately@yankeefan0223 @esturm96 @stephenasmith @nyknicks @AndrewLiv Kemba and Fournier were trash last season. Randle only had 2 good season and it was because there were no audience like now@YannFromThere @nyknicks You are there to sell tickets and put fans in the stands.@MsMJsays @johnnyjohnjon83 @nyknicks Yea…..ah I don’t know, it’s just weird.

They do this whole welcome back home thing during the summer and Kemba in all these Knicks commercials and Thibs benched him just a month into the season.

Just weird.@stephenasmith @nyknicks Settle down, my goodness🙄🙄🙄🙄 https://t.co/dL5s0TzMEx@weareinthistog9 @nyknicks Pretty sure Ricky Davis did it back in the day.@JoelGlenn @camtheknicksfan @nyknicks @KnicksNetwork @Knicks_SNOB @letstalknicks @ProjectNerdHQ @NY_KnicksPR @KnicksCentral You’re not reading close enough. Since they announced Kemba out, they’ve allowed 127 a game (which is by far worst defense in the league).

So, they haven’t improved defensively since benching Kemba.@stephenasmith @nyknicks They’re overrated.  Go Bulls.@KnicksBig15 @johnnyjohnjon83 @nyknicks I didn’t like it either. Not down with the public shaming of it all. So that could be part of larger behind the scene issues.@KnicksBig15 @camtheknicksfan @nyknicks @KnicksNetwork @Knicks_SNOB @letstalknicks @ProjectNerdHQ @NY_KnicksPR @KnicksCentral Not the first few games.@nyknicks @obitoppin1 Get some wins on repeat.@MsMJsays @johnnyjohnjon83 @nyknicks Anyway I’m okay with occasional bad game (happens) but when it extends to more than a game then it’s more of an issue.

We have a few issues.

And I don’t know about with y’all but I still don’t feel right with whole Kemba benching (doesn’t seem like our team is better as well).@stephenasmith @nyknicks Literally me when I watch this years Lakers team. Lol I feel this pain https://t.co/QTc4fcIxvN@Jane_Doe82 Mine,

That’s an odd one. Usually seafood is a culprit. But I’ve worked through bronchitis/pneumonia &amp; through radiation so I’m not the most sympathetic to the sick excuse.@KnicksBig15 @MsMJsays @nyknicks An okay, yeah Fournier said he had bad steak in San Antonio@MsMJsays @johnnyjohnjon83 @nyknicks Nah RJ already fine and playing better. It was something related to like last week.@KnicksBig15 @johnnyjohnjon83 @nyknicks I hope not the Covid…@MsMJsays @johnnyjohnjon83 @nyknicks These are multi multi millionaire athletes. Shouldn’t they have access to the finest chefs?

Weird to hear all these food excuses.@johnnyjohnjon83 @MsMJsays @nyknicks He had some kinda food poisoning reportedly. Maybe not steak but something food wise.@johnnyjohnjon83 @KnicksBig15 @nyknicks Yes &amp; then Thibs let loose on that.@KnicksBig15 @johnnyjohnjon83 @nyknicks I don’t know where they’re eating that they’re getting bad steak.@KnicksBig15 @MsMJsays @nyknicks I didn’t see RJ talk about bad steak though? RJ looked sick af for a minute lol@johnnyjohnjon83 @nyknicks He’s not real popular right now. He needs to sit down &amp; hush.@johnnyjohnjon83 @MsMJsays @nyknicks Gotcha. I also heard he joined RJ with the ‘bad steak’ 🥩 excuse too. Although I think RJ had a legit issue of it.@johnnyjohnjon83 @KnicksBig15 @nyknicks I’ve seen him compared to crappy Bargs so you know his remarks didn’t go over well. Being compared to Bargs is the worst insult you can give a player b@MsMJsays @nyknicks Not just the steak thing too.. like this fucker is on a private jet, private airport, in a 5 star hotel, he don’t have to carry his bags, he’s not a regular person smh@KnicksBig15 @MsMJsays @nyknicks Man’s talking “how do you prepare for a game like that” and “special circumstances” “back to back” “getting in very late”.. bro no one wants excuses, back to backs happen all the time in the nba he’s been in the league 9 years and what he’s never had a back where he got in late?@johnnyjohnjon83 @nyknicks Yes the bad steak turned a lot of people off.@DukeDrizzyNYC @nyknicks See this is the problem. We’d probably have to give up half the team to land someone.@stephenasmith @nyknicks Easy does it Brick!New York Knicks: The NY Knicks need to get creative by going old school https://t.co/yPycZpJF2c@johnnyjohnjon83 @MsMJsays @nyknicks What did he say?@MsMJsays @nyknicks Tbh I want Fournier gone, his whole excuse making BS really turned me off.. he’s the opposite of what this Knicks team should be and the opposite of the type of players we fell in love with on this team.. this is a big L on Leon, Perry, Wes, and Thibbs@MsMJsays @nyknicks You are right because it surely will include Barrett and several drafts picks and probably Mitchell who I don’t really want to lose 😔Amare stoudemire of the Phoenix suns #amarestoudemire #nbaallstar #phoenixsuns #newyorkknicks #powerforward #powerforwards #dallasmavs #dallasmavericks #newyorkknickerbockers #miamiheat https://t.co/kncJgxw8aF@DukeDrizzyNYC @nyknicks But what we would have to give up concerns me.@RollingStone “Winning Time”: Reggie Miller vs. The New York Knicks”.
