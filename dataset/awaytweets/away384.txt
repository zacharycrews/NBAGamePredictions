I like Burks but not as your main PG. last night they had issues with just getting the ball half court and getting into their offense.

More teams probably to follow that same strategy of pressing us.@StabTheCrab @rads619 I live in New York, trust me if you are just a miserable person over the Knicks and Giants so be it.

So, they haven‚Äôt improved defensively since benching Kemba.@stephenasmith @nyknicks They‚Äôre overrated.  Go Bulls.@KnicksBig15 @johnnyjohnjon83 @nyknicks I didn‚Äôt like it either.
