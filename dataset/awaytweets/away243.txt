Brooklyn has found some traction offensively. But Orlando is communicating really well on defense with their switches. Still holding a good lead.They Doubling Suggs..... ü§£ ü§£ ü§£

Yes, you read that score correctly. Orlando is on a roll, shooting over 60% from the floor.

Averaging 11.5 per game, Jalem Suggs already has 17 tonight. He's 4/4 from downtown.40 in a quarter to the Magic. The Orlando. Magic. https://t.co/MXgy884voeIt‚Äôs understandable that the Nets are struggling offensively while so shorthanded. There are few shooters on the floor. 25 points is acceptable.

Allowing 41 points to the Orlando Magic with a Nets lineup that heavily leans defense is unacceptable.

41-25 Magic lead after 1Q.Ok so the Orlando magic are the fucking dream team now????? 17 points from jalen Suggs in the 1st quarter???? 10 from Bamba??? Are you serious?????OH MY @jalensuggs!!!!! #orlando #magic #MagicTogether #jalen #suggsWhy are we getting cooked by Orlando magic ü§®Dam @OrlandoMagic are running @BrooklynNets so far without KD.
