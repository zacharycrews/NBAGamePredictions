#MILvsPHI | #FearTheDeer https://t.co/FVScv4N4v3On this date in NBA history, Dale Ellis of the Seattle SuperSonics set the NBA record for most minutes played in a game (69) in a 5OT loss at the Milwaukee Bucks, 155 - 154.

Teammate Xavier McDaniel played 68 minutes during the same game.

Ellis scored 53 points.

2 Timothy 1:7A CNN poll finds most Americans say President Biden isn't paying attention to the nation's most important issues. That’s hard to believe when just yesterday Joey B welcomed the NBA champion Milwaukee Bucks to the White House.Effort on the boards for missed 3s. Need inside scoring option when Giannis is doubled in the lane. Wings are failing on shots at the rim, need trailers to clean up. Milwaukee Bucks: 3 takeaways from ugly loss to Washington Wizards https://t.co/38HNQFZmk6On this date in 1989, Dale Ellis (@dale_ellis3d) set the NBA-record for minutes played in a single game with 69. 

Nice. 

The @Bucks and Sonics went to five overtimes and despite Ellis' 53 points—Milwaukee won the game 155-154.
