https://t.co/bVWH4Av1bs@fuzzysimpleton7 @Barlowe500 @trailblazers EJ Liddell would be an awesome fit in Portland. He takes pressure off of everybody else on the court bc he can do a little bit of everything &amp; does most of those things very efficiently.Billy Ray Bates scored career-high 34 pts in loss for @trailblazers.  Sadly it was his last playoff game as #Blazers didn’t make playoffs in 82 and he was waived prior to 82/83 season. The 28.3 pts Bates avg in series was teams best until @Dame_Lillard topped it in 2021 w/34.3 https://t.co/6wnNxhmKyW@craighofeld has made a pick for @okcthunder vs. @trailblazers
