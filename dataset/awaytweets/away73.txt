Bagley is needed. #BullsNationas an honest sacramento kings fan, we are wasting rishaun holmes. we need to trade him to a real franchise like the chicago bullsTonight’s matchup against the struggling Pelicans (1-4) is a big early test for this Sacramento Kings team.

It’s the first game Sacramento is favored in &amp; moral victories mean nothing. Gotta add to the win column.

Limiting Valancuinas and dealing with his size will be crucial.Thank you @TheCityofSac!

It’s right thing to do. @oaktownbiz510 did some videos thanks to @CarlaCollins510 @regionbiz @AngeliqueAshby that talked about what you asked for w/ Sacramento’s experience w/ @SacramentoKings, @Golden1Center, @docosacramento &amp; Natomas reuse. #BiggerThanBaseball https://t.co/7qB8l0R4h5Is this season’s @NBA @Lakers team similar to keeping the designated hitter in baseball? 😂 @SHAQ @Money23Green @warriors @SacramentoKings @Suns @LAClippers@KangzDraft @Kings_Insight homie theyre in sacramento lol, u gotta let it happen@damienbarling @E_DUB916 @sillysillysill I don't think you will see anything attributed directly to him. It was more so a general Sacramento Kings organizational statement when they were selling citizens on the need for a new arena. Folks put two and two together since he is the controlling partner.Here is my reaction/rant on the Phoenix Suns UGLY loss to the Sacramento Kings last night losing 110-107 on Harrison Barnes game-winner. Here is my video on Suns Geek #Suns #NBA #ValleyProud https://t.co/mI8ijJU8m3@damienbarling @E_DUB916 @sillysillysill D, the Sacramento Kings and former Mayor Johnson publicly floated the idea of bringing back the Monarchs when discussions of a new arena and its potential uses and tenants outside of Kings basketball were discussed. It can probably be found in a Google search.Everytime the warriors get a good run

Sacramento Kings have ANKR as sponsor…@heykevinjohn @SeanCunningham I don’t know if your @TEGNA counterpart, @LWashingtonTV at @12News, saw this one coming, but in case you all missed it, I caught the @hbarnes buzzer beater in-person, Wednesday Night at the @FootprintCNTR that gave the @SacramentoKings a 110-107 win. https://t.co/NfGIiKGXRE@SacramentoKings Why do you mute such a great call like cmon now that’s a little much.
