As I said; lifetime Raptors fan from Vancouver Island &amp; I called you a Gangster.  We all know Veerman could also buy 1000 Pascal momies, I respect your hustle a ton, as a small time collector still chasing to complete the Raptors set. You both leaders on the platform.@KingDragonNFT @nbatopshot @pskills43 @Raptors @TheJurassicPack Definitely@intangible_eth @cwh812 @TopDaady @ElDumboTS @Raptors Tbh I probably wouldn’t be able to make it to most games anyway. So I won’t fight you hard there. Inflexible work schedule and being in Saskatchewan makes it tough to get out to games.Should be an interesting night in Cleveland tonight. Good luck Toronto Raptors. On the plus side, I’m excited to see what Dalano Banton looks like in 40+ minutes https://t.co/PwUuJ9kdKP@cwh812 @TopDaady @ElDumboTS @KingDragonNFT @Raptors Some clarity on this point would help @ElDumboTS and how much notice I'd need to retake that #1 spot. For courtside seats, the gloves will come off.@TopDaady @cwh812 @intangible_eth @ElDumboTS @Raptors Most of my account value is not in commons 🙂 But the rest I agree with. I also have every Raptors legendary and rare. Those are worth much more. I’m collecting in a way that’s fun for me. No end game here, just enjoying myself and achieving collecting goals@TopDaady @intangible_eth @ElDumboTS @KingDragonNFT @Raptors Raptors leaderboard mighty come with benefits of some sort. About a month ago Roham said he could envision the top collector of each team getting courtside seats. If CS is the measure of this then Dragon is in the lead.@Raptors @TangerineHoops Ahh I can’t wait@cwh812 @intangible_eth @ElDumboTS @KingDragonNFT @Raptors Win what?

Dragon has all of his value in Raptors commons. Which as a Raps fan is gangster and hilarious, but Veerman has an account that dwarfs anything dragon can make happen.
