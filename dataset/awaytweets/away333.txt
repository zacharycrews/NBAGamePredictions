Mark Price and Brad Daugherty are on pins and needles watching their record....

@cavs@CIickingbuttons @IamGurrajSingh @NBA @okcthunder @cavs @joshgiddey @evanmobley im sorry that you think mobley is a better defender then jarret allen right now i didn't realize you were that dumb.. your just not accounting for how much Jarret allen affects his game he shot 0 for 11 that's not just a bad shooting night he was assKiss.

Only players I would want to trade right now are Sexton, Wade, and maybe Windler and Cedi (depending on the return player).@dbaker012 @DreKnott @cavs Maybe compare them to WCW’s Hall and Nash@cavs @evanmobley @Kia Sign him to a 50 year contract now.@MrZZZ30 @ZMoureiden @digitalpoet @notd_ray @NBA @okcthunder @cavs @joshgiddey @evanmobley Man I've had so many comments on this post and another one from earlier i had on the same situation these raptor fans are a hard bunch but us cavs fans ain't backing down that's why they lost a few weeks ago and will later down the line to us😈.@CenturyOG @NBA @okcthunder @cavs @joshgiddey @evanmobley Where’s you boy Suggs, little guy? 

Wasn’t Barnes suppose to be Teri me compared to him?

Honestly it’s been a pleasure watching you collect Ls ever since Barnes was drafted. Just get over the bit, Barnes is terrific - why not just enjoy being a fan, as you claim to be.I told @cavsalcorn during our interview on @wtam1100 to trademark “Holy Mobley!” You know it will land on a T-shirt soon (@GVartwork). @cavs #LetEmKnow@Dylan_Morrow @digitalpoet @TKay_14 @NBA @okcthunder @cavs @joshgiddey @evanmobley I've actually watched 3 or 4 because i have league pass, have u tuned into any cavs games🤡@ZMoureiden @digitalpoet @Kam7803 @notd_ray @NBA @okcthunder @cavs @joshgiddey @evanmobley Well right now he shows as a negative defender. I said he was good for a "Rookie". Mobley is elite period. In the end in excited for Scottie and am glad he is thriving. Apparently the Cavs had a trade worked out for him if he dropped to 6. Good luck Raptor fan!@LegionHoops @IanBegley Send him back to @cavs where it all started@icecoldmjc @ClevelandBred2 @NBA @okcthunder @cavs @joshgiddey @evanmobley For sure, I think it could go either way but the Cavs’ success with Mobley on the floor definitely validates this selection, just a bit off putting to see it go the other way again in terms of recognition but that isn’t (shouldn’t be) directed at Mobley

Y’all got a great one@mariuscojocaruu @A7exG @NBA @okcthunder @cavs @joshgiddey @evanmobley Big yes@dbaker012 @cavs Interesting comparison…. They are both awesome young quiet talented men. I’m hesitant to compare them to anyone just yet.Love watching @kevinlove enjoy this ride. @cavs are best cleveland team since ‘95/97 Indians@cavs @_bigjayy_ I would say so! https://t.co/RICEY1oKX2@cavsalcorn @cavs @wtam1100 @dmansworld474 HOLY MOBLEY!!!!!.....   POW!!!!@trailblazers I think @trailblazers &amp; @Seahawks are headed for #NuclearWinter , a catastrophe like the fate of @cavs...decades without hopes of any glory.
#Nepotism kills competence , #PaulAllenTrust fails
#NeilOlshey fails.
#JodyAllen doesn't know she fails.
@nba @TrailBlazersPR @blazersedge https://t.co/FOWyErgg1c@cavsalcorn @cavs @wtam1100 Tim was awesome!!!!@dmansworld474 @cavs They are really fun to watch! We relocated to NJ and try go to the games whenever they play the 76ers, Knicks, or Nets. We were at the game when Rubio scored 37.@CIickingbuttons @NBA @okcthunder @cavs @joshgiddey @evanmobley That has never been case before. If defence is what they looking for then Mitchell would been rookie of the month. They always look at the offense side plus defence@cavs @evanmobley he thinking he's probably going to the nets for kyrie 😂@Kam7803 @TKay_14 @NBA @okcthunder @cavs @joshgiddey @evanmobley Bruh shut up you prolly haven’t watched many Raps games. Scottie has been the best player or top 3 player on the team most nights. His impact is forreal but no one gives a shit bc he plays in Toronto. He got robbed no way around it Evan has been great but Barnes got finessed..Evan Mobley named KIA @nba Eastern Conference rookie of the month.

The First Cavaliers rookie to win the award since 2013

I hear what you saying but I ain't listening.@OGTheGoat3 @CIickingbuttons @IamGurrajSingh @NBA @okcthunder @cavs @joshgiddey @evanmobley Uh he actually does defend guard off pick n rolls so you’re wrong@cavs @MoreForYou_CLE @evanmobley He deserves  it 👏@frshouttanames @Shamelessjt @AC38529843 @cavs 🤣🤣 I can see last nights loss still got you in your feelings. It's okay to be sad.I’m working but I wish I was going to the @cavs game Sunday 🏀The Cleveland Cavaliers are going to be primed for LeBron to sign a 1 year contract with before retiring. Garland, Sexton, LeBron, Mobley, Allen…GG@CIickingbuttons @Kam7803 @TKay_14 @NBA @okcthunder @cavs @joshgiddey @evanmobley Scottie has to guard the best offensive players on the other team, and guards 1 to 5. Is Mobley guarding guys like Tatum, Harden and Morant?@DreKnott Since you have been around the @cavs does Jarrett Allan and Evan Mobley remind you of Duncan and Robinson.@frshouttanames @Shamelessjt @AC38529843 @cavs We're well on the way. Don't worry bout that #LetEmKnowCleveland Cavaliers vs Miami Heat (2021-12-01):

Ricky Rubio's +38 is tied for the 2nd highest +/- in a game this season

#NBA #NBA75 #NBATwitter #BeTheFight https://t.co/drDAt9vQB7@BobbyBurnerNBA @cavs @evanmobley Using a burner? 😂This is the best non LeBron @cavs team since 199_? 

#LetEmKnow@Sxne19iv2 Have you heard of the Cleveland Cavaliers?@dan_the_man_018 @cavs @evanmobley @BallySportsCLE IPTV, from Iceland, 15 a month@216optimist @cavs RIGHT https://t.co/RllrOVGkifCleveland Cavaliers have been outstanding performers this season with a 12-10 record in the Eastern Conference (6th)

They rank 3rd in DEF rating (104.1) and have played the: 

MOST games vs teams ABOVE .500 (18 games: 8-10 record)

LEAST games vs teams BELOW .500 (4 games: 4-0) https://t.co/YxRAdUEMpj@cavs @rickyrubio9 Rrrrrrricky Rrrrrrrubio@frshouttanames @Shamelessjt @AC38529843 @cavs So pathetic that we beat the breaks off your team lol 😂@NBA @cavs What's so scary, I'm sorry people this is not the best they can play... this is just the beginning.@NBA @okcthunder @cavs @joshgiddey @evanmobley I’m honestly not surprised since the NBA hates @Raptors 🤷‍♂️ #Facts https://t.co/fv6Em3D7Lx@DreKnott @AkronJackson Friend, you’re doing a hellava job with the @cavs ! They are fun to watch again, and I’m beyond excited that we have a team that’s showing the NBA “what you won’t do, is act like you have the win locked up”!#LetEmKnow #TheBigsAreBack@SpainandFitz need more @cavs love on this show!@JoeScalzo01 @cavs Browns are sucking wind….@NBA @okcthunder @cavs @joshgiddey @evanmobley Wow y’all really robbed Scottie Eh smfh I’m not even surprised if this guy played for any team other than Toronto he’d get the respect he deserves. Straight robbery.@LegionHoops @IanBegley Bring him back @cavs@frshouttanames @Shamelessjt @AC38529843 @cavs So what he did again that's 2016 where we at now? I don't live in the past I'm focused on the now. And right now the Cavs are damn good without lbj@harshabey @ClevelandBred2 @NBA @okcthunder @cavs @joshgiddey @evanmobley Also, the fact that the Cavs are already nearing as many wins as most people predicted them to get for the whole year.@cavs @evanmobley Congrats Evan!!@dmansworld474 @cavs They would probably have a better record if we hadn’t lost Lauri, Mobley, and JA for over a week.@Rickonia @cavs This is me every time I watch them! #LetEmKnow #TheBigsAreBack https://t.co/Iowrz7UHJR@harshabey @ClevelandBred2 @NBA @okcthunder @cavs @joshgiddey @evanmobley That makes sense. But the stats between Barnes and Mobley are nearly identical. Hard to ignore the intangibles and advanced stats when the traditional stats are so close.@frshouttanames @Shamelessjt @AC38529843 @cavs And your sitting there saying we aren't better but completely destroyed Miami. It was an ass whooping of beauty. And it's no fluke we have done it to many of the play off teams already@frshouttanames @Shamelessjt @AC38529843 @cavs And what we do to your heat? Yeah u had 2 injuries but even with bam and Jimmy Cavs were taking that gameTalking @cavs on @wtam1100 at 8:05 tonite with @dmansworld474 and there’s a lot to chat about.

They be calling Collin Sexton daddy! Gtfoh@MrZZZ30 @digitalpoet @Kam7803 @notd_ray @NBA @okcthunder @cavs @joshgiddey @evanmobley scottie actually guards the best player on the other side most of the game not for moments@frshouttanames @Shamelessjt @AC38529843 @cavs And your in Georgia so I mean the Cavs are better than your hawks. Lol so you got no room to be up in here debating nothing.Never more then a KING that brought the @Cavs a  championship @KingJames #TheGOAT https://t.co/Hfit1NfXDy@216optimist @cavs Right man. Ignorant ppl. Yes he is lebron. Yes he won us a ring. Yes that was in the past. NO we do not need him on this team to be successful@SkrticX @cavs @trailblazers @Cleveland_PL But in a few years, Portland Would jell,becoming one of the NBA’s iconic teams, if only briefly.
