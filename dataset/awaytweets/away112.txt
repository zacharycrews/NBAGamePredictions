Former Atlanta Hawks guard Brandon Goodwin's career is likely over due to blood clots from the vaccine! You'll conveniently ignore him, though. https://t.co/XFLBfESgWuMaybe he should reach out to Atlanta Hawks guard Brandon Goodwin, since we're playing the anecdote game. He's out for the season due to blood clots from the vaccine, and his career could possibly be over. https://t.co/sY3HZbXECEAtlanta Hawks 🆚
