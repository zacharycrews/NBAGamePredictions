Please forgive me@kelwright    Roar!!!!!!!   @memgrizz https://t.co/BVBm0s2s9l@willcoleman1988 The Memphis Grizzlies are 13-2 without Ja Morant so I guess that same knowledge applies to them as well? That Emoni Bates is a future NBA lottery pick he is 6”9 with his athleticism why not play him more minutes. Soon as he was subbed in he instantly provided a spark 3 pointer.
