At 6'7"/180, McGowens has great positional size at the wing. Long arms. Aggresive slasher. Makes a lot of plays OTD. Gets to the free throw line at will.

Perfect development project for a rebuilding Portland. https://t.co/WLUpyJOsHK@abbylynneickert @AnferneeSimons @trailblazers @PinwheelEmpire ❤️🖤❤️🖤 Miss Sissy https://t.co/QQRLZ8Elq6#Portland Trail Blazers: 17.5 PPG
