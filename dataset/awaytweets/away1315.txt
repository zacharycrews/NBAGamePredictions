We don't deserve to be on the same court as the @celtics, let alone the @warriors.@MiamiHEAT @ATT I understand Lowry starting tbh…he can bring the ball up, put everyone in their spots and relieve the playmaking duties from Jimmy. But he’ll be a HUGE liability on defense and scoring.Let’s do this @MiamiHEAT 🔥🔥 #HEATCulture https://t.co/PX7lkwtaCz@MiamiHEAT @ATT I’m I the only person that is aware of Strus’ stat line this series?

I know this is an away game, but I don’t think this team is done yet. I think they keep it close #GamblingTwitter@NBA @MiamiHEAT Miami have no special player, they function as a unit , a special player o two is what they need to dominate the playoffs, but Celtics are going to be kings of the eastI have Celtics to win the series +105 pending (bet after game 1), as well as Celtics -1.5 games +105 series spread (bet before series began).

A wise move would be to bet Miami Heat ML +350 for Game 6 if you’ve been following.

https://t.co/LG6BFJJaGZ@NBA @MiamiHEAT People  are you just  commting or did you read what are they saying ?@17Ringz And Celtics were walked to like 2 games in Boston with 40 more attempts than Miami, 27-5 advantage though HEAT had more paint points. But that isn't used against Tatum. And unlike Harden, Jimmy is efficient from field- need the Miami Heat to level up against Celtics tonight. 

  if Tatum's team gets to the final, it'd take heaven for Warriors to defeat them.@reed_lines And tonight we smash Eric..... Plus eight ....

THATS OUT THE MUD💯@statum106 @neilbelieves I think I like the idea of pairing Miami Vice with Friedkin as opposed to, say, another similar Michael Mann film (i.e. Heat). There are aesthetic similarities for sure but I think they both also contain fairly nuanced critiques of police intervention.Miami shot 0-for-11 on Wednesday when Robert Williams contested a field goal attempt. He played 27 minutes and had 6 points and 10 rebounds. That's if he plays in Game 6.

This series is over as long as Boston can stay in a deep drop. Miami has to take 3s and live with the results.

But man, this series should motivate Bam Adebayo to get in the lab and develop a perimeter game.#NBA #NBAPlayoffs

Every single loss they had this postseason was because of poor performances. I havent seen the Heat play great and then lose.

Finals, no team’s had more disparity of calls &amp; free throw attempts than @MiamiHEAT to @celtics. Over last 3 gms, Cs have averaged 17 more trips to FT line than MIA. How? Both teams shot poorly gm 4&amp;5 but, FTs helped Cs. Refs cannot decide outcomeI am 26-12 in the NBA playoffs and would love to put out a play on tonight's Heat-Celtics game. Can't do it. Not seeing any value to the line/total, nor knowing status of Tyler Herro, Miami's best shot creator. How any 'capper can put out a huge play on this game is beyond me.@ClutchPointsApp The disrespect of the @MiamiHEAT. @ESPN is a total clown network.

He has a slower release, depends on multiple screens &amp; when we get tunnel vision for facilitating a shot and don’t get it for him, are left with 5-8 seconds on the clock.

#UvaldeMassacreI’m at an all time high and ready for the Miami Heat to ruin it@Zachppp I am a long time Miami Heat fan for 27 years. Bam is an amazing player, but Spo and all other Heat fans keep forgetting that he is only 6'9" with 7'3" wingspan. He is very limited when it comes to play against big players.All these talk shows already speaking into existence Boston vs Gsw is going to pissed off all the players of Miami Heat. I know they see this. Jimmy and Bam about to have that look in their Eyes🔥🔥 I know Pat Riley is going to give them a strong talk to. #Heatculture@MiamiHEAT we wounded but  This organization doesn’t make no excuses we bringing it tonight by comity 🔥🔥🏀@JosephSakran @TheDemCoalition @SteveKerr @warriors @KingJames @MiamiHEAT @celtics @NBA @Yankees @RaysBaseball Hey @Avalanche I know you guys care about this!@MiamiHEAT Not even worried heat in 7@CarlosGSmith @MiamiHEAT Yes - they are‼️Gameday‼️ (1) Miami Heat at (2) Boston Celtics face off in game 6 with the Celtics leading 3-2.

#NBAPlayoffs #ECFIt is great that the Miami Heat organization gives a shot to so many players that others wouldn’t, but relying on those guys too much won’t result in a championship, which is exactly why other teams overlooked those players.The Miami Heat are close yet far from winning a championship and are going to have to retool that roster in order to get Jimmy Butler more consistent help.@TylerL349 @MiamiHEAT That would really be nice. 🤞🏼Marco Rubio Furious that Miami Heat Announce Call to Action Prior to Game https://t.co/Blh8zOE5Uz via @politicususa According to the Brady Foundation, the gun manufacturing lobby has given Marco Rubio $3.3 million dollars during his tenure in the United States Senate.@RoyalAShepherd @uHThreaT @GregSylvander @RickyJMarc IMO, Celtics have the better roster.  But could have easily lost the series to Miami.  truth is, the 06' Pistons were better than the 06' Heat. 06' Heat have the trophy. Once we get to the final 4, all kinds of combinations can happen.

This sums up his on court value in a nutshell. @MiamiHEAT Pay him, don’t trade him https://t.co/gzHBFZGtkj@Wsutt @unclelukereal1 @MiamiHEAT As a heat fan we won’t but there is a slither of hope. Our team is so injured. If this was a regular game we would have 4-5 starters out plus our six man would have sat, but they feel forced to play through this. Ever since this photo jimmy has averaged 9 ppg too https://t.co/OE6bRJzzSXThis might be the toughest game to watch this season.

Nothing we haven’t been seeing for like 3-4 years now.

We’ll be doing the same with Mitchell too this offseason.

Miami does *not* have the (realistic) assets for either w/ out them demanding the 305.

We can’t keep doing this.

I wish more organizations would follow your lead

Also, thank you @MiamiHEAT for your stand on contacting Senators@Schandillia @ProsaicView Squid Game Miami Heat Season 2@MiamiHEAT excellent job on #commonsensegunlaws. @nba @Suns   #jointhefight@marcorubio @NBA @MiamiHEAT How about you deal with the children being murdered on our own soil.

Goosebumps from my childhood home team. Still my team❤️https://t.co/zmBfSG23y4Major upgrades looming this summer for the Heat. It’s the last ride for Pat Riley and his Immortals as he hunts for another new whale. Riley gonna set up the Heat in a big way one last time before he retires.

But boiii if I’m the @MiamiHEAT I’m not going for the way people acting like they loss the series. They gotta come to play in Boston. @Klow7 you better show up cause your legacy on the line. https://t.co/yN4LiRD7xC@RochieWBZ @warriors @celtics @MiamiHEAT @wbz @NBA It’s because the Warriors had a better record than the C’s and won the tie breaker against MIA (if they make it which I hope to Jah they don’t)PLEASE LOCK IN TOMMOROW 😭😭 @MiamiHEAT @HeatvsHaters https://t.co/lmQBKoW83T@HeatvsHaters @TheRealSeanMo96 @MiamiHEAT Better close your eyes then 🙈@MiamiHEAT Yes gun control because as we all know criminals follow the law....idiots stick to running back and forth on a court.Go check out their feed.  They've tweeted facts about gun violence.  Also, the @MiamiHEAT PA announcer told the fans at the game Wednesday night to call their Senators to pass gun control legislation. https://t.co/piPMOGo7dKWhiny diaper baby and bad tipper @marcorubio is mad that @MiamiHEAT took a stand against gun violence. Don't pretend to give a fuck about Muslims or voter suppression when you and your party push for xtian supremacy and voter suppression here.

Not saying that at all.@GoldinCo @KingJames @teamlebron @PaniniAmerica @Lakers @PSAcard @MiamiHEAT @cavs @NBA Manufactured in 2020So awesome what Miami Heat &amp; announcer did at their game telling everyone to call their legislators &amp; having a link on their website to register to vote. So great to hear all the fans cheering on that message.@AnnaForFlorida @RaysBaseball ohhhh THAT'S why they didn't go full Miami Heat and tell their fans to make it count at the ballot box.  @marcorubio got awfully butthurt about that 🎻@RochieWBZ @warriors @celtics @MiamiHEAT @wbz Whyyyyyyy does a lower seed get home court @nba this is some BSWell,the stage is half-set:  @warriors are #westernconferencechamps, having defeated @dallasmavs in 5 games.Just the beginning for @luka7doncic &amp; his team--they'll be back--
Friday already.@MiamiHEAT will face @celtics in Boston later tonight.Who will emerge victorious?TBD...It’s hard to overstate the symbolism here combined with the words from the @MiamiHEAT PA announcer regarding #UvaldeMassacre before the start of Game 5 against the @celtics last night- Both HUGE STATEMENTS by  @Yankees &amp; @RaysBaseball https://t.co/29m1VFJpOiLooks like everyone’s counting the miami heat out , @MiamiHEAT pls prove them wrong.@MiamiHEAT comeback!If you are in the US, check out my featured track:

I used to be Miami Heat.@_pbcdaniel @MiamiHEAT I’m going to watch tomorrows game with low expectations. If they win and force a game 7 I think they can pull it out.

It all starts June 2!@GilbertDurinho @MiamiHEAT Nah bro Celtics warriors cmon now@marcorubio @NBA @MiamiHEAT China is the magic pill for US politicians. All they do is say China, all the US domestic problems are deflected. Heard little Marco received $3M from NRA. Yes, China. US gun violence dead solved.@JimmysBurner5 @HeatvsHaters @MiamiHEAT Is it a fart?The blowouts by Boston in this series have not been a coincidence. The Miami Heat need more!

Maybe you should work on that before worrying about what other countries are doing.Miami heat forgive me but the golden state warriors are gonna be the champs this year unfortunatelyI’m sick that imma have to root for this version of the Celtics. Heat culture ain’t enough for Miami to win. Celtics match up better with the dubs. I don’t like Tatum or Jaylen brown but I love Marcus smart and al Horford deserves a ring. Anything but another warriors titleMiami Heat you up?…. Not even Celtics….

Let us not let go of our sadness and rage in a few days.@HeatvsHaters @MiamiHEAT We need to wear the Red Jerseys FridayI'm sure the warriors would rather play the heat but as a c's fan I don't see that happening. I think the c's-GSW is the better matchup, i think the GSW would beat miami in 5. Boston matches up well with the GSW; MS/DW on SC/JP, JB/DW on KT, JT on AW, AL on DG, RW on KL #DALvsGSWThe @MiamiHEAT and @warriors have dominated the finals since 2010-2011.

On the flip side, @celtics have dominated across the decades.

God bless!@thenwchica @marcorubio @RonDeSantisFL @MiamiHEAT FUCK YEAH@isolo3_ @DontGiveaSHIB @MiamiHEAT Y’all shot the ball 90 times and wanna be mad at us because we actually realize when we’re cold and attack the rim to draw fouls. Be mad at your players &amp; coaches that they don’t know how to adjust. 🤷🏾‍♂️🤣🤣 your backcourt is 1-28 in the last 2 games be mad at them 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣@MiamiHEAT @MickyArison Disgusting asking for political action!

Tell us why you want to change the subject.  You are up to your eyeballs in NRA blood money.@isolo3_ @DontGiveaSHIB @MiamiHEAT Like I said, that’s what happens when you take contested bad shots and don’t attack the paint. But y’all can’t, because you’re small like I said. I told you it’s gonna be an issue when our SF is taller than your center lol. Look at the FG numbers 🤣🤣@HeyShadowTV @DontGiveaSHIB @MiamiHEAT Imagine counting quarters 🤣🤣🤣 8v5 bro 8v5 https://t.co/udDXWvF5ytWish @MiamiHEAT could say the same. https://t.co/vllSi1DGiT@marcorubio @NBA @MiamiHEAT I didn’t realize The Heat was a Chinese team… We protest injustices in America because we are Americans.@isolo3_ @DontGiveaSHIB @MiamiHEAT And Na it definitely just applies for y’all lol. We’ve played 20 quarters so far over a 5 game span and y’all have won 5, we’ve won 15. We would be up 3-1 maybe even swept if we didn’t choke horribly in 1 quarter game 1 &amp; 3. Hard to win when you’re outscored by 20 ina quarter. 🤷🏾‍♂️At the Miami Heat game tonight the announcer asked people to vote for candidates in the mid-terms to push for sensible gun laws, yet no one could tell you what those laws would be.  In other words, just blindly vote for Democrats. Vote blindly, vote out of hate, vote out of fear.@MiamiHEAT @CoupNBA Time for V as in VINCENT and Victor.

Of course young guys will respect that structure. Wiggins’s unlocked. @NoDunksInc etc@MiamiHEAT @CoachSpo you better get all our guys ready for da game tomorrow, our 2nd  &amp; the rest of our bench. @JimmyButler   &amp; our starters we're getting da coach to hv ya'll some help.

Probably.@Kenny16Techs Agreed. This Celtics fan has been looking forward to the match against the Heat for weeks, but both teams are exhausted, injured and taking entire quarters off. I think Boston will outlast Miami and take Game 6, but will they have anything left in the tank for the finals?@MVPJaylenBrown @jaytatum0 @FCHWPO @Al_Horford @smart_MS3 @miamiheat play like you did on 6/7/12 👍I beg of you, @MiamiHEATI feel like @warriors should be call Golden 3s or golden Talent they are so good I enjoy watching them play. @MiamiHEAT should learn from this amazing team.Miami Heat LeBron was an actual cheat code https://t.co/f18UgKBT6U@MiamiHEAT pass along the word that @VicOladipo needs to start game 6@Zaknoble @MiamiHEAT @celtics We need @MiamiHEAT to get win tomorrow probably in a mental toughness blowout to give Game 7 in East a chance to be good. Tired of harping on fact that this round has sucked. At least leave me with a good taste in my mouth.@gregolear Miami/Dade had 249 murders in 2021. Did the Heat have a moment of silence for those people as well?Why is most every @nba playoff game not close. Some 60+ combined games for @warriors @dallasmavs @MiamiHEAT @Celtics and less than 10% were under 10pts w/ 3min left. So why are ratings higher? Poor officiating, excessive commercials, flopping &amp; traveling. 🤷🏼‍♂️ #unwatchable@marcorubio @NBA @MiamiHEAT Stop deflecting, you have blood on your little hands Marco. You days as a U.S. Senator representing Florida are numbered. #SenatorDemings@MiamiHEAT everyone saying the Celtics gonna win 👀 @JimmyButlerCome on @MiamiHEAT. Give me one Game 7. Maybe a Game 7 in CF will produce close game.We took the HEAT's playoffs success lightly.

As it nears an end, we can look back and really see that this Miami team was a shell of itself. Jimmy Butler's greatness really helped to shadow all of Miami's injuries and poor individual performances throughout this post season.Last nights game #miamiheat https://t.co/JXCAEsLhU4Hey @marcorubio this are your constituents.

#Uvalde #GunControlNow #GunReformNow  #MiamiHeat https://t.co/h1ft9yCiNT@marcorubio @NBA @MiamiHEAT Is the average American smart enough to grasp that Rubio's deflection is an admission? 

He knows his position on guns is wrong. He has no response other than to say "oh yeah, China."Plan “move @thejunipergoat to Miami” has begun! 

Let’s go Heat? https://t.co/vUDm9WG6pZ@filthEbacon999 @NBA @NBAOfficial @MiamiHEAT @dallasmavs @warriors @celtics I thought people in the #bayarea were supposed to be smart - why don't you take a look at the analytics #smartguy - touch fouls, 50/50 calls, missed calls per game, blocking calls above the 3 pt line, off the ball fouls.  Its so ridiculous, just get the best player frustratedDear god,

I read the following at the start of the Summit League baseball tournament. https://t.co/DENij2aj7T@kmmadms @Yankees Did you see where, after he tried to call out the Miami Heat for not wanting dead kids, it was revealed that  Rubio received a $3 Million donation from the NRA?Cc: @danbickley… the @Yankees and @RaysBaseball are leading here. So is the @nba with pregame moments of silence w/a CALL to ACTION at the @celtics v @MiamiHEAT and @dallasmavs v @warriors playoff games. 

Where are the @Dbacks ❓@MiamiHEAT I'm just saying think about it say you go out there ready to put up 200 points@marcorubio @NBA @MiamiHEAT And you are condemning a 3.2 million of American citizens who live in Puerto Rico to keep under the oldest colony of the world.

Boston has size. #MiamiHeatWhat are the chances of Jimmy Bulter or anyone on the Miami Heat having a LeBron James’s Game 6 vs the Celtics like he (LeBron) did back in the East Finals in 2012 when they were trailing 3-2 and LBJ went for 45? #LeBron James #BostonCeltics #MiamiHeat #NBAPlayoffs2022 #Perkins@marcorubio @NBA Our schools, places of worship, grocery stores, other public spaces are under attack. Our leaders are not responding, keeping us safe. @MiamiHEAT response = plea for help from you and your colleagues and public outrage against inability to end this plague of #GunViolence@EricButler85233 They have had it. We all have. I fully expect DeSantis to tell @miamiheat they can’t speak about the situation again because we don’t want a “woke” @NBA lecturing us.GSN-Victor Oladipo and the Miami Heat faced a tough challenge entering Game 5 of Wednesday’s Eastern Conference Finals at the Boston Celtics’ TD Garden.
