I will not sit here and give him flowers for putting up basic numbers when that’s expected, sorryTimeout Mavs with 9:32 in the fourth, Nets trail 88-85.

Brooklyn comes out of the stoppage guns a-blazing. Patty Mills and KD just hit their first triples of the game.

After a 1-for-8 third, Kevin Durant scored five points in Brooklyn’s 10-2 run, cutting the deficit to only three points. 

Plenty of time left on the clock — 9:32.How good is 🇦🇺 Patty Mills going in the @NBA Dropping three pointers for fun @BrooklynNets@BrooklynNets let’s goRare (This Season) 2-minute spurt where the Brooklyn Nets go nuclear.

🚨Like I've been seeing and saying so far this season. The @BrooklynNets aren't doing ANYTHING this year. This team is in shambles. Harden looks washed, Nash is not a good coach, Kryie sabotaged the team. AND THEY HAVE NO HEART! 💯 #FACTS@BrooklynNets Some defense would be niceAGAINST BROOOOOOKLYNNNNN!!!!

The Nets outscored them 25-24 in the third, the first quarter Brooklyn has won.@michhy011 @BJGaming1 @BrooklynNets Why did Nash bench him with under a 2 min in the 3rd and after he hit a 3. Nash makes no sense sometimes@NyyFanSince97 @BrooklynNets @Pacers @dallasmavs Porzingis has so much less value than Mavs fans think he does 😂😂😂There’s no urgency. I can’t even make out what plays were running. It’s so much 2 man. Hardens so painfully inconsistent. Summin is up with KD. Our key player is sat at home having a wank. There’s no spacing. There are so many issues with this team right now. #Nets #BrooklynNets@BJGaming1 @BrooklynNets He’s 5/8 with 17 and like 9 assists. Been one of the only bright spots  , are you even watching the game ?They forgot to say both coached the @BrooklynNets 🤣@BrooklynNets Steve Nash has to discipline these players. They are horrible on the defensive end of the floor 🤬🤬🤬🤬This is what happens @BrooklynNets when you play hard for a half and the other team plays hard for the entire game. https://t.co/L5c3t5XMDpDORIAN ESFRIANDO O NETS

1- Fire Steve Nash.
2- Trade Harden and get Myles turner and LeVert.
3- Let Kyrie retire.
4- Rebuild around KD.I have no idea what game Steve Nash was watching because Brooklyn looked completely lethargic.

Only player to do that, I miss Houston Harden.@BrooklynNets Bro harden is so trash OMG. Foo, got no off ball movement and wants the ball in his hands 80 percent of the time. Only time he releases the ball is either he is passing for a shot late in the shot clock or shooting wtf.@BrooklynNets can we make our 3s?@melissAr2288 @BrooklynNets I had hope in them but that’s down the drain.@BrooklynNets damm I didn't realize how bad this team fucking blows 😂I’m reading my first Net Galley and I love it. When I worked in New York publishing, all the cool kids read paper bound galleys on the F train to Brooklyn. I read catalog copy on the Express bus to the Bronx. But my time has come. Congrats @B_Yee09 !! #goldmountain #NetGalley https://t.co/SZuxLGRSzM@BrooklynNets Fire Nash@BrooklynNets Still losing by a lot@BrooklynNets This team so garbage without KD@mosballin @BrooklynNets And take Turner also. I will drive Irving I my own car to Indian.@BrooklynNets Ya’ll letting Porzingis off easily@ItzFidoking @RatiodByJynx @BrooklynNets Lmao you must think bron the goatWith 8:36 to play in the first half, Mavs lead the Nets 36-26. 

Harden tried to draw a foul and got swatted by Porzingis. Led to a fast break dunk for Hardaway Jr. A non-aggressive game from Harden is the last thing they need right now. Brooklyn 1-9 on 3Ps not helping either.@samtibolt @BrooklynNets There so bad losing me money everyday@w3rd3r11 @BrooklynNets I mean only -1.5 spread obviously they loseALERT: New high roller bet posted!

I m going to support a real team like the Bucks. I m tired of this bsHarden is just playing like a fucking idiot at this point..why you scared to shoot? And then you go and take an even uglier shot and get your shit swatted..cant even defend this stupidity man.. #BrooklynNets@BrooklynNets Play Durant 48 min@BrooklynNets Rebuild, this team is not winning shit@TheSmallHumph My Brooklyn Nets have 0 spacing without Ritz man Joe Harris I’m gonna kill myself@BrooklynNets Harden dribbling and foul baiting wayy too much 😭@w3rd3r11 @BrooklynNets They already lost unfortunately@BrooklynNets Stop tweeting you getting cookedDallas Mavericks - Brooklyn Nets

It almost didn’t matter which guys were missing last season the Nets still generated quality looks.

Their #7 defense has masked this issue to an extent but definitely something this group needs to fix.Dallas Mavericks - Brooklyn Nets

Bet slip link: https://t.co/4GdKPzCwMh https://t.co/vbRNVBDWyMI'm an analytics guy so I don't like the mid-range jumper.
I'm a @BrooklynNets fan, and our two most consistent scorers are @KDTrey5 and @aldridge_12, two of the very best mid-range shooters.
Therefore...
I love the mid-range jumper.
