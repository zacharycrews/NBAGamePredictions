▪ 10.0 RPG

Philly acknowledged that by trading him before his rookie contract was up. You think Oden was a bust bc lack of talent??In Game 3, of the 2021-2022 #NewYork #Knicks #NationalBasketballAssociation Season, played on #October 24, 2021, The New York Knicks lost to The #Orlando #Magic; The New York Knicks record is now 2-1 https://t.co/H3CgpdcvD2@factsonfactspod @statmuse @OrlandoMagic @Magic_PR He wasn't on the court initially because of a shoulder injury he could not control and he completely had to change his entire game and relearn how to shoot. Why are u counting that as an injury?In Game 2, of the 2021-2022 #NewYork #Knicks #NationalBasketballAssociation Season, played on #October 22, 2021, The New York Knicks defeated The #Orlando #Magic; The New York Knicks record is now 2-0 https://t.co/URKg9QvslM@1stToTheParty @OrlandoMagic @DetroitPistons @BallySportsFL @969thegame @jalensuggs Good luck@OTownNBA @statmuse @OrlandoMagic @Magic_PR But he’s unreliable, regardless of why he’s out and missing time.. he’s never on the court, and when on the court not giving enough production to make me think he’ll ever live up to being the 1st pick in a NBA draft.@factsonfactspod @statmuse @OrlandoMagic @Magic_PR "im not saying he can't turn it around" is all u need to say, he's 23. He has so much time to improve and he's in a situation to succeed, the bust label should only be placed upon after they are 26 or older@Dan_Savage @OrlandoMagic @DetroitPistons @The_ColeAnthony @jalensuggs @franzboogie @chuma_okeke @freep Thanks for having me!@OTownNBA @statmuse @OrlandoMagic @Magic_PR By 1st pick in the draft standards he absolutely is a bust, he’s 4 yrs into his career and played more than 20 games 1 time &amp; avg 11 pts, 5 ast and 3 reb on 45% from the field and 27% from 3.. in not saying he can’t turn it around, but by 1st pick in the draft standards yes bust.@statmuse @OrlandoMagic @Magic_PR Very happy for him@OrlandoMagic @DetroitPistons @BallySportsFL @969thegame @jalensuggs Detroit is favored by 6😂😂😂 if you want some free money put it in Orlando tonight@OrlandoMagic @DetroitPistons @BallySportsFL @969thegame @jalensuggs Suggs is so fine.😍@ORL_EGW @OTownNBA @statmuse @OrlandoMagic @Magic_PR Yes I’d want to see growth in a 25-30 win season.. then try for the play-in next season, I just think the East is too stacked for the Magic to get in at this point.@factsonfactspod @statmuse @OrlandoMagic @Magic_PR MCW isn't a key player, he's just a guy that'd help our depth. Fultz is not a bust and is clearly our best playmaker and ball handler, and would help our perimeter defense a good bit. He, Isaac and Okeke are our three best players arguably and all 3 of them are yet to play@Dan_Savage @chuma_okeke @OrlandoMagic @DetroitPistons Best news i heard in a while.@OTownNBA @statmuse @OrlandoMagic @Magic_PR Lol bro fans of every team overrate their favorite teams players, no fan of another team would view MCW as a key player (or Fultz who’s widely viewed as a bust).. Terry Rozier and PJ Washington for Hornets didn’t play against the Magic.. it all balances out@factsonfactspod @OTownNBA @statmuse @OrlandoMagic @Magic_PR Agreed. I’m just saying with a healthy roster this team has a ceiling of winning enough games to reach the play in. I doubt that will happen, but it’s a possibility. All fans want to see is growth this year and I agree we can see that even if we are a 25-30 win team.The season premiere of "Inside the @OrlandoMagic" debuts TONIGHT postgame on @BallySportsFL! Get to know new #MagicTogether Head Coach Jamahl Mosley this evening on a very special episode. https://t.co/379KOHEHjt@factsonfactspod @statmuse @OrlandoMagic @Magic_PR Fultz has had two injuries that are completely unrelated, one was a shoulder syndrome, the other an ACL tear. Way too early to label him injury prone. The opponents have missed key players but not as much as we have. Isaac and MCW are, but Isaac is still young af@OTownNBA @statmuse @OrlandoMagic @Magic_PR Probably so, but those have been injury prone players throughout their careers Isaac, Fultz &amp; MCW. You’re also ignoring the opponents you’ve faced that have missed key players.. it balances out ultimately, I think Magic should stick to their rebuild &amp; focus on player development.@fissum @jga41agher Always have this discussion every year, you need atleast 115 to win a game today, if one man wanna get it so be it. This what Atlanta did to the Orlando magic when we had dwight. Dwight was getting between 30-40 a game, they just stay home on the shooters and won the series.I tried learning Greek 🇬🇷 today! Let’s hope one day a Greek player plays for the @OrlandoMagic #MagicTogether https://t.co/Yvxl1kFZAs@factsonfactspod @statmuse @OrlandoMagic @Magic_PR Maybe the record would not change much but we'd clearly be a much better team. Our creation is lacking, Markelle Fultz is amazing at that. Our rebounding and interior defense has been good but Isaac would make it great. Our depth isn't good, add those two, Okeke, MCW and Moore in🏀 @OrlandoMagic at @DetroitPistons Preview 🏀

https://t.co/l80KiLo6Jo@ORL_EGW @OTownNBA @statmuse @OrlandoMagic @Magic_PR That’s true about the lottery being a crap shoot, but I can assure you the Magic management are expecting a high pick after this season and not a team that’ll compete down the line.. they just tore it down at the trade deadline last season, this is the beginning of a rebuild.@OTownNBA @statmuse @OrlandoMagic @Magic_PR I’m saying I don’t think much different bc the reality is no matter how talented, young players don’t know how to win in the nba.. it takes time, maybe more competitive, but I don’t think the record would be much different.@factsonfactspod @OTownNBA @statmuse @OrlandoMagic @Magic_PR No faith in the lottery.

Im used to the old culture of “I think I did ok, obviously there’s room for improvement” &amp; “we need to be better. Other guys…” type of narrative. Not putting anyone on blast but there’s still interviews on YouTube.Putting in some good work @OrlandoMagic ! The wins will come along!

Enjoy your night.@Stout20Stout @toughcoverpod Orlando Magic overs may be something to monitor going forward! 5-1 so far on the over and Vegas still views them as a low 200’s team.@antmann77 @OrlandoMagic No hard feelings it’s actually nice, I won’t shy away from my comment . One draft pick agree . 42 years old and would love to see this organization allow these players to develop  . Hoping for great things for keke as well . Cut the 17 turnovers and they winYou gotta love @The_ColeAnthony !! Class act giving a tip of the hat to Trent for making a good defensive play on the final poss. @OrlandoMagic got a real one w/ Cole! You can tell he’s going to be a leader on this team. Haven’t been this excited ina long time for #MagicTogether https://t.co/UZN6OhLvvm@OrlandoMagic @jalensuggs @SASsoftware Niceeee@NickPedone12 Right now I’d compare him to Nick Anderson an Orlando Magic star but not really an NBA star that helped lead the Magic to the playoffs in the mid 90s. I’d say his ceiling is Manu Ginóbili who was a great player but was always overshadowed by the great players around him.Hey @OrlandoMagic Bing Bong lmao@httrhao When I first moved to Florida I went to an Orlando Magic playoff game by myself!

https://t.co/9TzWDPVeiz@leafyseven @tljvisuals @OrlandoMagic ? This got nothing to do with Barnes lol but@TylerHon14 @OrlandoMagic I’m with ya 100%@HeartHustleORL @OrlandoMagic Right that's where it absolutely makes zero sense. If he wanted to do a timeout call it on the rebound. 
Plus, Toronto is a good defense no arguments. I want the game winner on a scrambled defense than set defense any day. Just makes zero sense man. Wanted this win bad.@TylerHon14 @OrlandoMagic With that being said , Mosley is a rookie too. I have no doubt he will get better in these situations &amp; get better overall as the year goes on@wander_szn @tljvisuals @OrlandoMagic Barnes had 21 as well sooo.Toronto Raptors edge Orlando Magic 110-109
https://t.co/CXzHgOIgEv https://t.co/SKz905PDHx@TylerHon14 @OrlandoMagic Agree, bad timeout. If you take it after you get the defensive rebound , I can understand it a bit more, but calling it after Suggs comes past half court &amp; allowing Tor to set up there defense was a mistake imo.The Toronto Raptors defeat the Orlando Magic 110-109.

#MagicTogether@OrlandoMagic Heartbreaking Nice effort tho@magic78723728 @OrlandoMagic Gg. Anthony is so good@ZackOnLife @OrlandoMagic I couldn’t agree more! Very encouraging to see how this team has played so far. Take away that one blowout against the Knicks &amp; we’ve been in every game@OrlandoMagic All trolling aside, GG’s Magic fans yall played ur hearts out. Future looking bright with both Suggs and Scottie in the league 🤝‼️Sweep of losses in Raps game remind me why I stick to CBB.

The process looked right. Magic turn it over 17 times (to Raps’ 7), leading to 11 Raps steals. OG gets 0 of those. Orlando only gets 34 threes off (below their average).

However, Magic equalize w/ 47% 3 point shooting. https://t.co/5tdBCO059A@OrlandoMagic No cole anthony clutch today 😔@OrlandoMagic Good game, good effort overall. Sad that we can't take that W, Let's Go for another hustle on the next game!. Good game raptors 💫💙 #magictogether@magic78723728 @OrlandoMagic Fellow panthers fan?@OrlandoMagic BING BONG 🤫🤭 https://t.co/dirKflLG5s@Sportsguy10111 @OrlandoMagic i was yelling timeout but sure let’s just throw up a contested half court shotHow the fuck do the magic come back and get the ball with 5 seconds left and Cole Anthony just dribbles it off his leg. Like WHAT THE FUCK IS THAT SHIT. JESUS CHRIST FUCK YOU @OrlandoMagic  THAT WAS YOUR COMEBACK OF THE YEAR AND YOU FUCKING DRIBBLE IT OFF YOUR FOOTHow did the crew miss this huge block by Suggs with the score at 106-110 before the Wagner 3!? @OrlandoMagic @jalensuggs https://t.co/ToZY3eTsah@OrlandoMagic Why did coach call a time out? You give a chance to let the defense set-up!
Mo would have drained that 3 from top of the keyRaptors beat the Magic. Just. Nearly threw away this game giving up a last minute 8-0 run but defense digs in, esp Gary Trent jr. FVV's shooting heats up in the 2nd half. Alot of trouble with Orlando's length. OG/FVV @ 40/39 min on the night before a B2B #rtz #wethenorth@OrlandoMagic Good fight tonight boys@OrlandoMagic Poverty franchise cant even get someone who can dribble a ball lmfaooo@OrlandoMagic GG!! Sorry about the petty Raptors fans, Suggs is GREAT! Almost gave me a heart attack gg!@tljvisuals @OrlandoMagic 23 points clutch block and a clutch 4 point play@OrlandoMagic Great game Magic fans, your team looks great, that was a close game.

Scottie Barnes terrorized the Magic until his eye injury. Jalen Suggs was also great.

Two awesome rookies. Bright futures. Ditto Dalano Banton.

Regardless, I’m still glad we can beat Orlando…that’s that matters. Had me a little worried thereDisappointing last possession there but what a game! This team didn’t quit &amp; keeps showing fight!

#MagicTogetherWow how to stop a youngster... Magic: Poke him in the eyes. Now Orlando has to forfeitDid teams like @OrlandoMagic and @cavs correctly predict how the rule changes would dictate the way the game was played? Beautiful to see all this diversity in lineups and play styles early on.

#NBA75 #NBAIf the Orlando Magic injured Scottie Barnes that’s just one more reason to hate Florida (yes, I’m looking at you Tampa 👀)also: all four Magic reserves, plus FWagner, have a negative plus-minus. Orlando continues to struggle when it breaks its starting group.Orlando Magic highlights tras 2 cuartos vs Raptors:

Raptors 54
#Magic 51

Wendell Carter Jr. 13 pts. 
Mo Bamba 12 pts., 10 rebs. 

Orlando has turned the ball over 10 times in the 1st half and the Raptors have 14 2nd-chance points.#Magic trail the #Raptors 54-51 at the half. A lot of really good moments. Toronto hitting some mid-range jumpers. Too many turnovers the big factor. Orlando has to straighten out their point guard rotation better.Barnes is having a good game. Happy for him.
