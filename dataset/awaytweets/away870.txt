Nets-Knicks tip shortly. Can Brooklyn make it two in a row? Knicks are w/out RJ Barrett &amp; Derek Rose. If you haven't heard, Kyrie Irving is ineligible tonight.@BrooklynNets @newyorklottery 2nd winThe @espn game between the @nyknicks and @BrooklynNets is not televised in the Philippines.@BrooklynNets @newyorklottery Shoots 😩🥴 https://t.co/DAMebu9DJ1@BrooklynNets @KDTrey5 @BenSimmons25 @24_camthomas @BruceBrown11 KD looks thrilled.The #Nets skip town for the #BattleoftheBoroughs against the #Knicks at #MadisonSquareGarden. #Brooklyn has claimed the past four such meetings, each by no more than seven points.

At least his slow half-court style and passing will suit Embiid better than Simmons.

We ain’t want Simmons is a better fit for Brooklyn anyways.  And we got Drummond and Seth curry out of the deal.

This is totally nonsensical. https://t.co/riG9YMe1xq@ellistheenby @pklep2mk @BrooklynNets @ZRuiz316 @BenSimmons25 He can’t get to the rim in the playoffs and the D will sag off of him. KD or KI will be doubled on the catch thus limiting them. Simmons is only dynamic in transition. Playoffs are a half court game. You’ll see.."..it just doesn’t quite make sense to me that an away player who is unvaccinated can play in Barclays but the home player can’t. To me, that’s a reason they should take a look at that ordinance."#AdamSilver

Lol bruh this is a ridiculous reachMENTALLY READY

Ben Simmons said he is mentally ready to return to basketball following his trade to the Brooklyn Nets after a turbulent end to his Philadelphia 76ers career.

Simmons has not played at all this season after requesting a trade from the Sixers in August.

It would take a all World Series from him and embiid to beat Brooklyn and at this stage idk if harden has that. Just dumb decisionAnd they say @sixers won the trade against our @BrooklynNets? 😏 https://t.co/zS3zGZrmQ6brooklyn nets have defense now https://t.co/s37ReoLrMg@mcgripp16 @BrooklynNets @AndreDrummond Lol yall dont got real retired numbers, your the nets 😂@BrooklynNets @BenSimmons25 He fen be pressure@HoopsxTroll @KaisVaccine @BrooklynNets @AndreDrummond My arm says both I believe https://t.co/TYUAxOPND3@Pr0d_Dr0gan @Foster8895 @SportsCenter @BrooklynNets Created by salty Donovan fans@macexmets @KaisVaccine @BrooklynNets @AndreDrummond Imagine they lose 11 in a row@mcgripp16 @BrooklynNets @AndreDrummond Thts what I thoughtI'm referring to Ben Simmons, of the Brooklyn Nets@macexmets @KaisVaccine @BrooklynNets @AndreDrummond You’re a Knicks fan@macexmets @KaisVaccine @BrooklynNets @AndreDrummond Look at his face he already fed up@DrGuru_ If you had a memory longer than 2 days harden wanted to go to Philly as well as the nets, he not being fake Brooklyn just offered better, I hate harden a lot but this is a bad take@BrooklynNets @AndreDrummond Looked like Bembry in the first pic for a sec...@KaisVaccine @BrooklynNets @AndreDrummond Nope Harden is on the bench watching his team right now🔥 https://t.co/q8UIEJmfPC@BrooklynNets @AndreDrummond My Center 💯🔥@BrooklynNets @AndreDrummond He does, but question; I thought #4 was retired for Wendell Ladner?Ben Simmons thinks the Brooklyn #nets are going to be the team to beat in the East... Do you agree with him? #NBA https://t.co/hxRiaNiPYU@BrooklynNets @AndreDrummond I’m crying😂😂😂 Get used to this Harden🔥🔥🔥🔥 https://t.co/6gcIJIbGhp@BrooklynNets @AndreDrummond BEAST@peanutsdad2012 @BleacherReport @BrooklynNets Lean muscle and well put together too!! He has ZERO jumpshot but he can slash and drive with the best of them. He's also an A1 defender and Assist guy... I think this trade works in the Nets favor. They are better off today...@BrooklynNets @AndreDrummond Slimmer than Harden@BrooklynNets @AndreDrummond Thought this was harden for a sec lol@TheHoopCentral @BrooklynNets Make sure you thank Harden 😊 he was the only one who could get you back on the court 🤔😂@BrooklynNets @AndreDrummond Him and Simmons will feast together😤@BrooklynNets @AndreDrummond We fleeced 76ersBig fella looks good in black &amp; white https://t.co/PIEk3xIPoH@Joeldaman_ @BrooklynNets @BenSimmons25 😂😂 my bad.Harden left Brooklyn for this lmaooo, He watched the Celtics blow out the Nets by 30 last week and now he’s watching his new team get blown out by them, difference is his new team has its best player playing. 😭@SportsCenter @BrooklynNets WHAT JOURNEY????🤣🤣🤣🤣Bought it from the @BrooklynNets Store they mine as well lemme just pick that jawn up I'm the next state over@BrooklynNets @BenSimmons25 Mad everyone has missed the opportunity to call him Benny BrooklynBeen a while and since its been a while, I had to drop this one the biggest trade made earlier this month.  @KojoNketsia @BrooklynNets @sixers 

https://t.co/3kQd36fvV5@JoshEberley Brooklyn Nets fans: I wonder if you’ll be as patient as Sixers fans.
If KD hits 40pts, Kyrie hits 35pts and Ben costs the game on missed FTs, tell me KD and the fans will be fine with that.@BrooklynNets @BenSimmons25 This the start of a new NBA villain@ovopapi__ @lebronluvschina @ChrisPrattc581 @SportsCenter @BrooklynNets They're absolutely not better. Their best player is awesome but has been injured so much lately, and besides that they have Kyrie who can only play 1/2 their games and Ben who struggles a ton in the playoffs and has to be benched. Embiid hasn't had a real chance except for 2019@BrooklynNets @BenSimmons25 He on the nets know oh shit@QueenPooka2u @NetsDaily I'm not sure where you're going with this. but, my point is, he did not take down any players or coaches[mature]. Again, he's in Philly! I cheer for The Nets, the Harden book is close for me. Let's go, Brooklyn!!!@BrooklynNets @KDTrey5 Recovering soon KD!#embracethelight Happy Valentines Day! Brooklyn Nets https://t.co/X0ysPwuuOwThe @BrooklynNets losing streak is over, and guess who led the way?!
SETH Curry.  The newly acquired #shooting #guard put up 23 points on 56% shooting, while grabbing 7 rebounds and dishing out 5 assists.

Then it’ll be the Nets fault, or Brooklyn’s fault, or KD’s fault. Or he’ll have a “mental health” relapse.

Look at the mess with Brooklyn Net Kyrie Irving.@SportsProphet1 @sixers @BrooklynNets Well, Curry is a big addition for the Nets too. In fact, huge. The biggest factors here are part time Kyrie and how long it takes for KD to be back and running.Sixers look weak without Ben #Sixers #Nets #Brooklyn #BenSimmons@zawday @BleacherReport You want to stan for Harden? Roll with the Sixers. We support Kyrie,he chose Brooklyn Nets over Knicks that in itself to love the man@BrooklynNets @dbearak @sdotcurry Curry spice@PosterizaSean @pklep2mk @ellistheenby @BrooklynNets @ZRuiz316 @BenSimmons25 And he on the all defensive team 😂 philly fans hate the truth@ellistheenby @BrooklynNets @ZRuiz316 @BenSimmons25 4 on 5 offense is great especially in the playoffs that's going to be hilarious@pklep2mk @ellistheenby @BrooklynNets @ZRuiz316 @BenSimmons25 How is it a four on five offense when Ben can fully control the paint because he got shooters everywhere? Lmfao your logic is ass 😭@BrooklynNets @BenSimmons25 LmaoCan we just admit that @JHarden13 isn't going to do well with the @sixers. He gave up on the @HoustonRockets and forced himself over to the @BrooklynNets. Now he forced his way to Philly. 

Hey James, your suit is playing defense against you.

I don't trust Harden come playoffs and KD, Kyrie and Simmons it's a matter of time before one of them can't get out of his own way to sabotage the other two.@IslandDiggs @SportsCenter @BrooklynNets He had the best 3pt shooter by avg of all time, best corner 3 shooter of last decade and a top 3 3ball shooting center. The narrative the team wasn’t built for him is really dumb.@NickFriedell Why it looks like he just got a haircut. Smh @BrooklynNets do better on that floor. Looking like a trap houseHot take, by 2028, Ben Simmons and Kyrie will be the duo leading brooklyn and dominating, ben simmons will have a jason kidd type jumpshot development and the nets will have won 2 chips by then #NetsWorldBeen watching film on Ben Simmons. A lot of film from the 2018-19 season - a season he noted in his press conference earlier today where he sees himself in a similar role with Brooklyn.

If the Nets can stay healthy, I can easily see Simmons have the best play of his career.@BrooklynNets @BenSimmons25 Hey if things don’t work out in the NBA you can play in the Australian league…if your mentally ready.@SportsCenter @BrooklynNets Good luck with a guy who will sit the last 8 mins of games to avoid intentional fouls.@BrooklynNets @BenSimmons25 The start of 4 on 5 on offense
