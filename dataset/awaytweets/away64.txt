I actually think that Trae Young is better than what Derrick Rose was in his early 20s, but he is just a different type of point guard. I just don’t know if it’s humanly possible for a 6‘3 point guard to be is as athletic as Derrick Rose was.Throwing this out there… the Leafs haven’t exactly inspired confidence this year but down 2-0 after one against Chicago seems like an ideal time to live bet them to win.
