  #betting #Basketball #Minnesota #Timberwolves #New #Orleans #Pelicans'Pelicans' AD' was so tough when he was playing for New Orleans. Where is that AD? We need that AD so bad. If he plays that way IT WILL BE OVER for any team. I swear.Devonte‚Äô likely won‚Äôt be an All-Star caliber player‚Ä¶ but he has the desired skillset to make a significant impact on the ceiling of this team if he keeps it up. 

Devonte‚Äô is a different type of player. One that we haven‚Äôt seen in a New Orleans before.

#Pelicansyeah the new orleans pelicans can go to hell https://t.co/2Vgq5H78CpSmall Sample Size‚Ä¶ BUT! Devonte‚Äô Graham‚Äôs shooting has been a revelation in New Orleans through 2 games and has a REAL shot to be the player Shamit was talking about here.

Graham is currently leading the league in Pull-Up 3s made w/ 7. He‚Äôs hitting 70% thru 2gms.
