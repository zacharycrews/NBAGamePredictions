Mavs @ Nuggets
- Denver Nuggets -3.5 @ $1.92 (-108) 

Jokic active, I make this between -5.5/6.0 for Denver. Tough spot for DAL who got 30+ mins from five guys last night against SAS. https://t.co/GTN3TpCbJRI finally get to watch a @nuggets game on @espn it's usually on @AltitudeTV which @Xfinity doesn't have.
