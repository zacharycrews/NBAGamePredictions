No rebuild when Dirk retired. They went and got Luka. Luka destroys the Grizz.  No answer for that dude.@The_DocHolliday @THEStephenSR @memgrizz @warriors They're just sticking to the script man. Last established super star in Steph so they have to protect their "product". Keep the bigger market in the playoffs. They're fixing to get away with every travel foul everything to keep it out of Memphis  for game 7.I’m either about to watch the best game 6 of my life or watch our last game of the season.  Either way the @memgrizz have given me so much joy this year and this team is so damn fun to cheer for #WeDeep@CitizensTn @StephenCurry30 @Money23Green @memgrizz @SpacesGrizzlies @dubnationinside No argument here.

Ja Morant - Jackson Jr. - Bane - Brooks - Jones - Adams https://t.co/bO98waUdUx@Extended_Kalman @memgrizz If anything it's gonna be scary for the Warriors 😈😈😈The Memphis grizzlies really fell right into the trap of a game 6 klay 🤦‍♀️My eyes are on the @memgrizz vs @warriors today.

My pick is MEM, even tho they're visiting. Morant set a good course offensively, but with him out &amp; Adams in GSW is playing a new team.

No way they'll learn the difference in the span of a game.

Go Griz!🐻

He’s the best shooter of all time,  but if he loses this series after up 3-1 he should not be talked about as one of the “greatest players ever”.I said it before &amp;  Ill say it again before the outcome of each game tonight but proud of the boys for an amazing season &amp; no matter the outcome of tonight proud of the way they were in the playoffs too! Good luck tonight @NYRangers @celtics &amp; @memgrizz! Win or go home situation!'We may be down, but we're not out.'

How Taylor Jenkins and @memgrizz aim to steal Game 6 tonight at Golden State and force a 7th and decisive game @FedExForum in Memphis.

Games 5, 6, and 7 were eventually recognized as the beginning of a dynastic decade for the Memphis Grizzlies. https://t.co/tLiFV4yA4mMEMPHIS IN 7 @memgrizz@Sportswizard8 @NBA @celtics @Bucks @memgrizz @warriors Stephs legacy wouldnt be tarnished if he shot 0/20, they lose series and never plays again.. The man is a 3x champion and only player to have back to back and unanimous MVPs with 1 team.. and the best shooter in the history of the entire game… I THINK his legacy is cemented…Trae Young- changed the entire Atlanta Hawks organization 

Ja Morant- changed the entire Memphis Grizzlies organization 

LaMelo Ball- changed the entire Charlotte Hornets organization 

D’Angelo Russell- brought two franchises back to the playoffs
