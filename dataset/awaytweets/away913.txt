Away at Lakers tonight. Lakers are horrid. Pelicans have been a different team after acquiring CJ McCollum. They just dropped off the Suns 2 nights ago. Lakers also on the back end of a back to back.

Like if you are following 👍🏼 https://t.co/1QfVn2rl1EThe Lakers are hobbled and will either be without LeBron or will see him play at less than 100%. The New Orleans Pelicans have been better against the spread away from home of late, and we like their chances tonight behind CJ McCollum. 
https://t.co/HbZI5g2bXAThread (6/7)
Lakers, 18-14 at home, are coming off a loss to a depleted Clippers team. As New Orleans, 11-19 on the road, await the return of Zion Williamson as newly acquired CJ McCollum has provided a new scoring spark for the Pelicans. #LakeShow  #WBD  #NBA75  #LOTDLS https://t.co/oLuT15CfcyCharlotte Hornets - Detroit Pistons
