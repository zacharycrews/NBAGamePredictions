https://t.co/n4aWG2Shy7@StevieCozens @AnferneeSimons @ripcityproject @trailblazers Stevie, do you think his play makes the Blazers more open to change their stance on moving Dame?@blazersfaithful @fischerscast @trailblazers @NBA @NBATA And here is my final trade of the season https://t.co/vJIgtYkt3S@ElleRC84 @OregonGovBrown @trailblazers @OregonState She will back down when we quit complying.
#MasksOff@blazersfaithful @fischerscast @trailblazers @NBA @NBATA Agreed. Capitalize on him playing well. He‚Äôs gonna get paid in Charlotte too. 

Here is my second trade https://t.co/dVUZDXkbSq@Coach_nick89 @blazersfaithful @trailblazers @NBA @NBATA Knick the only team to make julius something he not and last year worked really good with the ball in hands, julius is a dominant camp the post and thrive player - julius is being forced into playing a different role with the knicks@Coach_nick89 @fischerscast @trailblazers @NBA @NBATA this is great since nurk is a free agent this off season, although he has been playing insane recently i think we have to trade him at the deadline@fischerscast @blazersfaithful @trailblazers @NBA @NBATA Here‚Äôs a trade I‚Äôd do. https://t.co/WoTPadzZ8C@fischerscast @blazersfaithful @trailblazers @NBA @NBATA Randle isn‚Äôt a good defender either and is best suited as a small ball 5 so he can use his athleticism against other slower bigger players. I want an athletic center who can shoot and protect the rimTrail Blazers Game Notes: Portland Trail Blazers (19-26) vs. Toronto Raptors (22-21): PORTLAND TRAIL BLAZERS (19-26) AT TORONTO RAPTORS (22-21) https://t.co/Wx4yLfZrqS #RipCity https://t.co/mpmIIEQVfH@fischerscast @blazersfaithful @trailblazers @NBA @NBATA Julius is only effective in high usage situations with the ball in his hand. He‚Äôs an inconsistent shooter who forces long contested 2s. He‚Äôs a good ball player. Not a good fit in PDX. CJ limits ants ceiling. Hence him being dealt. Ant is a 40+ percent catch and shoot player@Coach_nick89 @blazersfaithful @trailblazers @NBA @NBATA Lillard takes away from Simons ceiling - Damian and Julius will ball out - Julius will play natural position, julius not taking the ball up in the half court with lillard on the team, Julius will play the no 3 option and thrive in Portland@bln231 @trailblazers @NBA @NBATA I have 4 sisters and a wonderful mother.  I have a little girl and a beautiful wife of 15 years.  I promise I have no issue with that.  I have no issue with women.  I would have issue if a company or organization would take advantage of them.@fischerscast @blazersfaithful @trailblazers @NBA @NBATA Hard pass 
Trade Nurk 
Trade Roco 
Trade CJ
Trade Norm

A Holliday@Coach_nick89 @fischerscast @trailblazers @NBA @NBATA he is a good player but not for the blazers he is very very inconsistent shooting the ball he turns the ball over way to much and he isn‚Äôt a good defender but yes i went a bit far saying that@blazersfaithful @fischerscast @trailblazers @NBA @NBATA Meh I wouldn‚Äôt go that far. I wouldn‚Äôt mind him if it were for say Nance and RoCo. But I‚Äôm not giving anything of value for him currently on the roster.@Coach_nick89 @fischerscast @trailblazers @NBA @NBATA yeah i know i‚Äôm saying i wouldn‚Äôt want him if we could have him for free@ElleRC84 @OregonGovBrown @trailblazers @OregonState It is the professors.  They are the ones causing remote school.@blazersfaithful @fischerscast @trailblazers @NBA @NBATA Not a chance.

I kept @YouTubeTV (it‚Äôs the best) and if you‚Äôre ever back on a channel they carry, I‚Äôll gladly watch every single game (like in seasons past). #RipCity forever. https://t.co/jobbzstzgH@fischerscast @trailblazers @NBA @NBATA Lol he said Ant for Randle@chrlywd1 @hoopsjock @trailblazers @NBA @NBATA Why are you assuming she isn‚Äôt the best candidate at her position?

Maybe if you had some critical thinking skills, this wouldn‚Äôt be hard for you. Instead your trying to rationalize why a woman got hired it must be politics.@trailblazers @ROOTSPORTS_NW @NBA @NBATA Congratulations Jessica üñ§‚ô•Ô∏è@mjv0217 @trailblazers Yes! I saw that game too! There was something Norm said recently after the "drama" surrounding Blazers, something like norm said the reason he signed was to play with Dame so hed be upset if Dame left.

Anfernee &amp; Nassir are Killing it!@MagnumTam @trailblazers Good question too! I watch their Miami game 2 wks ago, there was a scuffle w/Hero &amp; Nurk and everyone was around them while Norm is just @ the background holding the ball minding his own!
