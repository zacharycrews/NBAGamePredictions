A scary thought for the rest of the NBA: The @cavs are only 1.5 games out of the top spot in the Eastern Conference, and they don't believe they've played their best basketball yet.

They are on a four game losing streak, but still in first place in the East. They need to take care of business against a solid Cleveland Cavaliers team at home tonight. #Bullsnation@stephenasmith @KingJames @cavs Simple answer. Next time Brooklyn plays in Cleveland, there is a vaccine requirement. Stop letting this bum play on the road.@BallySportsCLE @cavs Would be great if I could actually watch itAs important as tonight's game is in the standings, J.B. Bickerstaff's primary focus for the @cavs is playing a consistent 48 minutes and sticking to their identity.

#GamblingTwitter@MichelobULTRA Cleveland Cavaliers!!@stephenasmith @KingJames @cavs Why are yall arguing lmao its pretty simple that lebron and kyrie needed eachother to win a chip if one or the other wearnt there they wouldn't have one lmao@ChicagoThaGoat @_dnaiel_ @Kashta9 @stephenasmith @KingJames @cavs They both contributed greatly to beating a 73-9 team down 3-1

As teammates both put up historic numbers as a duo we’ve never seen b4 under the circumstances

Both had to be clutch and both were

Both delivered at an elite level

No Kyrie no comeback, no Bron no comeback, simple@lbcisjustbetter @stephenasmith @KingJames @cavs I don’t believe that’s true. Anything to back it up?@NBAHoopLoop @_dnaiel_ @Kashta9 @stephenasmith @KingJames @cavs Kyrie fanboys are delusional@NBAHoopLoop @_dnaiel_ @Kashta9 @stephenasmith @KingJames @cavs Kyrie can't even make the playoffs or finish a season but he winning people rings?@stephenasmith @KingJames @cavs They are just bitter about the Browns right now 🤭@SouledOut007216 @cavs @kevinlove @heyitsdaveralph Thanks they’re from @shadyrays 
I like the look but the quality is crap. I guess when you offer a free replacement on every purchase that’s the route you have to take@NBAHoopLoop @_dnaiel_ @Kashta9 @stephenasmith @KingJames @cavs Boy I'm older than you &amp; actually Bron did that what is your argument when LeBron lead both teams in every category hell Kyrie wasn't even the last one to score it was LeBron who made it a 2possession game &amp; Bron has done it before &amp; after Kyrie so if anyone is on nuts it's you@FanoftheLand13 @stephenasmith @KingJames @cavs I know a lot of Cavs fans being from the area and there are many that dislike Kyrie. But of course that’s a small sample size. My guess it’s probably like 70-30@ARodsburner @stephenasmith @KingJames @cavs W hope the packers win the super bowl@RealImaniB @stephenasmith @KingJames @cavs The narrative that Lebron won it would be false to, both notions are disrespectful, it’s always taken 2+ Allstars and Kyrie showed up@SouledOut007216 @cavs @kevinlove @heyitsdaveralph Yeah i went to HS with Dave. We weren’t really close but i always liked him 🙂. I think i was maybe two classes ahead of him@ChicagoThaGoat @_dnaiel_ @Kashta9 @stephenasmith @KingJames @cavs The goal was to win a championship and Kyrie did that, get off Lebrons nuts little boy@stephenasmith @KingJames @cavs Kyrie deserves this. He let Cleveland when they needed him the most at the height of the Warriors era. He hasn't done anything since.@stephenasmith @KingJames @cavs Here we go 😂@NBAHoopLoop @stephenasmith @KingJames @cavs I’m not trying to diminish Kyrie at all.. I believe he is top 2 PG in the league when healthy. But the notion or narrative that Kyrie won that chip for Cleveland or Bron is false.@stephenasmith @KingJames @cavs Get vaccinated or get heckled@RatedREscobar @_dnaiel_ @Kashta9 @stephenasmith @KingJames @cavs My point is it was less than LeBron as a matter of fact the point really makes itself@NBAHoopLoop @_dnaiel_ @Kashta9 @stephenasmith @KingJames @cavs I didn't know having more than Curry was the goal but regardless LeBron lead the team in every Category Kyries performance could have been done my several other Brons not so muchBreadHeadBets:

It’s not that deep 🤦@stephenasmith @KingJames @cavs No lies detected here…@stephenasmith @KingJames @cavs So Kyrie rolls up in a NETS jersey and wants the Cleveland fans to love on him like he’s one of theirs?  Thanks for the chip, Kyrie. But you left to chase another one in a different town.  Don’t be butt hurt.@RealImaniB @stephenasmith @KingJames @cavs He did it was cute, Kyrie did that and MORE

Y’all need to stop trying to diminish that man@stephenasmith @KingJames @cavs Best thing Stephen A has ever said 💯@BrownsWin330 @cavs @kevinlove @heyitsdaveralph Sup Dizzy you know Dave? I dig your shades broDear @NBA ,

Please adopt the ability to flex the schedule for nationally televised games like the NFL.

We don’t need to watch the Celtics and Knicks every week when teams like the @cavs are playing better basketball and challenging for 1st place in the East.

Thanks,
The Fans@BlakCasanova @stephenasmith @KingJames @cavs Kyrie was dropping 40 in the crucial games as well, soooooooo.....@stephenasmith @KingJames @cavs He quit on us Stephen. That’s all that matters now. He quit on us.@stephenasmith @KingJames @cavs Dear Stephen.  One fan does not speak for all of us. Just like the 5 peeps that burned their LeBron jerseys, those 5 idiots do not represent sent the majority of Cavs fans. You are smarter than that.  Please don’t jump on that bandwagon.Just a totally massive slate of games in the NBA tonight!! Biggest game is @cavs visiting first place @chicagobulls ! With a win by the Cavs and wins by the @BrooklynNets and @MiamiHEAT there would be a 3 way tie for first in the East and the Cavs only 2 games back!@stephenasmith @KingJames @cavs ….and Kyrie wouldn’t have won a chip without Cleveland… it goes both ways@NBAHoopLoop @stephenasmith @KingJames @cavs Huh? Steve Kerr hit the game-winning shot against the Utah Jazz in Game 6 of the 97 NBA Finals. Which won the Bulls thief 5th title. If it wasn’t for that shot, who knows if the bulls would have been able to finish that off.. that shot was pivotal!!Wednesday's NBA matchup features a marquee showdown between the Chicago Bulls and Cleveland Cavaliers. How did the two Eastern Conference heavyweights get here?

#BullsNation | #LetEmKnow | #NBATwitter | @getsMart_5  https://t.co/6M17hICjPb@stephenasmith @KingJames @cavs He demanded a trade then ripped the city after he left. I respect guys like Tristan Thompson, did nothing but compliment the team and city after he left. professional. Guys like Kyrie who talk shit after they leave and do nothing after that get no respect after he left l. Stupid.@stephenasmith @KingJames @cavs Of all the good things about the Cavs you could tweet,you choose to show what one fan said.Gotta get those likes I guess....smh@cavs @MarketDistrict @MichelobULTRA @dariusgarland22 @GiantEagle Can y’all send me one I am quarantined rn until next week@stephenasmith @KingJames @cavs Dude, much of Cleveland loves Kyrie for 2016. Don’t generalize because of one fan.@stephenasmith @KingJames @cavs Take Lebron out then let’s talk@stephenasmith @KingJames @cavs Your just a lebron hater admitt it@stephenasmith @KingJames @cavs They’re mad because the way Kyrie left the Cavs.@stephenasmith @KingJames @cavs Agreed but he sets a bad leaugue example for being a part time player and a bad teammate. How many teams he gonna destroy.@stephenasmith @KingJames @cavs Theres bad seeds in every fanbase. The majority of us appreciate Kyrie for what he did for the Cavs.@lbcisjustbetter @stephenasmith @KingJames @cavs Everyone knows Kyrie got tired of riding Lebron’s coattails and wanted to be the main star.  He couldn’t even sniff the playoffs until Lebron arrivedTwo bets that i like a lot tonight..
Cleveland Cavaliers 1Q -1 (-105)
Mavs/Tor 1q o53.5 (-115)@Kashta9 @_dnaiel_ @stephenasmith @KingJames @cavs So 10 other players would’ve felt with lebrons feminine/annoying antics and personality and dropped 40 against the best team in the league?Im Getting drunk tonight for the @cavs game. Who's with me?@RealImaniB @stephenasmith @KingJames @cavs Take Kerr name out and it’s acceptable, otherwise delusional@stephenasmith @KingJames @cavs So we are going to ignore the standing O his 1st game back as a Net? Even after he held the organization hostage &amp; bashed the fan base after? Also, majority of floor-seaters are douches that either dad bought em or they “could’ve made the NBA if their HS Coach didn’t hate them.”@stephenasmith @KingJames @cavs Agreed, Kyrie is a Baaaad Man, and is the main reason the Cavs won a title in my opinion.@MichelobULTRA Cleveland Cavaliers@lbcisjustbetter @stephenasmith @KingJames @cavs Thats just fantasy land.  In 16 Cavs won the 🏆and Kyrie played 53 games.  In 17 Kyrie played 72 games and avg 25.2 points per game that season.  The highest of his career to that point.  Kyrie bailed the following season and threatened season ending surgery to get out of town.@lanamarie27 @cavs I’m going with 70s style velour pullover I started wearing during the west coast trip
Can’t stop now@Kashta9 @stephenasmith @KingJames @cavs Disagree! Kyrie was cold blooded in those games! Yes to your point about Lebron put Kyrie was incredible@Mrfjetter @stephenasmith @KingJames @cavs Wtf does this have to do with anything? Also Steve Kerr was an all star? Lmao@stephenasmith @KingJames @cavs L without Kyrie for sure! He was spectacular!@stephenasmith @KingJames @cavs Such a dumb statement. KD doesn’t win w/o Curry, Bird w/o Mchale, Jordan w/o Pippen. No one has to Respect Kyrie@ericpenate @stephenasmith @KingJames @cavs if Bron or Kyrie ain’t there they don’t win shit@stephenasmith @KingJames @cavs OH STOP IT!! A few fans don't speak for the masses!! Speak on those who said it! So tired of the disrespect you and others give Cleveland. A few don't speak for the MANY!!@stephenasmith @KingJames @cavs For all cavs fans please hold LeBron accountable for his actions. He tried to trade Kyrie for Criss Paul and Kyrie got wind of it forced his way out of town before LeBron left, nuff said!1/20/22

Because of that, I have a soft spot for the Browns &amp; the Indians. Originally, I started following the Cavs because they wore white and blue. As simple as that. Carrying my Evertonian blue over in to Basketball.@stephenasmith @KingJames @cavs You really are a joke Stephen A. Maybe the fan out of line as a cavs fan I’m thankful and thankful for jr. But you don’t say anything about how he uses language to a kid etc. otherwise I would agree. But you know what he makes 40 million that was nothing. Pipe down. 12M joke. Lol@stephenasmith @KingJames @cavs I agree  Scored dagger in Game 7  Both he and LeBron had 40+ in Game 5  A very good sidekick, but not true #1 option  Needs LeBron, Durant ... etx#1 &amp; #2 meet in the #NBA Central Division standings, tonight at 8pm. I'm rooting for the hometown team! #GoCavs #Cavs #Cleveland @cavs https://t.co/6C41MD6wqr@stephenasmith @KingJames @cavs Then why ask to be traded if that’s the case?

I’d like to match my team if I’m going to get kicked out of the United Center@stephenasmith @KingJames @cavs Let’s talk this out… if Bron Bron doesn’t come back to the Cavs and it’s only Kyrie??? Cleveland has no title, Warriors don’t get Durant, and possibly win 5 straight@stephenasmith @KingJames @cavs Nah its petty and undermines his spirit of the game. You don't tarnish your own championship and ONLY championship because some fans talk smack. I used to really like Kyrie now he has to be one of the least likeable athletes in sports. He doesn't care, but he should@stephenasmith @KingJames @cavs We all love kyrie in Cleveland that one fan is a just a rich prick as you can see he's sitting court side@stephenasmith @KingJames @cavs Did they sniff the playoffs before @KingJames returned he hit the shot but without bron we wouldn’t even been there But we’re ungrateful lol what about those 4 years before 23 supporting you with no sign of the playoffs get yo panties out a bunch and ball well not in ny@stephenasmith @KingJames @cavs He also said he wouldn’t leave and then forced his way out and shortly after joined a super teamcleveland cavaliers@stephenasmith @KingJames @cavs These dorks don’t speak for all of Cleveland.@stephenasmith @KingJames @cavs As a LeBron fan I can't disagree, both played some of the best basketball of their lives to get that ringWednesday NBA🏀

HE DID IT, he put in the work he hit the shots he fried Klay Curry Iggy etc

While Curry watched the opposing PG outperform him.

Lebron and Kyrie both very clearly won that ring together..it’s not even a debate 😂@stephenasmith @KingJames @cavs No doubt, Kyrie played that night !!@stephenasmith @KingJames @cavs Slow news day for this to be a story?Kyrie Irving Unloads on Cleveland Cavaliers Fan for Heckling Him: 'Motherf*ckers Still Ungrateful' https://t.co/0wpw4hn4Ke@stephenasmith @KingJames @cavs Hell not, he's overrated@NBAHoopLoop @stephenasmith @KingJames @cavs why, because I don't have "NBA" in my name? https://t.co/RU43mCmTLV@stephenasmith @KingJames @cavs He request a trade and destroy the team never forget@stephenasmith @KingJames @cavs Let's not forget how Kyrie talked bad about Cleveland not being a real sports town after forcing his way out.

Sickening ...@ChargeCLE @RajonRondo @cavs Is rondo the best charge player ever?@danny_weis12 @stephenasmith @KingJames @cavs @RealJayWilliams He’s always been consistent about his play.@stephenasmith @KingJames @cavs Cleveland and Ohio in general has a horrible fan base and has no loyalty the way my state treated him when he left was ridiculous then gobbled his meat when he came back smh@stephenasmith @KingJames @cavs The problem for fans is 2 things. First is Kyrie asked to be traded. That's never going to sit well with fans. Second is Kyrie is extremely unlikable. Dude doesn't show up to work so your average hard working American isn't going to be ok with that.@stephenasmith @KingJames @cavs Stephen A kissing Kyrie ass now! 😂 he’s pathetic….. Kyrie is who we think he is…..@P_Potamus @PanUmarist @ItBegins2012 @stephenasmith @KingJames @cavs Are they throwing pads? https://t.co/Vefa2YuPfX@stephenasmith @KingJames @cavs Captain obvious😅@tlbjr_25 @stephenasmith @KingJames @cavs He’s never hated on his ability to play ball.  He’s been consistent with that from what I saw.@JennyRrocks @stephenasmith @KingJames @cavs He literally hit the free throw to ice the championship. Wtf are you talking about?Glooks @cavs for the free tix

That doesn’t equate to winning the chip for them 😭😭😭@DonovanCarpen14 @JohnWall @cavs They got Darius and Rondo already they don’t need 3 pg’s@stephenasmith @KingJames @cavs Why bring @KingJames into this?

#WildGooseWLBY #GetToTheGoose @ The Wild Goose https://t.co/TD1ny0YsWg@TherealHassanO @stephenasmith @KingJames @cavs LeBron scored 16 pts in a row in the 4th qtr.
Y'all buggin and need to put some respect on The Ling's name.@stephenasmith @KingJames @cavs Ohhh he can pop his stuff but when people clap back he mad. Remember being a professional ball player of what have you done for me lately. Sir you e done nothing for Cleveland since. It’s ok gotta take the good and bad.@stephenasmith @KingJames @cavs Years Irving played before James return we could sit anywhere at the Q. When he came home couldn't find a ticket without paying big $@stephenasmith @KingJames @cavs Nobody cares what u think mf🤦🏽‍♂️@stephenasmith @KingJames @cavs Me too, poor fandom there, and also, go @cavs #letemknow@_dnaiel_ @Kashta9 @stephenasmith @KingJames @cavs How much did he have in game 7? Cause Bron had a TD with more points, Rebounds, Assist, Steals and Blocks@stephenasmith @KingJames @cavs If James went to Boston and played with that talent there...FINALS!@stephenasmith @KingJames @cavs Kyrie Irving got a song from a local Cleveland artist. Bron don’t have a song. A few hecklers don’t speak for Cleveland. Secondly, you forget Lebrun got his jersey burned here. Cleveland don’t take breakups well.@stephenasmith @KingJames @cavs What has he done since?@4DSoulMusic @stephenasmith @KingJames @cavs better than a"nothingship." https://t.co/2HkvpEtstp@Bens_head_space @stephenasmith @KingJames @cavs That AD won@SarnAgampreet @stephenasmith @KingJames @cavs Think what? I haven’t posted any opinion here haha@stephenasmith @KingJames @cavs no they deserve equal credit Kyrie hit the damn Game winner@Ninjaz567 @ItBegins2012 @stephenasmith @KingJames @cavs Mans said begged lmao@stephenasmith @KingJames @cavs Lmao. Kyrie is nothing before and after playing with LeBron, hasnt won shit, didnt even get to finals without bron.@Bens_head_space @stephenasmith @KingJames @cavs A bubbleship@stephenasmith @KingJames @cavs @stephenasmith everyone stopped caring what you think around October last year. FYI@stephenasmith @KingJames @cavs Pip never averaged more than 22 in the finals....@pickempickemBEN @BarstoolBigCat @BSSportsbook Your Cleveland….CAVALIERS!@stephenasmith @KingJames @cavs Keep cheering for the Knicks bro..just keep cheering.@Pickupthepiece2 @marzdarz @ItBegins2012 @stephenasmith @KingJames @cavs Daniel Gibson Alonzo gee Thompson  varejao KI was supposed to go where?
1 superstar 0allstars at the time vs 3 superstars(KLOVE KI LBJ) and a team full of allstars ! 🤦🏾‍♂️Brain damage- Eminem@stephenasmith @KingJames @cavs King James got him a ring!@stephenasmith @KingJames @cavs The absence of KYRIE feels like it will cost the NETS a championship.@stephenasmith @KingJames @cavs Y’all are hilarious… Kyrie won that chip like Steve Karr and or Pippen won Chicago chips.. they simply played their part… but if you take Bron off of that team they aren’t in the playoffs infect they would be a lottery pick team! Bottom line.. stop the 🧢@stephenasmith @KingJames @cavs We can thank kyrie for what he did while he was a cavalier, but I’m not gonna praise him while he wears a different team across his chest. I will thank him, shake his hand, then boo him and hope his team loses.@JalenHtx @ItBegins2012 @bt_ramy @stephenasmith @KingJames @cavs Nah but 1 shot means Kyrie was better https://t.co/T9xQsVqb2j@stephenasmith @KingJames @cavs Cleveland had a chance at a dynasty. Kyrie decided that he didn’t want to play second fiddle to anyone, threw a fit and demanded a trade. That was the first step in dismantling the team. He may have been critical to the title, but he also destroyed the team from within.@stephenasmith @KingJames @cavs I agreed sir@Cam_Miller_23 @stephenasmith @KingJames @cavs What does that have to do with anything. Tell the reason why, Bron tried to trade him to Phx. So he expedited the process. Better than what Bron has done to the Lakers, no young talent or draft picks. They gonna suck for years to come thx to Bron. But they got a bubble ring 🤣🤣@stephenasmith @KingJames @cavs @KingJames would be 3-7 in Finals without Kyrie's shot.. simple@CHISportsFann @HighChanceImHi @TheCollinsWay @MalcomRiley22 Yes, and I play for the Cleveland Cavaliers...@stephenasmith @KingJames @cavs He’s a turd. It’s really hard to like the guy even if he did help win us a title finally. Even tho before Lebron he couldn’t get us out of a top 4 lottery pick.@theScore @cavs Funny thing is, He's signing with y'all next season@stephenasmith @KingJames @cavs There's always gonna be a heckler somewhere someway some how. It's nothing new. And 1 person's actions don't make everyone guilty of it.@stephenasmith @KingJames @cavs I don’t know why America listen to Stephen A ! All what comes from his mouth is bullshit if he talks about NBA@stephenasmith @KingJames @cavs How many did he win in Boston and Brooklyn..crickets chirping@stephenasmith @KingJames @cavs Stephen A!!! You plays for the enemy!! You know how that goes!! I've heard you clamor for players to play like they used to.  Not my team = enemy!!@stephenasmith @KingJames @cavs LeBron got them to the title with and without Kyrie. It’s how he left is why he’s getting crap. Do I agree with it, NO! But there’s always an idiot out there waiting to pounce on someone who draws attention to themselves because of their behavior whether you like it or not!@stephenasmith @KingJames @cavs You don't get the dagger without the block! He didn't win shit! All hail King James 4life!@stephenasmith @KingJames @cavs Can’t be in finals if you don’t get to playoffs and Kyrie didn’t do that@stephenasmith @KingJames @cavs Kyrie bailed on a championship team.  That’s what he gets.  It’s hard to stay grateful when you bail during the small championship window that you have.  Especially in Cleveland.  And let’s not forget.  It’s was Lebron’s block on Iguodala that was most iconic play in that seriesBasketball - NBA

Lebron certainly wasn’t gonna do anything in the last 4 minutes.@stephenasmith @KingJames @cavs Huh??? Kyrie had our team in lottery picks.

GTFOH@stephenasmith @KingJames @cavs That’s like giving most of the credit to David Tyree’s helmet catch in that Super Bowl over the quarterback.
 Yes, the catch and shot was critical but without @KingJames and the quarterback setting up those plays (per say), the helmet catch and the shot does not happen‼️@stephenasmith @KingJames @cavs Wrong, cavs don’t even get to the playoffs with out bron@6_rasean @JasonM_VII @Stvn___ @WhistleSports @RTNBA @cavs So you think Dan Gilbert’s cheap ass is gonna give Garland a $181 million contract extension this summer?@stephenasmith @KingJames @cavs To be fair, what’s one title to a city of champs such as Cleveland?@ItBegins2012 @bt_ramy @stephenasmith @KingJames @cavs You're a casual for focusing on 2 plays in one game out of the Finals as a whole.

it's always better to trade superstars than let them walk in free agency. look at houston, okc, etc@VertexHybridd @Pickupthepiece2 @ItBegins2012 @stephenasmith @KingJames @cavs No, I'm not.

Everyone’s soft af now. Dudes making millions and talked hella shit about Cleveland on his way out@stephenasmith @KingJames @cavs Cavs fans do appreciate Kyrie but he chose to leave and he still plays in league against Cavs.  Until he is retired, or a Cavs player again, he will get heckled by Cavs fans. I for one will not but fans will fan but majority are thankful for what Kyrie did for city@stephenasmith @KingJames @cavs We Cavs fan know that Kyrie was important in our title run. If we had Ky on the first finals we probably smocked the Warriors that year.@stephenasmith @KingJames @cavs Y’all judging by one dumb shmuck talking shit on sideline.

Same vibe......👇🏾 https://t.co/nLg7C8dhz1@ed_in_columbus Yes remember the shot. I thought for sure the Cavs would have Ron Harper defend Michael. In reality it probably wouldn’t of mattered though.

As if fans judge developed a grudge against him out of thin air 🤣.@stephenasmith @KingJames @cavs 1000% accurate.@stephenasmith @KingJames @cavs I mean, that’s the same place that burned LeBrons jerseys and then begged for him back.Alex Caruso and Tyler Cook are available for tonight’s game against the Cleveland Cavaliers. #BullsNation@bebogonzalez97 @stephenasmith @KingJames @cavs That’s not even a bad take lebron lead the team in almost every statistical category in the playoffs.@ItBegins2012 @stephenasmith @KingJames @cavs Just like Kerr and Paxton won Jordan Chips by hitting game winners in the finals Game 6 ‘93 and ‘97 to win the Championship@stephenasmith @KingJames @cavs He forced his way out in the prime of his career when they were a championship team. How else are they supposed to feel? 😂😂@ItBegins2012 @stephenasmith @KingJames @cavs Wasn’t Cleveland a lottery team with Kyrie@stephenasmith @KingJames @cavs Why?  That don't mean shit. He quit on that city so they quit on him. Fair to me@stephenasmith @KingJames @cavs The city of Cleveland will never be able to keep a superstar caliber player long term again@stephenasmith @KingJames @cavs This is a very Cleveland fans thing to do lol@stephenasmith @KingJames @cavs A rare dub from Stephen A.@stephenasmith @KingJames @cavs You dont just talk to Clevelanders like this.

Stephen a only motive was to come at lebron in this tweet@stephenasmith @KingJames @cavs I’m not obliged to love anyone who helps my team win a title for the remainder of their lives if they start acting stupid like he has. 

And now he’s crying about players playing good defense because he “could get hurt”? 

What conspiracy will he be linked to next?@Beretoooo @stephenasmith @KingJames @cavs I never had a Stephen A Smith agenda@stephenasmith @KingJames @cavs Nah he don’t rock with u bro@stephenasmith @KingJames @cavs I agree Stephen A @stephenasmith@CavsJMike @cavs @BallySportsCLE @MrCavalier34 @SerenaWinters Not inconceivable that Cavs could be in 1st place by the end of the month, given then schedule@Cam_Miller_23 @stephenasmith @KingJames @cavs Kyrie is more communicative with this fan than he was with his Cleveland teammates at the end 
https://t.co/NUGsJ2tEvL@Kashta9 @stephenasmith @KingJames @cavs There aint ten players putting up 40 points in the finals against the best defense in the league@stephenasmith @KingJames @cavs I’m personally thankful for the part Kyrie played in that championship, but let’s not act like Kyrie is innocent here.@stephenasmith @KingJames @cavs Appreciate?

Come on @stephenasmith be better.@SareesDad @stephenasmith @KingJames @cavs Yea they did@stephenasmith @KingJames @cavs How are we just ignoring how Kyrie held the org hostage by threatening to get knee surgery and demanding a trade? He then proceeded to bash CLE every opportunity he got and avoided playing in the city for as long as possible@stephenasmith @KingJames @cavs You?? Agreed with Kyrie??? I’m in shock@stephenasmith @KingJames @cavs That’s the past - what has Kyrie done lately?@stephenasmith @KingJames @cavs I agree with Kyrie as well, Lebron carried a lot but Kyrie also helped a lot. Cleveland fans shouldn’t say shit to those two smfh🥱@stephenasmith @KingJames @cavs Media needs to stop acting like Kyrie is hated by Cleveland. The city loves him still. His first game as a Net in Cleveland he got a standing ovation from the crowd. It’s just one fan who did this. Doesn’t mean Cleveland is ungrateful to Kyrie@stephenasmith @KingJames @cavs Could the 2016 Cavs win with Kemba Walker at PG?@stephenasmith @KingJames @cavs We don’t care what you think you hate Kyrie anyways stop riding beef@stephenasmith @KingJames @cavs Why you do that to Ja man@stephenasmith @KingJames @cavs Not until he get vaccinated@stephenasmith @KingJames @cavs SAS please don't lump a courtside casual in with the real fans man damn!@jmthagoat @stephenasmith @KingJames @cavs Wait, what?

The Cleveland Cavaliers won 33 games in 2013, 53 games in 2014. I guess you could say Mike brown was an awful coach and David Blatt was a great head coach. 

Or they got Lebron James in 2014. 
Depends on what your selling. https://t.co/X3cUihFLvtWhenever a @cavs game ends I immediately start looking forward to the next one. I wish they could play 24/7. #LetEmKnow@CLEsportsTalk Ron Harper- Cleveland Cavaliers traded him away in the late 80s for Danny Ferry- I think he was the missing piece for the Cavs to beat Michael Jordan &amp; the Bulls- instead he ended up with the Bulls &amp; helped them win several NBA Championships@WhistleSports @cavs Especially @espn 🖕Tonight my @chicagobulls play @cavs . I’m hoping my bulls can get back to their winning ways. #BullsNationChicago Bulls - Cleveland Cavaliers

I stream Hulu and have no options to see them 😢My @cavs hot take: 

There’s a real case to be made that by the end of this regular season, @evanmobley could win both 
ROTY AND DPOY. 

This would be the first time a rookie has ever won both. 

He’s a rookie contesting 12.7 shots and blocking 1.7 shots nightly🤯

Badass little part town too@Sebass904 @lsal118 @RMFieldHouse @cavs even put us a few rows forward since usually theres rows and sections in front of us that are completely empty but the monthly pass seats are for row 13 of the mezzanine sections. Thats hardly a demand. Im not “demanding” to be courtside@Sebass904 @lsal118 @RMFieldHouse @cavs Students get deals. Last minute tickets that haven’t sold that are usually $300+ students get for $10-$10 at most. With monthly pass you dont get to pick your seats. The seats are always the worse in the lower arena so itd be nice if for one game they let us pick our seats orIt's crazy how the @cavs are on a five game winning streak but all everyone taking about is Kyrie STILL not getting vexed... and the Lakers being a shell of themselves I mean main stream media are literally going out the way to NOT give them roses smh #LetEmKnow@camijustice @espn is a joke especially since it will take them almost 5 mos to air a @cavs game on their network! For yrs, they reluctantly covered the Cavs cause of LBJ and they hate the fact that we’re relevant again. If I’m wrong, they would’ve already aired a game by now🤠The @cavs &amp; @ZipsMBB BOTH doing BIG THINGS this year.

💪💪💪💪💪💪I see they flexxed the @cavs a @espn game 😎 #putemonnotice #gocavs@lexiaw77 @lsal118 @RMFieldHouse @cavs I find it comparable to when the power goes out at Cedar Point. When this rare occasion happens, you get handed out a return free voucher. This doesn’t normally apply to season pass holders so they get some sort of credit toward purchases in park.@lexiaw77 @lsal118 @RMFieldHouse @cavs Not quite aware how the student pass works but I assume it’s the same as the monthly pass. I stated previously some sort of credit for in arena purchases would be great.@studlyasianmatt @cavs @MarkkanenLauri @betwayusa My friend in N Olmsted said that's the only pizza she'll buy@PBulls_ @gred357 @ComplexSports @LeBatardShow @cavs They both won one......I think lebron has 4 but keep talking.@Sebass904 @lsal118 @RMFieldHouse @cavs I didn’t demand 😂😂😂 i was making a suggestion. I threw an idea out there. Just as i did with a free hot dog or a drink. I’m not demanding anything 😂@Sebass904 @lsal118 @RMFieldHouse @cavs Okay so my question remains. Should people who buy cheap loudville or buy with student pass also not get anything because of everything yesterday???Then he went and blew up a potential dynasty... Cavs fans have every right to still dislike him #LetEmKnow @cavs https://t.co/RdcBjl10c9@lexiaw77 @lsal118 @RMFieldHouse @cavs No they just get anther free ticket. It’s not store credit they paid for a ticket they are just replacing it.

I’m fully aware how bad the roads were. The RTA was shut down so i literally had no way to get there like why does it have to be only certain people? Any1 w/ a ticket to yesterday should get helped@Sebass904 @lsal118 @RMFieldHouse @cavs Thats not the point though, you got to use your ticket, people who bought single tickets are getting essentially store credit. Monthly pass users can’t get that. So they should get slightly better seats or a free drink or a free hot dog or something since@Sebass904 @lsal118 @RMFieldHouse @cavs Only 7 games actually in January. So people who bought student tickets shouldn’t get any of it either or people who bought cheap loudville seats shouldnt get it?@cavs @_bigjayy_ @MichelobULTRA That would be sweet!
