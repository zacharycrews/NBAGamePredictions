Steve Kerr hit the game-winning shot against the¬†Utah Jazz in Game 6 of the¬†97 NBA Finals. Which won the Bulls thief 5th title.

Bottom line.. stop the üß¢@stephenasmith @KingJames @cavs We can thank kyrie for what he did while he was a cavalier, but I‚Äôm not gonna praise him while he wears a different team across his chest. I will thank him, shake his hand, then boo him and hope his team loses.@JalenHtx @ItBegins2012 @bt_ramy @stephenasmith @KingJames @cavs Nah but 1 shot means Kyrie was better https://t.co/T9xQsVqb2j@stephenasmith @KingJames @cavs Cleveland had a chance at a dynasty. Kyrie decided that he didn‚Äôt want to play second fiddle to anyone, threw a fit and demanded a trade. That was the first step in dismantling the team. He may have been critical to the title, but he also destroyed the team from within.@stephenasmith @KingJames @cavs I agreed sir@Cam_Miller_23 @stephenasmith @KingJames @cavs What does that have to do with anything. Tell the reason why, Bron tried to trade him to Phx. So he expedited the process. Better than what Bron has done to the Lakers, no young talent or draft picks. They gonna suck for years to come thx to Bron. But they got a bubble ring ü§£ü§£@stephenasmith @KingJames @cavs @KingJames would be 3-7 in Finals without Kyrie's shot.. simple@CHISportsFann @HighChanceImHi @TheCollinsWay @MalcomRiley22 Yes, and I play for the Cleveland Cavaliers...@stephenasmith @KingJames @cavs He‚Äôs a turd.

Or they got Lebron James in 2014.

Badass little part town too@Sebass904 @lsal118 @RMFieldHouse @cavs even put us a few rows forward since usually theres rows and sections in front of us that are completely empty but the monthly pass seats are for row 13 of the mezzanine sections. Thats hardly a demand. Im not ‚Äúdemanding‚Äù to be courtside@Sebass904 @lsal118 @RMFieldHouse @cavs Students get deals. Last minute tickets that haven‚Äôt sold that are usually $300+ students get for $10-$10 at most. With monthly pass you dont get to pick your seats. The seats are always the worse in the lower arena so itd be nice if for one game they let us pick our seats orIt's crazy how the @cavs are on a five game winning streak but all everyone taking about is Kyrie STILL not getting vexed... and the Lakers being a shell of themselves I mean main stream media are literally going out the way to NOT give them roses smh #LetEmKnow@camijustice @espn is a joke especially since it will take them almost 5 mos to air a @cavs game on their network!

https://t.co/w4qJm1AN5b@lexiaw77 @lsal118 @RMFieldHouse @cavs You got games for both February and January. I know this because I was looking into it.@camfromthe216 A cm of a bulls fan page just say to me the Cleveland Cavaliers are a "shitty franchise" just cuz of that smh ü§¶@Sebass904 @lsal118 @RMFieldHouse @cavs We also didn‚Äôt get to use our tickets like some single ticketed people yesterday. I‚Äôm fully aware how bad the roads were. The RTA was shut down so i literally had no way to get there like why does it have to be only certain people? Any1 w/ a ticket to yesterday should get helped@Sebass904 @lsal118 @RMFieldHouse @cavs Thats not the point though, you got to use your ticket, people who bought single tickets are getting essentially store credit. Monthly pass users can‚Äôt get that. So they should get slightly better seats or a free drink or a free hot dog or something since@Sebass904 @lsal118 @RMFieldHouse @cavs Only 7 games actually in January. So people who bought student tickets shouldn‚Äôt get any of it either or people who bought cheap loudville seats shouldnt get it?@cavs @_bigjayy_ @MichelobULTRA That would be sweet!
@_bigjayy_ @cavs @MichelobULTRA@cavs @Raptors @RMFieldHouse @ESPNNBA Should be a good game. The Raptors are still a tough team.2003 Bowman LeBron James Rookie Card #123 RC Cleveland Cavaliers - https://t.co/XDK9ODE9HO

He played college basketball for the Texas Longhorns. Allen was selected 22nd overall by the Brooklyn Nets in the 2017 NBA draft. https://t.co/jeLxRCUyA0@madisondkerley @cavs @MarkkanenLauri @betwayusa @OhioPieCo for sure@Chico923TheFan @cavs @MarkkanenLauri @betwayusa @masterpizza Depending where he lives I say absolutely.@cavs @MarkkanenLauri @betwayusa You are doing amazing and this team has really shown a team chemistry that we haven't had since the late 80's.  thank you for the attitude of TEAM.

Cleveland fans are among the most loyal in the country. Even after LeBron left the 2nd time, they were 6th in tv ratings.Hour four of today's SportsTalk featured @JWilkersonWNML &amp; @VinceSports talking all things @NBA with The Voice of The Cleveland @cavs, UT baseball with #Vols HC Tony Vitello and more on the day's top sports stories.¬†¬†https://t.co/EOmXTo94ea@cavs @Raptors @RMFieldHouse @ESPNNBA Flex time baby!@cavs @MarkkanenLauri @betwayusa Romeos!@cavs @MarkkanenLauri @betwayusa Hey @MarkkanenLauri how about we start a pizza sampling around Clevekand?@monstershockey @tyler_angle7 @SportsCenter sheeeesh@cavs @MarkkanenLauri @betwayusa No doubt @masterpizza@Chico923TheFan @cavs @MarkkanenLauri @betwayusa @masterpizza Master is very underrated!!@_FOCUSonthebeat @Groovy_Sidd @J_Tatum4 @ComplexSports See @cavs @Browns @CleGuardians @ClevelandGolf @ClevelandClinic No one likes Cleveland@cavs @MarkkanenLauri @betwayusa Godmothers@Its_RA_99 @cavs fun is infinite@cavs @MarkkanenLauri @betwayusa Athens Pizza@ComplexSports ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just one‚Äù

I‚Äôll buy another freaking app before I switch back to cable!!!@cavs @MarkkanenLauri @betwayusa This Greek guy I know named Cesar makes a great affordable pie. Always has it hot and ready. Short guy, can‚Äôt miss him.@lexiaw77 @lsal118 @RMFieldHouse @cavs Tell me who it would impact more, those who spent $89 for 10 games or those who spent $40 for a single game for the same seats.@lexiaw77 @lsal118 @RMFieldHouse @cavs Why should someone who only paid 8.99 for yesterdays game get their seats upgraded any more than those who paid $40 for a single game just to miss half of it?Nah, that shit ain't cool. @KyrieIrving is the man, regardless of some of things he says. His efforts for the @cavs aren't forgotten by real Cavs fans. This guy ain't one. https://t.co/7pL1thmD7w@cavs @MarkkanenLauri @betwayusa il rione!!LOS ANGELES (AFP) ‚Äî Darius Garland scored 22 points and delivered 12 assists as the Cleveland Cavaliers stretched their winning streak to five games with a 114-107 win over the Brooklyn Nets on Monday. https://t.co/Ff01q82zJC@cavs @socios Of course the Cavs 1st W of the season! https://t.co/QT42fKveMELike bro, the Cleveland Cavaliers have never won (or appeared in) the NBA Finals without Kyrie Irving on the roster and the man got the nerve to talk to Kyrie like this is the Lakers. That‚Äôs like me trash talking Earl ‚ÄúThe Pearl‚Äù@cavs @MarkkanenLauri @betwayusa @MarkkanenLauri you have to try Angelo‚Äôs pizza in Lakewood!@cavs @MarkkanenLauri @betwayusa He should try Ginas. Very good New York Style pizza.@lexiaw77 @lsal118 @RMFieldHouse @cavs I was someone who went to yesterdays game. The roads in Cleveland were so bad that it took an hour for me and my cousin to get from the exit ramp of I-90 to get to our parking spot at the Jack casino. We didn‚Äôt get into the game until halftime because of how bad it wasGot any local pizza recommendations for @MarkkanenLauri? üçï
