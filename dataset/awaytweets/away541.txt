I just loved seeing the evolution. Somewhere in there he thought, "nope, that won't work" or it didn't meet his standards. Made a pivot and still killed it!

Here’s what I think happened: Sometimes, if I don’t get in the studio to give feedback, Pierick will “start over” on certain (or all! 😱) parts of a piece bc he didn’t like how it looked. 

That’d be my guess for what happened to LJ’s leg/shoe. LolWashington wizards versus Charlotte hornets, will the wizards cover their 4th straight game

New years was yesterday, guys. You are not just getting beat, you are getting mauled a.k. run out of your building. You are like a bunch of amateurs playing the pros. A lot of guys on this team are there for that SC highlight reel. You play defence like stuff in skirts"It's going to boil down to our compete level increasing."

Not sure how to make them care.@aumore5 @hornets @NovantHealth He baby him too much look at other teams with the pg they don’t punish them they let them growHALFTIME: #Suns 73, #Hornets 47

Charlotte outscored 37-20 in the second quarterI’m kinda glad I didn’t go to that Suns vs Hornets game tonight! Getting ugly in Charlotte 👀@hornets @NovantHealth Did we or did we not just spend an entire practice on defense?LaMelo needs to leave @hornets.  One simple turnover and he gets yanked from the game for Ish Smith who has two turnovers.  Terry Rozier plays no defense but has a bunch of energy on offense.  Borrego is a horrible coach.@hornets @NovantHealth No fucking way@NBACanada @hornets Just pretend the Bobcats period never existed.@jlaxsr01 @hornets @NovantHealth Still they never lead big against teams unless it’s a really bad team… and every win is a close oneI can't recall a game where @MELOD1P had ZERO assists in the whole first half??!!
It's time to break out the #WeWantGELO chants again, if nobody can catch and shoot consistently  !!!?! @Hornets.@hornets @NovantHealth Halftime show - what if she missed that target? I didn't see any safety shield 🏹@KC704CLT @hornets @NovantHealth it’s not that deep lmaooo@Pajita06 @hornets @NovantHealth This is what the suns should do to us. We play no defense and everyone on our offense is streaky at best.@hornets @NovantHealth I knew we weren't winning this but can we at least lose by 10 instead of 20+ 💀@camutdforever @hornets @NovantHealth Suns best team in NBA… tough opponent@JTM876K @NBACanada @hornets thats technically an older pelicans logo 😬@hornets @NovantHealth Plumbee can’t get a rebound to save his career.

Phoenix hit a season-best 20 3Ps last time they faced Charlotte. Cam Johnson gets the start with Crowder out. He's shooting 50% from three on 6.8 attempts in his last five games. Watch for him to have a big game.Consensus Line Move:
