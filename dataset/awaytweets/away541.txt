I just loved seeing the evolution. Somewhere in there he thought, "nope, that won't work" or it didn't meet his standards. Made a pivot and still killed it!

New years was yesterday, guys. You are not just getting beat, you are getting mauled a.k. run out of your building. You are like a bunch of amateurs playing the pros. A lot of guys on this team are there for that SC highlight reel. You play defence like stuff in skirts"It's going to boil down to our compete level increasing."

Assistant Coach Marlon Garnett catches up with @ashahahmadi to talk about what needs to improve in the second half.

#AllFly | @hornets https://t.co/v7zkVU8o2rIs there a way for the Suns to face the Hornets one more time?
