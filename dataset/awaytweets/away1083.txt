https://t.co/kpjqTyHpdT@Stillncrj1 @ushervincent893 @jcallins @ATLHawks If that’s what u think then that’s fine …but Schlenk didn’t build depth just for them to be wasted when injuries occurred and those kids were literally RIGHT THERE to be used! 🤷🏽‍♀️@Stillncrj1 @ushervincent893 @jcallins @ATLHawks Lol we kept a handful of guys while signing a slew of new ones…everyone had to learn each other while learning that system…it took time to gel, Horford got hurt with that shoulder injury and set us back a tad but it wasn’t an easy process tho but they got thru it!Uniforms for Atlanta Hawks vs Detroit Pistons at 4:00 PM.

#ULTRADrip | @MichelobULTRA https://t.co/ZsjfOBDqQO@Stillncrj1 @jcallins @ushervincent893 @ATLHawks Lol he’s on record saying development is DONE! Watching what game?? He only brings those kids up just in case more injuries occurs in that game or one to many fouls out..he is not developing them AT ALL!Atlanta Hawks -4.5  (-110) risking $1,100 to win $1,000@Stillncrj1 @ushervincent893 @jcallins @ATLHawks What do u mean? He was a rookie coach at the time trying to implement his new and complicated system to a crew learning each other…@femaleatlhawk @ushervincent893 @jcallins @ATLHawks Bud came to a team with experienced guys that couldn’t put it together. And he left after that ECF run if I’m not mistaken@femaleatlhawk @ushervincent893 @jcallins @ATLHawks Sounds like you rate the coach on whether he’s doing what you want from the stands. 🤣😂🤣@EricStokesSzn6 @ATLHawks @emoryhealthcare You're a nobody?@Stillncrj1 @ushervincent893 @jcallins @ATLHawks U can assume he left when things got tough but doesn’t mean u are right! The fact that Bud actually WENT thru a rebuild &amp; came out of that bad boy taking this franchise to its 1st ever ECF says a LOT!! It’s OK if he didn’t want to go thru all that again! He put himself on the map@femaleatlhawk @ushervincent893 @jcallins @ATLHawks So what’s buds rotation then? How many guys does he play?@femaleatlhawk @jcallins @ushervincent893 @ATLHawks Like I said some coaches feel watching the game is a form of development. And it will not stop their growth. Fans are just impatient and want what they want when they want it.Play-In Picture: @ATLHawks, @nuggets grab key wins
https://t.co/2JLLtk61g2@Stillncrj1 @ushervincent893 @jcallins @ATLHawks Lol well none of that is how I rate a coach..I rate a coach based on them utilizing ALL AVAILABLE OPTIONS when what they prefer isn’t working…u DONT continue to use what hasn’t worked consistently…@ATLHawks @emoryhealthcare At least Bogi is playing.

thats a very selfish way to think@Lakitu886 @taylor_guyton @ATLHawks @RexChapman I didn't.This was retweeted by @RexChapman &amp;ended up on my timeline.Are you familiar with how Twitter works?Or do u think I love basketball,know all the rules but also purposely called out a rule that I know was called correctly because I'm the fan of whatever the other team is?@ATLHawks @TheTraeYoung But they lost to them Christmas Day.Why the Atlanta Hawks should start Delon Wright #TrueToAtlanta

#AtlantaHawks https://t.co/rXANcMAIQx@Jamieh711 @femaleatlhawk @ATLHawks Exactly@RCWilliams88 @femaleatlhawk @ATLHawks The defense is ranked in the bottom of the league. But the offense is top 5.

Huerter on the other hand worries me. He’s to good of a mid range, outside shooter to be struggling like thisMSG Swag Surfin’ against the Atlanta Hawks is hilarious to me@aussie_beerguy @ATLHawks @RexChapman If you’re not sure, then ask, and don’t phrase it the way you did. You made it seem like the Hawks were gifted a basket that shouldn’t have counted@UnidosdoHawks Isso se chama Atlanta Hawks@RCWilliams88 @femaleatlhawk @ATLHawks That’s really the only time Trae has missed outside is his usually 4 to 5 min rest breaks in the 2nd and 3rd quarters. My point is when the defensive intensity is there this team can and usually beats everyone. But when the defense lacks we usually lose@ATLHawks Get a new center please Clint is lazy"There's something about this stage that brings out the best in Trae Young."

No, I didn't know that because I don't watch basketball. Basketball fans seem really nice though 🤥@ushervincent893 @femaleatlhawk @ATLHawks Don’t understand what’s so difficult to understand. 🤣😂🤣 it’s better that they just say they don’t like the coach. Instead you giving the players a free pass again. Makes no sense@RCWilliams88 @femaleatlhawk @ATLHawks How did it look against Memphis. Wanna know what happened there? I’m tell you, our defense created 12 steals, 7 blks. That resulted in 24 points. Defense creates offense my friend. Hate to break it to you. But it’s a fact@ATLHawks @Verizon Knicks, our regular customers...@femaleatlhawk @ushervincent893 @ATLHawks When the only strategy is playing hard defensively and hustling for 48 mins and not just a quarter here or there. You’re exactly right because this team does not play hard on defense consistently. Even in basic man to man. It’s embarrassing to see@Stillncrj1 @femaleatlhawk @ATLHawks Absolutely!

Really bothers me it really does. Man to man defense to be successful takes communication and hustle(rotations etc). The strategy is fine the execution is not@femaleatlhawk @Stillncrj1 @ATLHawks Because a coach can coach a player all day and it’s up to the players to execute what he’s coaching them.@ATLHawks are in front at the half, 64-58 🍿 https://t.co/FECAgkOCF3@aussie_beerguy @ATLHawks @RexChapman Are you dense?

He needs to stop that. Knicks are doing a lot right during this 1st Quarter.

Force Toppin to make those. Dare him! Obi Toppin shoots less than 25% from 3 in ’21.
