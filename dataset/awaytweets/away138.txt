It looks like this offseason was build with beating the Champs. I Think Marks looked at the Bucks series, where Blake was so effective staying on Giannis and Brown on Middleton@Alec_Sturm @TimCapstraw @BrooklynNets @GregLogan1 @BKNetsRadio I think pnr coverage is about all of your personnel and especially your bigs. Jeff Green needed to switch, same with Claxton. New additions like Bembry, Carter, Millsap and Mills all make much more sense out of a switching scheme@MRubie91 @HowieRose Perhaps, but Nets have biggest names, they ever abandon Brooklyn branding and market as Manhattan and win a title, 1/2 fans in city jump to them.

I enjoy these a lot.@JHarden13 @KDTrey5 @BrooklynNets The same guy who wouldn’t run down a loose ball which resulted in a dunk@TimCapstraw @BrooklynNets @GregLogan1 @BKNetsRadio Last year, Nets would switch often to accommodate Harden’s defensive style. But he’s been disappointing as a perimeter defense, so switching to a drop scheme has helped unlock Harris, Brown, and Bembry.@TimCapstraw @BrooklynNets Yes!!! Excellent breakdown. Blake is better utilized in the drop coverage. Nets are going places using Griffin this way 👍🏽👍🏽@fin1fan @LouRicciardi @BrooklynNets @BKNetsRadio Close, I put the commercial at the end of video.@max_adjei1 @TheLakersReview Big name appeal so the Lakers could copy that Brooklyn Nets Big-3 strictly on paper, publicity stunt.

Is this a sign?@JHarden13 @KDTrey5 @BrooklynNets Boys locked in@BrooklynNets @blakegriffin23 Gotta give it to Blake, he plays hard every night even if he isn’t scoringJust saw a Brooklyn Net out and about. He walked right past me 👀👀Man Brooklyn oh Brooklyn @NetsGamingCrew and @BrooklynNets really down bad lately. Both lose their top tier in league PGs to covid related issues (vaccine refusal and fake vaccine card) Can't even make this up. Tough Ls. Keep your heads up y'all https://t.co/pdBBS2TDxu@BADGEPLUG @NBA2K @MELOD1P @KarlTowns @BrooklynNets @memgrizz @Timberwolves I played a whole season of My Career. Played playoffs and won champion. But did not receive the Gym Rat badge. Robbed me of my time and money I put into my build. #2kMustDoBetter@BrooklynNets Scary hourswhat happened to the Brooklyn Nets the lakers Miami Heat?? https://t.co/5Wk29yHPnv@JHarden13 @KDTrey5 @BrooklynNets I need 30 points from you without that many fouls@GoatedAJK @BrooklynNets Doesn't want to take a vaccine because others are losing their jobs for making same choice, not because he is anti-vax. It was after he said this that made me stop supporting his decision. I thought he was anti-vax, which is reasonable than what he said@brooklynsbeat I keep telling you this @KyrieIrving was made complicated by @joetsai1999. Kyrie might have taken the vaccine if he was playing on the road and seeing how this teammates needed him for home games. It’s a win for him and lost for the @BrooklynNets@BrooklynNets @SociosHoops @Joe_Makar in the cut@GoatedAJK @BrooklynNets Well the City won't allow it. He was the reason KD came to Brooklyn but now the guy who has been a fan of the franchise since his childhood is rather not willing to conform to the City laws because people are losing their jobs for making a choice.@Sage1354 @MFreeman_ATASED @PAHippieChick @hodgetwins @AaronRodgers12 @BrooklynNets He was asked if he was vaccinated and replied, "yes, I've been immunized". He say "yes" and a vaccine is a immunization. He was lying; so, just stop pretending he didn't lie (nothing will happen to him, it's just a PR thing)Raptors star Siakam returning ahead of schedule Sunday vs. Brooklyn Nets https://t.co/31yTMK2NFI@BrooklynNets @SociosHoops Dude wearing VC number thats a og right there@JHarden13 @KDTrey5 @BrooklynNets A Rottweiler and A Doberman!!!The @BrooklynNets &amp; @Lakers have had the MOST BLOOPERS SO FAR THIS YR https://t.co/5KGF8N6SWINJ Voters are having their votes and their election stolen.

Let a man practice his right to not get vaccinated@JHarden13 @KDTrey5 @BrooklynNets This a good picThe nets trading Irving for Simmons, not sure about this….I’m already getting a headache. #NBA75 #NBA #BenSimmons #kyrie #BrooklynNets@hhgcffff4 @PabloMcQueen2 @_Talkin_NBA @JHarden13 @KDTrey5 @BrooklynNets Fax but harden is gonna average an efficient 23 and 13 if they start calling more fouls while he’s driving but if they don’t I can see him putting up 18 &amp; 12@JHarden13 @KDTrey5 @BrooklynNets That’s a hard pic🔥 Reminds me of how dope this is

https://t.co/RuU7K4iDNs@PabloMcQueen2 @JJHeavvy @_Talkin_NBA @JHarden13 @KDTrey5 @BrooklynNets Barley 10 games into the season bro gotta chill with the rule changes dame under 30% for 3pt no ones saying it’s cause of the new rules players still getting in condition harden a play better they still 6-3 💯@lil_Kyrios @BrooklynNets You can’t demonize someone for having freedom, he was willing to wear masks and test everyday as well to prevent any incidents which is perfectly fine in my books.You don’t get it. If this girl was a sports team she’d be the 2018-19 Brooklyn nets.Siakam, who last played an NBA game on May 8, will play Sunday afternoon when the Raptors host the Brooklyn Nets at the Scotiabank Arena. https://t.co/FkeGYSBxwN@JHarden13 @KDTrey5 @BrooklynNets The dogs bollocks .... as they here in the UK 🔥🔥🔥@ZaheerWorldwide @okcfanrylee @BleacherReport @BrooklynNets u made that list and didn’t even put mobley on it@BrooklynNets @blakegriffin23 😅 this man is so adorable lol@PabloMcQueen2 @hhgcffff4 @_Talkin_NBA @JHarden13 @KDTrey5 @BrooklynNets He’s NOT trying 2 lead the nba in scoring he’s trying 2 lead the league in assist &amp; he’s still getting hit while he’s driving they’re just not calling it &amp; it’s not apart of the new rule they’re cheating 2 make the games closers for more money💯 that’s why his scoring his down rn@JJHeavvy @hhgcffff4 @_Talkin_NBA @JHarden13 @KDTrey5 @BrooklynNets When did I say he’s not a superstar? I just said he’s not playing like one. And since the season started and the foul rules were changed, he’s not putting up points the way he used to. Where’s the lie? Maybe once he’s comfortable again he’ll be back to scoring. But rn? Nah.@YDvbbz @YuldyXD @JHarden13 @KDTrey5 @BrooklynNets Sarcasm kid relax.@NBA2K @MELOD1P @KarlTowns @BrooklynNets @memgrizz @Timberwolves Melo,Kay,ja should be 93 overalls@MdG312 @NBA2K @MELOD1P @KarlTowns @BrooklynNets @memgrizz @Timberwolves They have to please the bandwagon boys@biasfactscry @nb_rich @NBA2K @MELOD1P @KarlTowns @BrooklynNets @memgrizz @Timberwolves Harden already told KD that he feels fine. KD said he just have to get back right. Don’t use that injury as an excuse.@Samplaysdrums_ @CameronDerouen @NBA2K @MELOD1P @KarlTowns @BrooklynNets @memgrizz @Timberwolves That play was created by the coach. If he immediately runs for a double team, somebody was suppose to cover for him. If you played basketball before you should know this.@hhgcffff4 @_Talkin_NBA @JHarden13 @KDTrey5 @BrooklynNets Because it speaks to his overall game rn. Without those ticky tack foul calls he’s not the same player. People are just making observations, that’s part of being a pro athlete.@okcfanrylee @BleacherReport @BrooklynNets Cam Thomas, Chris Duarte, Scottie Barnes, Josh giddy, Davion Mitchell, Brandon Boston clear of him🌚@NBA2K @MELOD1P @KarlTowns @BrooklynNets @memgrizz @Timberwolves Why is lamelo sucked so much when anthon Edward is having almost as good of as season as him.@YuldyXD @JHarden13 @KDTrey5 @BrooklynNets Left it all on the floor@PabloMcQueen2 @_Talkin_NBA @JHarden13 @KDTrey5 @BrooklynNets No if they lost it would be a problem they won so why make a big deal ?@BrooklynNets @blakegriffin23 See..Blake actually played real solid! Now...if he can give the Nets an average of 14 pts 8 or 9rbs a game! Thats all they would need him from him@BrooklynNets @dayron_sharpe play him more@BullsGotNext @NBA2K @MELOD1P @KarlTowns @BrooklynNets @memgrizz @Timberwolves And you wonder why his overall dropped https://t.co/C2zd5UNWvg@lead2324 @nbatopshot @KDTrey5 @BrooklynNets Thanks
