Was a very fun team@j_o_neill @demeatloaf @soapstarjo @Mark25Price @RMFieldHouse @cavs Oh 100% on the jam@wear_athletic @cavs @sexton @bakermayfield Yep and playing vs those defenses in that weather@hiramboyd @cavs @sexton @bakermayfield The weather going to destroy him like all of our previous QB's except for a few...opponents know this...@wear_athletic @cavs @sexton @bakermayfield 5. Same System 

It's a gross overpay because they screwed up 

I've lost all hope for this franchise and the current leadership 
.I wont root against them but cant support them any longer@XDrewsipherX @demeatloaf @soapstarjo @Mark25Price @RMFieldHouse @cavs I'm not much older than you (86), and most of my price memories were from listening to Joe Tait when we went to our local schools open (to certain people who knew the custodian lol) gym. Great  memories. Also price was money in nba jam with corner 3s and steals.@wear_athletic @cavs @sexton @bakermayfield Watson is a good player for sure .  As a pure passer I'd take a healthy Baker .  Watson is clearly the better runner 

Watson had clear advantages 

1..3/4 of games in dome/great weather 

2. Health

3. Inherited a playoff team 

4 . Not playing Steelers, RavensThe team had a clear plan of care. Then they executed and communicated it with compassion. They considered all possibilities. They patiently answered all my questions and attended to my every need. I even had the rare opportunity to watch the @cavs on TV (in a loss to LBJ 😔). 6/@ChiefWahoo22 @cavs @kenbou5950 @miggy_roman @CamoAkaRambo @Catoishere @Cmd_Guap1 @iamkrang @FadedCollects @Shakabrodie @creamm1987 @ElShaungo_ @OspreysFB @Slimdog @chiguy2420 @RamseesTheGreat 🔥🔥🔥 amazing, I think we need some chrome domes now with all of the Cavs colors, would be a great pack@LJFamFoundation @KingJames @cavs @Lakers Awesome!!!!@GabeWasylko @CityofCleveland @DowntownCLE @cavs @TowerLightsCLE @JACKCleCasino Nice picture. Too bad we’re a dying city.@hiramboyd @cavs @sexton @bakermayfield So I have a question for you: What do they see in Watson that I dont see...and many astute fans see the same thing..except for our fickled fan base..?@ChiefWahoo22 @cavs @kenbou5950 @miggy_roman @CamoAkaRambo @Catoishere @Cmd_Guap1 @iamkrang @FadedCollects @Shakabrodie @creamm1987 @jdtheghost_1 @ElShaungo_ @OspreysFB @Slimdog @RamseesTheGreat Ohh ok!
