Combine the Heat‚Äôs available players and the Celtics‚Äô defensive plan, and you see them being forced into something that‚Äôs not them

They‚Äôre not shooting well, but you can‚Äôt drive and kick if there‚Äôs no one to drivejust got out the shower &amp; that‚Äôs how ya going out ? @MiamiHEAT üÜóWhen does Spo pull the plug on this game and rest his starters for tomorrow's game in Toronto? #MiamiHeatI think we all gave a free pass to the bubble contenders.

Miami allowed 40 third-quarter points.

Not their night.Keep this mf Duncan in for the whole 4th since all he wants to do is get his cardio in @MiamiHEATI saved up for 2 whole years in order to go to this game, and THIS is the product that I get?

#LEGENDoftheMiamiHEAT #NBA75The Miami Heat should be called the Miami School Lockdown Drills with how many white shooters they have send tweetThe Celtics are 2-of-8 from the free throw line. That, combined with losing Miami shooters, has gotten the Heat right back in this game.

Boston has 5 points in 5:26 of the second quarter.Tie game! We back baby! WE GOT SHOOTERS! @MiamiHEAT#MIAvsBOS 

Celtics 2/7 free throws

#LEGENDoftheMiamiHEAT #NBA75I just made explained an astrology prediction to my senile aunt and she genuinely understood/listened to it, which was nice BUT there is a basketball game rn and we both collectively think that the Celtics will lose to Miami heat (without looking at miami's chart tho üò¨)@MiamiHEAT Keep it up@Devy210 Miami Heat basketball is on@I_Man_12 @MiamiHEAT @betwayusa Agreed@strick9si @MiamiHEAT @betwayusa keep on telling yourself that.

#MIAvsBOSThe heat really just created their own 2K player during COVID and didn‚Äôt even bother to name him . @MiamiHEATYou can tell when Duncan Robinson is having a bad game. His shot is SO flat it never has a chance. When he's shooting well he has a great high release and arc. Needs some half-time reps.

#BleedGreenHerro gonna drop 41pts tonight. @5ReasonsSports @tropicalblanket @GregSylvander #MiamiHeatPretty good first possession by the Celtics against Miami's zone. Patient, worked it to the middle, found Jaylen Brown from there and he hit Robert Williams with the lob. The Heat will probably play a lot of zone. They do it anyway, and it's been one way to slow down the Celtics.#MIAvsBOS
