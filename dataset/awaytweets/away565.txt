#RipCity | #NBA | @jackdoc13  https://t.co/T4Rkvrdlwh@Reese929IndAtl @GSATLFan @MikeBellATL @JohnFricke @Bighugh53 @ATLHawks That was his original deal and the Hawks on September 1st gave him a 2 year extension. Which means he is here through 2025. They include the YEARS REMAINING ON THE CURRENT CONTRACT. So that means 2 yr ext.put him at 4 years. He won't be trade eligible until March 1st.@femaleatlhawk @ATLHawks They are too nice and there isn't any integrity in the game. It's hard to coach or play the right way against that. Atlanta needs a Ron Artest, a player who doesn't care about the score, they care about the little things and will literally fight for those little things. https://t.co/c1RfGp7ZjX@Reese929IndAtl @GSATLFan @MikeBellATL @JohnFricke @Bighugh53 @ATLHawks Remember Clint had 2 years left on his original deal so that is included with the extension.  HE SIGNED that deal on September 1st which means he couldn't be traded until March 1st which is after trade deadline.Trae Young recorded the most assists (14) in a game with at least 55 points (he had 56) in NBA history on Monday, but it still wasn't enough for the slumping Atlanta Hawks to win.

It's on tape &amp; nothing happens. Larry Brown as an assistant, defense. Energy, we never have it, let JJ &amp; Coop get 20 min. What u got to lose?@Ersatz_Attorney @MikeBellATL @JohnFricke @Bighugh53 @ATLHawks This is the issueAtlanta Hawks are expected to be active at the trade deadline, per Travis SchlenkTake the top teams in the league, replace all the players with 10 day contracts for a month and see how long they keep it together with only their best player by themselves. Then ask if they should be an allstar or not. Acknowledge that happened to the @ATLHawks.@ATLHawks @emoryhealthcare PLAY DEFENSE TOMORROW@makaqukulani @ATLHawks @jcollins20_ ?????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????? trae young is literally the leader of the team. it's legit a good thing that jc plays around him wtf.@startingvbasket @ChampionAstr0 @ATLHawks @TheTraeYoung We don‚Äôt care about the ‚Äúlist‚Äù we want to start winning and have a shot in the playoffs.@ATLHawks @TheTraeYoung We need another tenured leader on the team to help us win. Having @mrvincecarter15 on the team was such a blessing. We miss you Vince!@nonbiascurryfan @precisism @thenecklaced0n @DamesMVPszn @statmuse @TheTraeYoung @ATLHawks Uh no but go crazy. Tell me wilts game score.Atlanta Hawks gonna miss the playoffsLast night in Portland, the Trail Blazers hosted the Atlanta Hawks, and when the dust settled, Portland escaped with a 136-131 victory thanks to a similarly dominating outing from a lesser-known guard.
