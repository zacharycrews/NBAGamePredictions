I got blocked, I thought it was just a fun conversation🤭🤯@AnthTheKnee @DetroitPistons @DraftKings @hamidoudiallo You don’t think upper management could tell Case to get Hami more minutes and Frank less if that was the case? Weaver brought back Frank and CoJo and signed Trey to even make this a debate in blocking the young fellas…@FreedumFyghter @DetroitPistons @DraftKings @hamidoudiallo Not management the terrible coach named Dwayne Casey that got fired as leading a team to the finals isn’t very smart. Troy is the reason they signed hami because of how good he is. “Coach’s decision” is the reason he didn’t play. Casey is gone soon@AnthTheKnee @DetroitPistons @DraftKings @hamidoudiallo And Pistons management I guess 😬 Damn, would you be more upset if I said CoJo and Lyles should get minutes over LightSaben and 
Gar-Zilla? Like I hit a nerve on Hami…@FreedumFyghter @DetroitPistons @DraftKings @hamidoudiallo If you wanna be the 1 guy who thinks that out of every Detroit fan in Michigan then sure lol@AnthTheKnee @DetroitPistons @DraftKings @hamidoudiallo Ok Kewl. I don’t think any team would play Hami over Frank so🤷🏼‍♂️ I guess agree to disagree. Maybe we should hit up a game to talk it out😂😂😂The Detroit Lions so ass the Detroit Pistons ass can we just start overTonight the Brooklyn Nets (3-3) host the Detroit Pistons (1-4) at 7:30 🕢 @YESNetwork #Brooklyn #Nets #NBA #BrooklynTogetherAt Least My Dawg @CadeCunningham_ Ain’t Let Me Down In His @DetroitPistons Season Debut Last Night Being A Playmaker In That Win vs. Orlando!

Even if he’s only on the team for being Jerami’s BFF, sometimes gotta keep your best player happy🤷🏼‍♂️ I don’t know if the expectations preseason could reason firing Case…Had the pleasure of taking @Walterejones and #BlakeFoster to their first #Pistons game. Big thanks to the @detroitpistons for the tickets and on-court experience! 🤟🏾🏀 #DetroitBasketball #AaronConey #WalterJones #PowerRangers #HustleMatters https://t.co/aa46iT88tO@freepsports @DetroitPistons Why Not?@AnthTheKnee @DetroitPistons @DraftKings @hamidoudiallo I haven’t brought Cade up, he’s not in the discussion for the bench. I’m saying the bench should be
LightSaben
Frank
JJ
Kelly O
Garz-illa 
Hami would be an eleven man to add intense athleticism while the other team is tired…I’m giving him his flowers while we still got him. Let’s appreciate the legend George Blaha! @DetroitPistons @JohnnyKaneTV #GOAT #detroit #pistons https://t.co/5eJhw0B68uNo Cade Cunningham tonight. The @DetroitPistons are taking it easy with the 2021 No. 1 overall pick. https://t.co/FuFLZPSV5q@FreedumFyghter @DetroitPistons @DraftKings @hamidoudiallo Frank is a role player at best. Hami is literally a 10x better player than Frank is and will ever be. Not playing hami over them is what’s going to get Casey fired@FreedumFyghter @DetroitPistons @DraftKings @hamidoudiallo Last year was completely irrelevant. Last year was supposed to just be a development year for the rookies. Frank Jackson has been in the league long enough and is only on the team because he’s grants friend. You’re nuts if you think Frank would ever take away from Cade lol@AnthTheKnee @DetroitPistons @DraftKings @hamidoudiallo Hami is a better athlete but Frank got the team back in games last year that made sports radio worried that he would cost us Cade. I wouldn’t be pissed if Frank wasn’t brought back but he did earn it after last year… Trey and CoJo haven’t played bad but it’s not good timing…@FreedumFyghter @DetroitPistons @DraftKings @hamidoudiallo Hami is 10x better than Frank Jackson. Saben, hami, josh Jackson Kelly O and Garza need to be the bench.Cade sitting on the b2b, Killian looking like junior varsity… deep sigh @DetroitPistonsPSA: Reminder to everyone that basketball players should play basketball. #DetroitBasketball #detroitpistons #basketball @CadeCunningham_ @DetroitPistons #DetroitUp #Pistons@AnthTheKnee @DetroitPistons @DraftKings @hamidoudiallo I’m ok w/ Frank resigning but the CoJo and Lyles pickups stalling LightSaben and Garza’s development feels like a massive mistake. Hami unfortunately was always likely gonna be a 3rd string type. Maybe send them to the G-League if they’re not getting min but they don’t have 2way?Jalen Green will be better long term than Cade Cunningham 💯🤷🏽‍♂️👍🏽 also I haven’t seen Cade play but just a feeling @DetroitPistons @HoustonRockets@DetroitPistons @DraftKings @hamidoudiallo Now give him some real minutes smh@DetroitPistons @DraftKings @hamidoudiallo Cade out tonight with rest 😳😥@DetroitPistons @DraftKings @hamidoudiallo I wish he played@DetroitPistons @DraftKings @hamidoudiallo Imagine playing Frank Jackson and Corey Joseph over hami and saben lee smh@DetroitPistons @DraftKings @hamidoudiallo Tired of Casey not playing him.

(How did I do @WorldofIsaac ?)First win of the season! @DetroitPistons 

Cade with a modest debut, especially shooting just 1 for 8, but he undoubtedly made a difference to the overall spacing and offense.
