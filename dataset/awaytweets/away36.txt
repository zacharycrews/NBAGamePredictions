It's literally the same process of broad guesses on a bunch of unproven raw youth + erratic lottery luck (w/more difficult odds now).

You don't know the future so you do not know its superior.  

It is the same 💩 strategy.#NBA #NBATwitter Today's Lineups

Fultz, JI and WCJ are all on extensions to begin this process.@MalikG @dlr662 @theozonepod @Magic_PR @OrlandoMagic @EliasSports @NBAHistory @NBA The only difference with Hennigan's extensions and Weltman's is that Hennigan re-signed healthy players. 

Weltman has extended 3 players who have been injured majority of their careers...two with MAJOR injury concerns that will remain moving forward.@zerojuantwo3 @dlr662 @theozonepod @Magic_PR @OrlandoMagic @EliasSports @NBAHistory @NBA Gotcha - how the team will look if and when it gets to contention is an entirely different doscussion.

I'm thankful for now to at least see a different process (and one which to my eye is superior).@UNC_Basketball @The_ColeAnthony @OrlandoMagic Go HEELS!@OrlandoMagic @BenJones3000 revenge time 😈@McNuttMonica @nyknicks @OrlandoMagic @MSGNetworks Love those shoes https://t.co/CtdDAdIhSu@MalikG @dlr662 @theozonepod @Magic_PR @OrlandoMagic @EliasSports @NBAHistory @NBA Nah...Fultz &amp; JI were on rookie scale last season, just like Vuc, Harris, Fournier and AG were...WCJr is literally still on rookie scale.

Look at "the process" only players there are Embiid + Simmons (for now), rest gone.  

That's how rebuilds &amp; really the NBA works - vast majority of players only last on a team 1-4 yearsHere’s the starting five for the Orlando Magic tonight against the #Knicks https://t.co/z4UMhefXQl@OrlandoMagic @The_ColeAnthony Are those new shorts 👀It's time for a re-match in the Big Apple!

Also, in this rebuild, the players who have been extended are in place alongside the young talent brought in the last 2 years. 

Who was in place similarly FOR Evan, AG, Vooch &amp; Harris?@iRacer77 @OrlandoMagic @The_ColeAnthony Yeah hopefully he will. He showed some great flashes last year so hopefully he can regain some of that tonight and have a great game!NBA 🏀

West, Sacramento kingshonestly we should just disband the city of Orlando after the Knicks shame the Magic into oblivion tonight@Magic_PR @OrlandoMagic @EliasSports @NBAHistory @NBA It's mind boggling that Magic PR is trying to trick casual fans with "youngest team" nonsense, as if that was a good thing in the NBA. 

The only time being "youngest team" is a good thing is when it's got "in the playoffs" behind it.Miami plays Orlando on a back-to-back tomorrow night in Miami at 7:30 pm EST. 

The Magic (0-2) are playing the Knicks (2-0) tonight in MSG. 

Miami’s record SHOULD be 2-1 after tomorrow’s game….@Magic_PR @OrlandoMagic @EliasSports @NBAHistory @NBA Too much youth creates the worst possible context for player development.

Oladipo described Hennigan's failed rebuild as one with too much youth creating a "rat's on a ladder in a sinking ship" dynamic.

Working  my way to the Chicago Bulls.@J_breeezzzyy I mean I get it he’s got the numbers career wise but he only played for the magic for 8 years and he barely played his last season in Orlando cus of surgery, he’s top 100 for sure but he only had a handful of elite years@TerrenceRoss @OrlandoMagic As a magic fan, i didnt see a problem with the tweet@ClarenceDayPSU @OrlandoMagic Ridiculous take. So if someone scored 50 in a blowout loss that wouldn't count for anything? Or set an NBA record for something? If CP3 reached 20k points and 10k assists but lost to the Lakers by 20 it's not allowed to be discussed?@bones24jr @OrlandoMagic How miserable of a person are you? 

You take positives from losses. Bamba had a decent and efficient game, and given he's had a rough start to his career, it's something worth noting. Or do you just not count stats from games lost by over a certain number?Orlando Magic most win in New York not easy thing to do but we cant drop another game 😰🥶@TerrenceRoss @OrlandoMagic Nah…. it’s the truth@PriviteraLouis They’ll make a difference. Doesn’t make Orlando a playoff team, but they won’t be losing by 30 every night, which is the biggest problem right now. The Magic aren’t even competing. They should at least compete, with the hope of getting better eventually. Otherwise, abort mission.@OrlandoMagic @RjHampton14 Man we posting preseason highlights now……☠️HERE'S WHAT'S NEXT
