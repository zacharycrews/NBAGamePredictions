https://t.co/f0j3OP0Sjrthe detroit pistons are so underrated they have a great young cast with people like cade cunningham i have a feeling that they will make some big trades at the deadline and have some playoff successCade Cunningham and Franz Wagner are giving the Eastern Conference‚Äôs bottom two teams reasons for optimism.
The Detroit Pistons and Orlando Magic have seven victories apiece this season, but they also have two of the NBA‚Äôs top rookies.  # # # # # #

https://t.co/uyj8YSKTBo https://t.co/xvpDaCZLdt@ObiFloppin @iAmZBag1 @Pistons__Talk Did they even say why Detroit does this over any other option? It‚Äôs so one sided that it‚Äôs odd they continue to push it@CaseyHilts1 @Pistons__Talk I wouldn‚Äôt want Detroit to pay Sexton a bag even though he‚Äôs a really good shooter. Personally I see him as an elite 6th man scorer to limit his flaws

My ideal trade is Zaire Williams, Kyle Anderson, and Brandon Clarke. If we can‚Äôt get Clarke then Tille or Tillman &amp; a 1stThe Bucks are coming off a 115-106 loss to the Detroit Pistons, who earned back-to-back wins for the first time this season. https://t.co/HyY3J6T5IdMini Milestone üèÄ
