https://t.co/f0j3OP0Sjrthe detroit pistons are so underrated they have a great young cast with people like cade cunningham i have a feeling that they will make some big trades at the deadline and have some playoff successCade Cunningham and Franz Wagner are giving the Eastern Conference’s bottom two teams reasons for optimism.
The Detroit Pistons and Orlando Magic have seven victories apiece this season, but they also have two of the NBA’s top rookies.  # # # # # #

https://t.co/uyj8YSKTBo https://t.co/xvpDaCZLdt@ObiFloppin @iAmZBag1 @Pistons__Talk Did they even say why Detroit does this over any other option? It’s so one sided that it’s odd they continue to push it@CaseyHilts1 @Pistons__Talk I wouldn’t want Detroit to pay Sexton a bag even though he’s a really good shooter. Personally I see him as an elite 6th man scorer to limit his flaws
