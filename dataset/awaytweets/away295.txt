The Orlando Magic for example are a fun young team, who don’t know how to close games. Their record is bad, but are competitive.Will The losing streak come to an end Tonight?

Funny thing at the Orlando game, several of us chanted Ayo in the 4th qtr, the Magic fan said who the hell is that, then you scored 8 pts quickly, told the guy you gone learn today.Nikola Vučević returned to Orlando with a splash, helping the Bulls against his former team in a 123-88 victory against the Magic.

https://t.co/4tqFSilhNK@ESPNNBA I think the biggest compliment you can give to Dwight is that he made the Orlando fucking magic relevant. Look where Orlando has been since he left@softwareSwat @OrlandoMagic Looks like we get another lottery pick this season. So we’ll add more young talent.

A fit Fultz and Isaac completely changes this team, so I’m optimistic@softwareSwat @OrlandoMagic I believe he will be as good as some of those@MagicBamba @OrlandoMagic Yep, he is improved, you reckon he's going to be a franchise center? Just to be clear we're bottom of the league and I'm talking becoming a TOP player. Not a decent player.

Look how bad Anthony Edwards was in his first season to now. Mosely is a young coach who is also learning@Flexington87 @cigamodnalro Yeah I’d have to imagine if he looked back on it he wouldn’t have done what he did in regards to leaving Orlando. It’s a shame really because he would of gone down easily as the best Magic player ever and probably still is to some degree despite only 8 seasons.@softwareSwat @OrlandoMagic It’s not that bad mate.
