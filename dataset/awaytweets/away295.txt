The Orlando Magic for example are a fun young team, who don‚Äôt know how to close games. Their record is bad, but are competitive.Will The losing streak come to an end Tonight?

Orlando Magic Under 203@OrlandoMagic @CCDistillery @wendellcarter34 Great to see Wendell playing like this hopefully he just continues to play like thisPatrick Beverley has missed 3 games this season, 2 from an injury. The #Timberwolves have played flat in both of those games.
- Orlando Magic: 115-97
-Charlotte Hornets: 133-115

Beverley's impact on this team cannot be overstatedIt‚Äôs so hard to be a @OrlandoMagic fan now days. I‚Äôm really getting tired of being at the bottom and getting our team changed heavily every other year.

A fit Fultz and Isaac completely changes this team, so I‚Äôm optimistic@softwareSwat @OrlandoMagic I believe he will be as good as some of those@MagicBamba @OrlandoMagic Yep, he is improved, you reckon he's going to be a franchise center?
