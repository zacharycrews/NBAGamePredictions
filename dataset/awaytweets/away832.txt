I think in Cleveland, we‚Äôre just happy to getting past the post Lebron haze.@cavs @KingJames let's see non-stop alley oops from Garland to James this all star game!@mikelsenior @cavs @KingJames Man.. LeBron haters really are the most insufferable people.. ‚Äúfalse king‚Äù üòÇü§° If he wanted to come back in free agency, I‚Äôd welcome him with open arms.

I think they‚Äôve got a great foundation to do so

LeVert is going to be a huge asset and help give DG rest of needed with his back@GabeWasylko @NBAAllStar @TowerLightsCLE @Nike @NBA @KingJames @KDTrey5 @CityofCleveland @DowntownCLE How in the world does Cleveland not put one of their own up there? @cavs @cavsdan @TheRealTRizzo@NJKujawa3 @Matt48401756 @untouchable_06 @JoohnSn @cavs @KingJames It's time to build a legacy without Bron. Cedi himself said this today. Move on.@LenPeralta @cavs They could make some noise in the playoffs but eventually, they're going to need a star, whether it's homegrown like Garland or they execute a trade or something.@hallublin What I really love about this current @cavs team is there isn‚Äôt that dominant Lebron-esque player. It‚Äôs a bunch of unknowns who are doing some amazing things. Excited for the future of this franchise.@Matt48401756 @untouchable_06 @JoohnSn @mikelsenior @cavs @KingJames Imagine LBJ being able to play 20-25min a game as he‚Äôs nearing the end of his career? He would be incredibly healthy and rested come playoff time. 

I doubt he would take that, but I know he doesn‚Äôt want to play 38-40min a game at 37yrs oldHey @cavs fans, has anyone photoshopped the Ken Ganley KIA lady onto the Sherwin Williams billboard yet?@cavs @KingJames Everyone wants DG the PG https://t.co/ug7J9ryFtt@JSayHey @cavs @KingJames He‚Äôs not going anywhere. Lebron left cause we couldn‚Äôt surround him with talent. Now we don‚Äôt just have talent but it‚Äôs young talent. Mobely has potential to be one of the best players in the league DG ain‚Äôt walking away from that"If you want to say something nice about me you can right here." ü§£

SOUND ON for @CediOsman mic'd up during last night's @cavs win

Never put your star player on a date that‚Äôs the same (or after) as the trade deadline. From the Book of Berris.@Dom_2k I think you meant Cleveland CavaliersAll this just to stop the @cavs

Pretty sure he wouldn't be looking to trade anyone, just make them better.@mikelsenior @cavs @KingJames ‚ÄúOld ass‚Äù LeBron is scoring 29 points per game.
