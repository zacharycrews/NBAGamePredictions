#NBA #sport #ml #forexDarius Garland should not play in the all-star game if he has some major back issues. @cavs@CavsTheTweets This was predictable. There was no way @dariusgarland22 was gonna play a back to back, especially with 3 days off then the break. And if he sits tonight he gets 2 days since last game. This is a good move by the @cavs."I was just happy to be able to play with him again, happy to be able to grow our basketball careers together again. It was a happy moment."

I want the GOAT back on my team for@cavs @TowerCityCLE @NBA Ahmaad for the 3pt contest ???@TheBubbaD I just wanna see the @cavs have success w/o LeBron help and I prefer him to not control the roster and bring in his buddies. We did that and it didn’t work 10 of the 11 years. He is not good at building a roster. I like this current roster too much to see it ruined.My biggest hope for the @cavs is that what we’re building is long-term, stable and looks something this: https://t.co/2H68cQLsZNSink four shots in under 60 seconds for a chance to win #NBAAllStar event tickets and merch this weekend at @TowerCityCLE! 🏀🌟

We’re gonna lock down Garland long term, and we already have Allen long term plus Sexton for atleast one more season. This would be great for them, as well as a chance for another ring@NBA2K @MONSTATREZZ @CarisLeVert @Dsabonis11 @PelicansNBA @cavs @SacramentoKings And by the way all my save and data were “CORRUPTED” last night.

SMH!@sweet @cavs Good@JoeButtari42 @cavs @dariusgarland22 @KingJames @NBAAllStar How would he ruin our chemistry? Lebron is a well liked teammate from nearly every person he’s played with, not to mention he’s still averaging 29,7,6 on 52% shooting and we owe a lot to him for bringing our franchise to relevance. The goal is a championship every season.@NBA2K @MONSTATREZZ @CarisLeVert @Dsabonis11 @PelicansNBA @cavs @SacramentoKings I just hope when you say “new faces” this includes new face scan for other players.. Mac mcclung even got his own face scan who barely play in the league and you can’t give austin reeves his? Where are the new shoes? Update player shoe brands they are WAY OUT DATED!@Raptors 🤝 @cavs 
Getting no media attention whatsoever@TicoisTocory @cavs Gonna love thatThis is a great point. There was always pressure when Lebron was in Cleveland to put the best roster together or he was leaving! There was always talk about do this and do that or he’s gone. The table has turned LA! Cleveland is the place to be again! The Cleveland Cavaliers! https://t.co/pLmds44Iho https://t.co/TH1z2oLLGF@king_ofdior @cavs @dariusgarland22 @KingJames @NBAAllStar IMO he would ruin our chemistry. We have a young, hardworking team that is all together. Lebron brings that presence that changes all of that. I’m grateful for his efforts here all those years but I’m ready to move on. He wouldn’t think of coming home if we were garbage still.…. that’s better 😉 #LetEmKnow #Cleveland #Cavaliers #NBAAllStar @dariusgarland22 https://t.co/RMOu0oy3uj@NBA2K @MONSTATREZZ @CarisLeVert @Dsabonis11 @PelicansNBA @cavs @SacramentoKings Wasn't Levert playing for the Cavs before the deadline?

He would be incredibly healthy and rested come playoff time. 

I doubt he would take that, but I know he doesn’t want to play 38-40min a game at 37yrs oldHey @cavs fans, has anyone photoshopped the Ken Ganley KIA lady onto the Sherwin Williams billboard yet?@cavs @KingJames Everyone wants DG the PG https://t.co/ug7J9ryFtt@JSayHey @cavs @KingJames He’s not going anywhere. Lebron left cause we couldn’t surround him with talent. Now we don’t just have talent but it’s young talent.

Pretty sure he wouldn't be looking to trade anyone, just make them better.@mikelsenior @cavs @KingJames “Old ass” LeBron is scoring 29 points per game. Imagine if he were on this team with these young guys.@jeskeets @Cavs are winners. Added a big time scoring wing that can get his own. For practically nothing.

Snoop dogg just bought death row records....so can we get fucking real?@JoohnSn @mikelsenior @cavs @KingJames Facts and the way the east is getting so strong, it def cannot hurt to add Lebron to a good cavs team. Just saying. The east is legit tougher after today. Don't tell me he can't be useful 😁Everyone on @NBAonTNT just wrote off the @cavs I hope @dariusgarland22 was watchingCan't wait for @cavs annihilate Harden and the @sixersI love that the sports commenters aren’t even mentioning the #Cavs to win the East. We will shock the world, WATCH! To my @cavs, keep grinding and working!! Oh and definitely continue to have tons of FUN!@CLETommy @TheClevelandEra @cavs @KingJames Bron will.@cavs @dariusgarland22 @KingJames @NBAAllStar oh gosh it's homecoming@cavs @KingJames And so it begins…. Can the Cavs restrict Darius Garland from playing on an Olympic team or keep him in a plastic bubble? He’s gonna need body guards to protect him from other stars trying to take his talents to another Mega Team.@cavs @dariusgarland22 @KingJames @NBAAllStar Represent!  Proud of my hometown Cavaliers!  The sun only shines an average of 66 days in Cleveland!  May the sun shine for this event🙏🏾@mikelsenior @cavs @KingJames He got LA a ring his second year, a ring that young core would never get. Just like he did for the Cavs. What you said doesn't even makes sense. It's just hating. Have some respect for what he did for the Cavs and don't be a buffoon.@okudah_szn @cavs @dariusgarland22 @KingJames @NBAAllStar We’ll get better jerseys for his next all star appearance hopefully 💀@cavs @KingJames There is no possible way that LeBron doesn’t want to play on this #Cavs team. #LetEmKnow@Garland4Three @cavs @dariusgarland22 @KingJames @NBAAllStar Least he’ll get the dub in the gameVintage Cleveland Cavaliers Lebron James Jersey Youth Boys Small (8) Cavs NBA - https://t.co/zMmOYghvCs
