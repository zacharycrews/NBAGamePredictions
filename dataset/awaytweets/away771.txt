With that said, if they can't play .500 ball, I'd be a little concerned.One Hour to Tip:

#NBATwitter #GamblingTwitter #NBAPicks https://t.co/xkXWsvn2GNWith rumors swirling about Serge Ibaka potentially being bought, the Nets probably have intel on the chances it happens and the likelihood of luring Ibaka to Brooklyn.

If the Nets feel confident about landing Ibaka, it could free them up to offer Nic Claxton around for a wing.@MarkGre84321817 @IzzyJet771 @BrooklynNets When they played the Bucks he made Harden guard giannis. That is one of the worst machups you could do. Claxton could at least contest Giannis@BrooklynNets I hope this is a sign!

Nets arent making the finals. Their "team" is a mess. Theyve lost five straight in a row. You can blame health all you want, but good teams find ways to win.

Theyre not a good team.The Nets are in desperate need of another superstar quitting on their current team and demanding a trade to Brooklyn.

1) Blame the refs
2) Blame their coach
3) Blame their lack of "health"
4) Say they need to make trades for shooting and defense.

The fourth one is the only one that is true.Shaquille Harrison (2016 PIT, Tulsa) recorded a double-double (12 points &amp; 12 rebounds) adding 6 assists, 4 steals &amp; 2 blocks for Delaware Blue Coats (NBA G League) in loss to Westchester Knicks. Harrison has played for Brooklyn Nets &amp; Memphis Grizzlies this year. @TUMBasketball@Tony994445271 @BrooklynNets Youre making the same excuses every team makes when they lose to the Suns.

He was a great player but just an average coach. Last season we had Mike D’Antoni holding his hand. This year a different story.@BrooklynNets As Jack Bauer will always say... https://t.co/hORFZiD3Ke@netspIeasewin @BrooklynNets “you guys stink” sounds like someone who didn’t watch the hell these guys were put through.

FRAUD  FRAUDLike what the leagues beef with @BrooklynNets this year bro https://t.co/KSyD0xs226Brooklyn Nets are easily the most disappointing team this year. At this point I would fire Nash.

You guys committed so many fouls on harden and our other players and a goaltending to, but you guys got awarded with free throws instead. Nba said you can’t charge into players to get fouls anymore and that’s exactly what cris Paul did to edwards 😂@collado04 @BrooklynNets Next time just keep your thoughts to yourself@Dududurant1 @BrooklynNets @YESNetwork No team can handle nor want smoke when the big three are playing. It’s ever other time that’s hard🤦🏾‍♂️@BrooklynNets Please let Nash leave. The team's offense is disorganized and the defense is broken. In addition, can you trade people who have little effect, such as James Johnson and Bruce Brown, for someone who has real shooting and defense? I also think you need to use Darron Sharp more.@BrooklynNets Hope Sean marks enjoyed the L tonight, get this mf Nash of the team.@ParlayDoc @Paranormal_Bass @BrooklynNets I finally get a backdoor cover.

More info: https://t.co/NtM85ZSMhZ https://t.co/kmtRfoiVeaAll that game proves to me is that KD is the clear difference maker. Need that boy back ASAP @BrooklynNets@King2Goat @BrooklynNets He did but Sean Marks was bamboozled into thinking he would be a good HC@BrooklynNets The reality is We ain’t winning a Chip anytime soon but am up for the ride@BrooklynNets Between the bad refs and Kai not having help this was unacceptable a fully heathy nets can and HAVE beat this team. But it definitely won’t hurt to get some depth this deadline for Christ sake@Alex__Schiffer 3 minutes left you have two of the top 10 scorers in the league on your team down by 12 and he still pulls the starters the problem with the Brooklyn nets starts and ends with Steve Nash horrible rotations horrible defensive schemes this man should be an announcer not a coach@AlexIrving23 @BrooklynNets Harden uncle 🥸 https://t.co/WsyvQfVWGM@averagenetsfan @BrooklynNets it’s true@BrooklynNets It was nets vs refs a bit ngl@BrooklynNets Y’all ain’t climbing no where until easy money return@KyleSosa718 @BrooklynNets why didn’t they put in dayron smh@BrooklynNets Bad refs and steve nash is a horrible coach, he has to take a technical foul to make his presence felt and stick up for himself and the team. He's getting bullied by the refs and does not care whatsoever, fire Nash.@BrooklynNets cant even be mad at the guys that was the worst officiated game ever. kyrie and harden should’ve had 6-8 more free throws EACH and both the goal tends and fouls they gave the suns when the nets didn’t foul it was so frustrating to watch@BrooklynNets No shame losing to the best backcourt in the nba x@BrooklynNets This loss marks the end of the Durant n Kyrie era. If they truly loves their franchise, then they should retire before midnight. It is clear that we can no longer compete for championships with them. Thanks for the season, but it is time for you to go. Rebuild around Harden.@BEAUTlFULMAN @BrooklynNets This coming from a Portland fan ? 🤣🤣🤣🤮🤮🤮@BrooklynNets Sad to say, this roster that Mr. Sean Marks put up can't compete.Suns beat the Nets 121-111.

Phoenix shot better from the field, Brooklyn shot better from deep, but the Suns got this win at the stripe, going 26-31. Flurry of big and-ones even put them up for good in fourth.
