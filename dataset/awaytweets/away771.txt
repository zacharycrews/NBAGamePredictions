With that said, if they can't play .500 ball, I'd be a little concerned.One Hour to Tip:

#NBATwitter #GamblingTwitter #NBAPicks https://t.co/xkXWsvn2GNWith rumors swirling about Serge Ibaka potentially being bought, the Nets probably have intel on the chances it happens and the likelihood of luring Ibaka to Brooklyn.

If the Nets feel confident about landing Ibaka, it could free them up to offer Nic Claxton around for a wing.@MarkGre84321817 @IzzyJet771 @BrooklynNets When they played the Bucks he made Harden guard giannis. That is one of the worst machups you could do. Claxton could at least contest Giannis@BrooklynNets I hope this is a sign!
