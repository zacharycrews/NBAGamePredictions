We are running back the same reason as last night. No starters for the Wolves, Knicks are missing one starter, Thibs probably doesn't like Minnesota very much.

Barrett falling to 8 will anger Knicks fans. But what will tip them into blind rage is Claxton going 9th. 

I.e. not only were they the NBA team in New York that failed to sign Durant in 2019, they may not even have the city’s best prospect from that year’s rookie class.@zunitk @MSUBobcatsMBB @tyler_hall1 @nyknicks Just doing my part 👊@conchpicks that @nyknicks spread tho!Back NEW YORK KNICKS to BEAT Minnesota Timberwolves tonight in the @NBA (Game Starts at 01.10 GMT) #NBA #Basketball@bellyakim @ha3mhu Moral of the story is New York is no longer a “Knicks town” They don’t have superstars so therefore they suck and aren’t able to beat the Nets. The Nets are located in Brooklyn NY so that means New York is indeed a Nets town.This Oral History of how the Cincy Bearcats became an original Jordan Brand school in 1997 is amazing.

Regarding his creation, RJ is a really good passer and actually gets to the rim frequently when the defense respects his jump-shot. The problem is that he’s been really off from 3. Once that comes around, it’ll be clear how good he is#ReverseJinx alert ⚠️

The #Knicks, who are coming off a Christmas Day victory, have lost each of their last 10 games following a win. The last time they've won consecutive games was Oct. 26-30 when they won 3 straight games vs 76ers, Bulls and Pelicans

#NewYorkForever @nyknicks@Zan00737951 @nyknicks The point of giving him the keys is for his development, and he’s also a good creator when he’s not ice-cold from 3

Idk why you think he wouldn’t start on contending teams. He’s been off offensively so far this season, but he’s gonna end up having a great seasonConsensus Line Move:
