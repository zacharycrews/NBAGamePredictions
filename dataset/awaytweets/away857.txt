Orlando is as healthy as it has been in a long time with each of its top nine scorers all@Magic_PR @BallySportsFL @1045thebeat @NBA @OrlandoMagic @BallyMagic Hands down worst Magic uniMonday's Free Pick: Orlando Magic +11

The Orlando Magic are coming off two straight blowout road losses to the Utah Jazz and Phoenix Suns.  I expect a much better effort from them tonight as they take a step down in class here against the Denver Nuggets.The Orlando Magic are projected to finished with the 2nd worst record in the NBA at 21-61 according to https://t.co/VzpnMnT9Vf Who would you select for the Magic in the upcoming draft?..has been through just as much as the Knicks since Dwight left and whilst the Magic will never have the constant engagement irrespective of wins/losses that the Knicks, Celtics, etc might have, get a winning team in Orlando and the city comes alive.@OrlandoMagic AmazingConsensus Line Move:
2022-02-14 Orlando Magic at Denver Nuggets from 227.00 to 224.50
