And Atlanta jumps at the chance to make the move. I know how sum of you like to Tussle. @ATLHawks@PatrikJobless @ATLHawks @emoryhealthcare How are you feeling about the current state of the Hawks? Trae’s sensational but…@PatrikJobless @ATLHawks @emoryhealthcare Honestly I’ll just yield you that hypothetical Mavs series loss just since I’m so content with the Mavs’ current state of things@jamesle67719698 @smhvibe @ATLHawks @hornets @spectrumcenter @BallySportsSO @929TheGame @Hooters What?@stewscloos @ATLHawks @emoryhealthcare You’re right Stoo the Knicks most certainly packed up the Mavs in the first round (although according to Mav cultists that’s not possible - laughable even to think that 😂🤣😭) cause they actually were a top defensive team then not like when they blew you guys out the other day@PatrikJobless @ATLHawks @emoryhealthcare Hey honestly you may be right given that matchup seems to be horrible for the Mavs 😂 although the Knicks swept the hawks in the regular season last year too. Still doesn’t change the fact that the Mavs are better than the Hawks, they just matched up better with themSince when do the @ATLHawks have Football jerseys? https://t.co/LFUfQp9Ys0@stewscloos @ATLHawks @emoryhealthcare Stoo I think there’s enough evidence to say the Knicks would have packed Luka up in the first round now@CENC_Official @ATLHawks @collegiatesmg @SkillshotMedia Money moves 🔥Check out 2020-21 Panini Crown Royale Asia Red Trae Young #17 Atlanta Hawks https://t.co/xAf17j0nqX @eBay #traeyoung #Atlantahawks #nba #thehobbyThe Birds &amp; The Bees: Atlanta Hawks vs. Charlotte Hornets

#playerprops #NBA #AtlantaHawks https://t.co/FJTp5BHGKE@PatrikJobless @ATLHawks @emoryhealthcare Hawks, on the other hand, definitely will not be seeing the success of the ‘21 COVID-shortened season for quite some time… that is unless they acquire someone better than Trae… now that hawks fans are back to reality I can enjoy Trae’s masterclass performances though@PatrikJobless @ATLHawks @emoryhealthcare If Mavs win tonight they’re tied for 5th best record in the league with the Bucks (and Jazz if they win). Hawks fans will celebrate their when/if they lose in 7 in epic fashion to the Jazz while Mavs fans realize that our next 3 years will be better than the past 3 years…@PatrikJobless @ATLHawks @emoryhealthcare When did I claim to be smart? No one knows the future. You looked smart prior to the hawks run last year but also look really dumb considering how you and every hawks fan had them as a top 3 team in the East preseason. I’m just a dead clock that’s right twice a day@stewscloos @ATLHawks @emoryhealthcare Sure Stoo what ever makes it seem more real/valid for you…@stewscloos @ATLHawks @emoryhealthcare Stop you’re more worried about how you look in a twitter conversation 😂 Deflecting…redirecting…talking about ego. No doubt you’ve been told this before in the workplace but you come across as someone who thinks they’re smarter than they really are.@PatrikJobless @ATLHawks @emoryhealthcare You hate to see this level of sanity from a Mavs fan because I know there aren’t any sane Hawks fans given how they talk about their team@PatrikJobless @ATLHawks @emoryhealthcare If the Mavs lose to the jazz it’ll be fair and square. The Mavs roster is much better built around Luka this year to the point where they can’t be blamed entirely. This would be the first year he could justifiably be criticized for not beating his 1st round opponent IMO@PatrikJobless @ATLHawks @emoryhealthcare No one’s guaranteeing a first round win my guy 😂😂😂 just celebrating the hawks’ steep, steep regression. The warriors won 50 games and lost in the first round before they made their regular season leap… no one’s worried about whether the Mavs get the chance to lose to the suns@stewscloos @ATLHawks @emoryhealthcare Stoo you’re very pressed right now 😂 You’ve given me so much for the first round already I feel you’re going to give me some real gold if you keep going 😂🤣😭Atlanta Hawks Outlook For 09-10 https://t.co/OooMyN1z5R@PatrikJobless @ATLHawks @emoryhealthcare I mean you clearly need the ego boost so not surprised you can’t discuss basketball and would rather discuss me 😂 down to talk Luka/Trae/Mavs/hawks if the conversation doesn’t eat away at you too much 😂The Birds &amp; The Bees: @ATLHawks vs. @Hornets (@eldorado2452 &amp; @ChevelleCruz Preview)

He’s already proven most definitely that he’s a #1 on a championship team with no #2. Stop complaining.
