(@ Rocket Mortgage FieldHouse - @rmfieldhouse for @cavs @Bucks in Cleveland, OH) https://t.co/jE5yBkcPPI@swipakenta @Bucks @betwayusa The best thing about the cavs is they are getting better as the season progresses, and they are not losing to .500 or below teamsThe Bucks visit the surprising Cavaliers. Milwaukee will be without Grayson Allen (one-game suspension) and Wesley Matthewws (knee bruise).

       https://t.co/rbhzd9zJHz@IKE_Bucks @Bucks @Lakers It’s settled. Giannis is better.And that ladies and gentlemen would be the 22nd different starting lineup for your @Bucks this year. Ties for 2nd most in the NBA this year. #RosterRoullette #Bucks https://t.co/uAfjonTRCrCONGRATS @Bucks for the easy dub tonight, y'all winning by 70, I can put money you guys are winning that easily, anyway GGs, my cavs are so bad☹@Bucks Best possible lineupMay have spent too many hours in the car but seeing the @Bucks live is always worth the drive. https://t.co/nqgvXtI2JU@Cavs_House @Bucks @betwayusa Tonight is a real litmus test for these young guys@Cavs_House @Bucks @betwayusa I'm a Cavs fan too but we lost to this team healthy in early December"There's probably gonna be a lot of chitchat with the Bulls and the Bucks -- they wanna make that a thing now."

#GamblingTwitter #FreePicks #bettingtips #NBAThings I did not expect: 

If Cleveland beats Milwaukee tonight, the Cavs overtake the Bucks in the standing.@elerniesabe @swfcdylann @Bucks @MotorolaUS @BPortistime Blowout Cleveland?! I dont think so but I get where you are coming from. So better to go for the points rather than the rebounds?The last time the Bucks were in Cleveland, they won back-to-back games vs. Cavs including a 33-point outing from Giannis on Feb. 5, 2021.

This isn’t an easy pick because both teams are very good this season. Jarrett Allen is questionable, and if he doesn’t play then then this will impact their defense tremendously.

But even if I don't win, that's okay too. 

I approve of the mascot, you rarely find deer mascots in sports [aside from Bango of the Milwaukee Bucks]. https://t.co/qHAEcxFGlK@Danvito_ @MoreLikeBaeJ Yeah but don’t just look at that percentage cause he missed some wide open shots in game 7 that could have won that series. He was 1 for 11 in game 3 and 3 for 10 in game 7 against the bucks. He shot 34% from the field against Milwaukee that series lolCheck out this listing I just added to my #Poshmark closet: NBA CHAMPIONS MILWAUKEE BUCKS FACE MASK. MENS. ULTRA GAME.. https://t.co/AR6NAnsxm0 #shopmycloset @poshmarkapp@ybisbetterifear @Bucks They do it all the time.
