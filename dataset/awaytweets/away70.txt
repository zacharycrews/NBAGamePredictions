Big target for LIVE. 
Hopefully Raps go up by about 15. 

I'll probably bet em +9½ too in case they go to the front. 
I'll sprinkle some Money line too.According to our NBA History Book, two teams playing one another on tonight's card have been polar opposites from one another. Toronto is 9-0 SUATS in their last nine meetings vs Orlando. The Raptors are 12-2 ATS on Fridays while the Magic are currently 0-5 ATS on Fridays.@OrlandoMagic G-league starting 5SO THE RAPTORS HAVE THE FOURTH BEST DEFENCE IN THE NBA BUT THEYRE 2-3 SO THAT MEANS THEIR OFFENCE SUCKS GO ORLANDO LETS SEE SOME MAGIC TAKE THE 4x YOUR MONEY AND TAKE SAGE ADVICE FOM A GAMBLING CHICKENTonight's starting lineup for the Orlando Magic: Anthony, Suggs, Franz Wagner, Carter Jr., Bamba  https://t.co/bVWH4Av1bs@OrlandoMagic @Raptors @BallySportsFL @969thegame @jalensuggs @The_ColeAnthony Shameless Plug........

This isn't the Orlando MagicSharing my game notes ahead of tonight’s @OrlandoMagic vs @Raptors game. https://t.co/kVxCykcYqUCouple picks I like in @nba tonight
@Raptors / @OrlandoMagic o/206 this number just feels low, Raps could put up 110+ which doesn't leave much for Magic to cover this total.
@Pacers +8.5  either @Pacers are being under valued or @BrooklynNets over valued, this spread is too big.@OrlandoMagic so excited to be taking my 10 year old son to his first game on Wed (11/3). What time can we get into the arena?Thanks to former @OrlandoMagic Center Stanley Roberts for signing my Fleer card #Fleer #Hobby #TTM #TTMSuccess #Collect #Autograph https://t.co/SJYovB90E6Let’s predict Suggs and Scottie Barnes stat lines tonight. I’ll go first!!

Suggs - 17 pts, 7 rebs, 5 asts, 2 blks, 1 stls

Barnes - 21 pts, 11 rebs, 3 asts, 1 blk, 2 stls

https://t.co/a9Bfd1G4ej@hazelboy_16 @OrlandoMagic @TheRealMoBamba @AdventHealth I saw him do a great job of protecting the rim late in the 4th quarter vs the Hornets.  They came right at him….he didn’t foul and defended well.@OrlandoMagic @The_ColeAnthony @franzboogie @Sam_Vecenie Thank you for this I love you https://t.co/q4CcGZb95q@OrlandoMagic @The_ColeAnthony @franzboogie @Sam_Vecenie How long until I can buy a 75th anniversary Wagner Jersey?@infinite_bagel Seattle used to have the Supersonics until like 2008 so you're probably remembering that, they're now the Oklahoma City Thunder. Basketball fandom is alien to me because Tampa never had a team but now I'm in Orlando and have the Magic but...maybe I'll just stick with hockey lol
