1) 23-13 overall.

2) 7-1 against Nets, Bucks, Bulls, Jazz.

3) Haven’t been fully healthy ONCE.

4) Have played 4 more road games than home (and have 5 more road games on this trip).

They're not taking on contracts unless the player is a for sure top 8 rotation player.The #Heat have become a standard of both finding and integrating young talent seamlessly. Jimmy Butler, Bam Adebayo, PJ Tucker and others are going to be so fresh come playoff time. Struts, Vincent, Guy and more have had big games for Miami this past month.@shakira @MiamiHEAT Happy moments For your fansNot a bad debut for @haywood24_7 and the @MiamiHEAT 🔥🔥

He scored nine points and went 3-3 from beyond the arc in a win over the Houston Rockets #GoCards
