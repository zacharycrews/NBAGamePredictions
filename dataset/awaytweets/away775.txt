Toronto Raptors ML vs Chicago Bulls @ 1.77 (Sbtech)
Miami Heat -3.5 vs San Antonio Spurs @ 1.92 (Sbtech)
can probably find on other bookies too, good luck@GracieAlfonso71 @MiamiHEAT Yes you are right Raptors want to prove that they the number 8 seed can compete. Y’all heat fans are mocking them down when u guys defeated them.And see what happened it turn the other way around😂.I forgot that the @MiamiHEAT have Oladipo too. 
Crazy to think they were in 1st place without him. #HEATCulture@arinfightinibis True, but we have to keep the same heat on these coaches. Miami has ducked for too damn long. I don't care who the coach is. We have to keep that pressure. Mistake Diaz got comfortable and look what happen.The real issue with Miami fans (some) is that they want Bam to save the Heat. And bc he’s not saving the Heat he gets the brunt of blame bc he doesn’t have the dominating personality like Jimmy and Herro. Bosh got the same flack but look at how Heat fans talk about him NOW.Miami Heat the only classy organization I follow, the rest are trash 🗑 https://t.co/7cQ9lixyMH@MiamiHEAT @gdann27 @JimmyButler I noticed he did that just a few games back… his inner D Wade@chrisboshfanacc @MiamiHEAT That’s funny🤣😂These are the plays i like for tomorrow

The Clippers can win without Kawhi and Paul George.

The Denver can without Jamal Murray and MPJr .

And the Lakers can't win with two superstars playing?? Who is the problem here? #trash #lakersThe East did Miami a lot of favors tonight. Cleveland lost, Sixers lost, Nets lost.

#LEGENDoftheMiamiHEAT #NBA75@The_Zwaj @jack__light @thenormalone31 @tbgrondin @FanMahome @HoopMixOnly That Spurs team was a dynasty. Miami Heat were nearing break down at 2014, and everyone besides LeBron played like shit(Wade averaged 15ppg, not to mention his injuries). Don't disrespect the 2014 Spurs, they played an extremely efficient game and otherworldly passing.@GioCorner @BigT55230513 @BallyHEAT @MiamiHEAT Yeah &amp; u keep on losing to a weak franchise. What an embarassment. Triple overtime lost. 3 days after lost again. Trent Jr owned your poverty team.
