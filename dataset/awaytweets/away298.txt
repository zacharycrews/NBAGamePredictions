Was looking for a minute like Utah might start to pull away, but a few late defensive miscommunications yielded some good looks for New Orleans. Bogey with 13p for the Jazz; Kira Lewis with 6 off the bench for the Pels.The New Orleans Pelicans are at a crossroads. Zion Williamson's return is around the corner but can he bring them up from 14th in the West? @MarcoHolJef writes about where things stand for the Smoothie King Center residents.
