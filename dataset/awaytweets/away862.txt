This week, y‚Äôall.When I think Boston sports, I think about guys like Brady, Pierce, Chara‚Ä¶ Guys who loved being the villains. Mac Jones &amp; Tatum don‚Äôt fit that personality to me. However, Marchand is a perfect mold. @celtics &amp; @Patriots, draft douchebags pls‚Ä¶ #NHLTwitter #BleedGreen #ForeverNEsince i know yall were wondering, the boston celtics have won 8 games in a row and 10 of their last 11 üòäIs @celtics forward Robert Williams an All-Star snub? Timelord currently has the highest offensive rating in NBA history! He is also tied for the league lead in defensive rating this season! #Celtics #NBAstats #NBAAllStar@isaiahthomas When are the @celtics signing you bro? We about to riot at the delay@isaiahthomas @celtics have to sign you ASAP! It would be great to see you in that green &amp; white jersey Whoop Whoop.@fuutuuuree @william_lou U must be talking about the Celtic Football Club cuz the Boston Celtics of the NBA are above your team in the standings#Pistons game recap:

Well, that's another loss for the Pistons. Defense was better today but offense was basically nonexistent. Special shout-out to Bey and Bagley as they both had solid games today.
