Marvin Bagley III to Detroit, Donte DiVincenzo to Sacramento and Ibaka to Milwaukee. Josh Jackson and Trey Lyles to Sacramento as part of the deal, while the Clippers will get Rodney Hood and Semi Ojeleye from the Bucks 💥

#NBA #NBATwitter #NBATradeDeadline https://t.co/WwYcPcBfrXI'm sorry but I do not think the Harden trade gives Philly the edge over the @Bucks I just don't think Harden is all that right now. I like this deal more for Brooklyn, but due to the Kyrie situation and KD's injury, it might not turn into what the @BrooklynNets hope@TheHoopCentral The Milwaukee Bucks, until proven otherwiseSecond move of the deadline, Rockets sent Pj Tucker and a 2nd round pick to the Bucks for Dj Augustin, a 2022 first round pick (Josh Christopher) and a 2023 first round pick.

Win win trade, we got good value for tucker and PJ helped Milwaukee  win a championship before leaving. https://t.co/cmUXrc7KNRBreaking News: Milwaukee Bucks acquire Serge Ibaka from the Clippers in a four team trade including the Kings and the Pistons.

These ex players are living 12 years in the past with these takes. But even with during Kohl's era I mean come on MKE is better for NBA players than SLC, OKC, or Detroit.Let’s gooooo!!!

He spaces the floor for Giannis, still has gas in the tank on both ends &amp; arguably does what Brook does better than Brook! James Harden awaits. #NBA #NBATradeDeadline #ThursdayThoughts #FearTheDeerThe Milwaukee Bucks get Serge Ibaka??  Repeat!!!!!! #NBATradeDeadline@jennessa__ @Bucks That’s a whole different story tho. Everybody feel different but mostly everybody have the same thoughts about the city. But all that matters is the bucks made some moves 🔥@BucksCommunity @Bucks @SargentoCheese @HabitatMKE Did my boy dirtyNotes:

#1 - The Kings will need to waive/trade 2 more players on their roster. So we will see if the Kings possibly make another move. Good move for Sacramento

#2 - Milwaukee gets a good backup C. Clippers didn't really need him anyways. Bucks now have 3 open roster spots...Me being disgusted about Serge going to the Milwaukee Bucks has absolutely nothing to do with his basketball skills lol@TheNBACentral In the name of the Milwaukee Bucks I am here to offer you 2 second round draft picks and Lindell Wigginton@JG_GizmoJones what the fuck are we giving up a first round pick for and on what earth do I wanna see serge as a Milwaukee Buck?

Ibaka to the @Bucks is their golden ticket back to the finals at this point.@Dmoney6_ @Bucks I just said remember when no one wanted to come play for the Bucks because now people actually WANT to come here. That’s all. Regardless of who signs or not. That’s all the tweet meant.The L.A.

They now have a $54.4M luxury tax payment and a $213.6M payroll + tax combo.

They are now also down to 12 players. They’ll have two weeks to get back to 14 if they don’t acquire additional players today. https://t.co/WjfM0Oa68SDRAGIC TO MKE PLS @Goran_Dragic @Bucksthe Milwaukee Bucks are on pace to have the most handsome team in the league 💚 s/o to management@BucksCommunity @Bucks @SargentoCheese @HabitatMKE W trade but i’ll miss donte@CjpPerkins6 @Bucks I’m predicting a bledsoe reunion honestly 😂 shame they’re missing on Thad Young.

Teams (especially Miami needs to prepare for that). You cannot win against Milwaukee if you lack size. Do we need to make a move to acquire another big or do we thinkg Bam, Dewayne and Omer is enough?@bucks going SUPER big. Ibaka, Lopez (if he ever gets healthy), Giannis, AND Portis?? Love the move, gonna miss Dante though....serge ibaka is a milwaukee buck 🥰💚 https://t.co/jYZvqAPYNc@itsjwills Milwaukee is such a secret gem.  I've never heard of a Buck actually wanting to leave aside from Kareem, and that was back in the 70's.@TheRealKeithJr @Bucks I hope they make good use of the available roster spots.  Adding serge is good. Now we need a good wing player or another good guardJon Horst trades would get vetoed in any and every fantasy league.

An all around fundamental basketball player that works hard. Any team will be happy to have @Divincenzo but I’m heartbroken.@CowhideGlobe Yeah, this team is looking up at the Timberwolves so i don’t know why they’re talking about Milwaukee lol, they’re multiple tiers below the Bucks.It just makes sense for Goran Dragić to seriously consider signing with the Milwaukee Bucks for a real shot at a title this late in his career upon being bought out by the San Antonio Spurs. #HEATCulture might hate to hear it, but I’d like to think Goran would fit in well there. https://t.co/Ofm9756sDYcan the @bucks get their 2nd Rd pick back...kings clearly loved DONTE

Serge can grab some boards and plays decent defense. As long as he doesn't fall in love with 3-ball too much, he makes a good role player.

Hopefully, Milwaukee goes "BUCK-2-BUCK" this year.Ibaka on the @Bucks 😳 yeah they winning it again@sergeibaka to the @Bucks !

@KendrickPerkins @ESPNNBAI like this for the @Bucks!!! https://t.co/DAtMo2UQdMThe @Bucks stabbed @Divincenzo in the back.

BIG Bucks move. 

Sad to see Donte go but he never refound that role since his injury. Good luck to him.

👏👏 @Bucks https://t.co/XyYVBRplef@IKE_Bucks @IKE_Packers Giving up Donte, Rodney, and Semi to get Serge. I hate seeing Donte go. All he’s ever done is give his heart and soul to this @Bucks team.🇺🇸 Really like Serge Ibaka ad backup Center for the Bucks. They had to give up some depth, but they needed someone behind Portis and they got a true pro

🇮🇹 Mi piace Serge Ibaka per Milwaukee. Hanno sacrificato profondità, ma avevano bisogno di un centro di riserva

Part of the moving parts in 4-team trade.@LukaChikadze1 @FunkyDiabetic1 I feel like he could thrive under that Bucks system tho. Space the floor and protect the rim.

Per Justin AtkinsGood pick up for Milwaukee. I would’ve flipped Mathews and kept DiVincenzo tho but still an overall solid deal. Oh yeah and bucks are going back to back. (Like I’ve been saying all year!) They looking like the 2019 raptors rn https://t.co/JkjIdPpRBPI love this trade for the Bucks. Serge Ibaka is a winning big who can defend and stretch the floor. Sad to see Donte go, but this is a home run for Milwaukee! #FearTheDeer #NBA https://t.co/jTlW4KbH6GSources tell me that Giannis Antetokounmpo is on pace to win his 3rd MVP and 2nd DPOY award, per @espn. Unsurprising for the Milwaukee @Bucks star.The Bucks will now have three open roster spots once Monroe is done with his 10-day contract. They'll be active in the buyout market.

Also, with the additional seconds, I wouldn't be surprised if Milwaukee makes another move yet.THE MILWAUKEE BUCKS ARE ABOUT TO KICK THE TIRES AND LIGHT THE FIRES!!!!! THEY LEAVE A  VAPOR TRAIL WHEN THEY PASS THE ROCK!!!!! POPPIN 3s AND CRUSHING MASTERFUL DUNKS!!!!!

https://t.co/faTc5WKR5WSerge Ibaka is a GREAT get for the @Bucks, especially if Lopez continues to be out. Sad to see Donte go but, judging by recent trends, he’ll be back on the team in 2-3 years #Bucksin6@Bucks Marcus Smart for Giannis? Who says noAll is forgiven for Boogie now @Bucks 🤝@JDavidwalker I don't think so. The Bucks were not paying Donte this summer, plus with Grayson and Pat he was expendable. So the Bucks got some badly needed picks for him. Serge could help for 10~13mins too.

♦︎ @sixers immediately become a Finals favorite (at least tied with @bucks, @suns &amp; @warriors).
♦︎ @BrooklynNets won't win a title soon: Simmons + Kyrie =  insane drama.  But the Beard's contract is expiring, and maybe they get Seth Curry too. https://t.co/ICX8U5pOVi@AdamRicho11 @JakePhilips16 @Kareem_is_it You guys sound crazy. Tht had 25 and 12 rebounds vs the bucks in Milwaukee.  Dude said clogging up lanes and he only took two shots inside the three point line.Why is Grayson Allen still in thec NBA?  I wish that Milwaukee would send him kicking a bean can down that dusty ole road so I could watch them play again. I refuse to watch or support the @Bucks as long as he is on their roster. And I hate it! Sorry @BPortistime, dude is evil.@NBA @BPortistime @Bucks Happy Birthday 🎂@KingTechnical08 @NBA @BPortistime @Bucks Damn thats crazy. Oh well, still champs though!The Bucks and Celtics are still keeping in touch regarding a Dennis Schroder-Donte DiVincenzo swap, sources tell @celticsblog.

Last Bucks game I saw was in Milwaukee, Game 4. I need to wash that shit out my mouth!@AKBLJS @Raptors @Bucks @BrooklynNets @MiamiHEAT @sixers @Pacers Again, i could be wrong and I'm 100% willing to listen to experts and/or good reasoning.

I get that the East is a crapshoot - Milwaukee is the only thing close to a sure thing, but I don't see the Raps making a deep run just by adding Myles Turner.@Jumpshot8 @NBA @Suns @Bucks Go Suns!@Jumpshot8 @NBA @Suns @Bucks Wine is good, but I gotta bump some 21 Savage. Lol@AKBLJS @Raptors @Bucks @BrooklynNets @MiamiHEAT @sixers @Pacers I like Myles Turner a lot - but he's injured for at least another month and the Raps would only control him until next season.

Not sure the Raps are one player away from title contention [this year for sure]@DeedsWylie @Raptors @Bucks @BrooklynNets @MiamiHEAT @sixers @Pacers Maybe been out the ball game too long but thought Myles that guy@at_159when @balldontstop @Bucks Tyreke Evans: 1 ROTY Giannis: no ROTY so is it even a questionNot sure I like this trade that much for the @Raptors - they take on a LOT of salary for two guys that won't put them over the top vs. @Bucks  @BrooklynNets or even @MiamiHEAT &amp; @sixers 

@Pacers get a LOT of assets + cap space.

But I'm willing to be convinced otherwise. https://t.co/EiriCRi5Wk@TheJohnnyWeeknd @Bucks @Giannis_An34 Joel Embiid being slept on rn@ClutchPointsApp @AntDavis23 ,"Bro what just happened?"

How’s westbricks contract btw@IUsed2Dunk @Bucks @statmuse @paysbig @Giannis_An34 Most people that were on the "AD is better" train have jumped off the train. There's no way a critical, sane mind would make that argument now! Giannis is becoming maybe the most gifted BBaller ever? And he's a great guy too! BBall couldn't be better in the city of Milwaukee!@Bucks @pconnaughton Almost took down Kentucky in 2015 but @BadgerMBB took care of business 😎@Bucks @pconnaughton Poor man’s Giannis@Bucks @statmuse @paysbig @Giannis_An34 Giannis has incredibly good Karma and anyone who criticizes him is likely to end up with their foot in their mouth! Criticize his shooting? He goes 16-16 in All Star game or he goes perfect from the foul line or something like the above.@ryansperry98 @KawhisFavBurner @Bucks @PINITUSA Go Buckaroos Go!
#DeerDrive back to the @NBA Finals!!
#FearTheDeer@Bucks Check out Bobby’s eyes!  Never mind…always like that!@Bucks @PINITUSA Expose those frauds @BucksMilwaukee Bucks - Sideline OB Play for Kris Middleton

Misdirection for a shot or iso on the wing https://t.co/k4PFscKn2m@Bucks Get someone to look at you like Bobby 👀 https://t.co/evKqbSQ7J4@TheJohnnyWeeknd @Bucks @Giannis_An34 This stat is so skewed@Bucks Zoomed in and screenshot Bobby… then thought to myself, I need to have more faith in others. Not disappointed with the immediate line of Bobby screenshots commented.@Bucks Wallpaper Wednesday @BPortistime https://t.co/FUjSTRFEuW@JakeJMaier @KingCrab1984 I understand where you are coming from. If it doesn't happen then hope some other activity by the Bucks is done. Schroder in a Milwaukee uniform would definitely improve the bench.@Bucks I never do this be #LeBullied. #FearTheDeer@omgmarcowave @GiannisLamar_ @Bucks fair enough@TheLakersReview I like this 1st Unit:
Avery Bradley = Defense and 3-pointers.
Trevor Ariza = Defense and 3-pointers.
Allowed 60 points in the paint area against the Milwaukee Bucks.@Bucks @PINITUSA See u tomorrow!!!@Bucks @pconnaughton This white man CAN jump! LOLThis is pure bliss. #BucksInSix @bucks @lockedonbucks https://t.co/pwln5O4aGhToday was in fact not the day Dennis Schröder and Grant Williams became Milwaukee Bucks. https://t.co/euK6CYvccj@rapshreett @Bucks @PINITUSA Not to mentionhh The valley ope and the valley oops@rapshreett @Bucks @PINITUSA Yet another part of the statement that is true@officialpollman @Bucks @PINITUSA I mean we kinda really do .
