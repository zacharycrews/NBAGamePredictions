#NBA #NBATwitter #NBATradeDeadline https://t.co/WwYcPcBfrXI'm sorry but I do not think the Harden trade gives Philly the edge over the @Bucks I just don't think Harden is all that right now. I like this deal more for Brooklyn, but due to the Kyrie situation and KD's injury, it might not turn into what the @BrooklynNets hope@TheHoopCentral The Milwaukee Bucks, until proven otherwiseSecond move of the deadline, Rockets sent Pj Tucker and a 2nd round pick to the Bucks for Dj Augustin, a 2022 first round pick (Josh Christopher) and a 2023 first round pick.

Last Bucks game I saw was in Milwaukee, Game 4. I need to wash that shit out my mouth!@AKBLJS @Raptors @Bucks @BrooklynNets @MiamiHEAT @sixers @Pacers Again, i could be wrong and I'm 100% willing to listen to experts and/or good reasoning.

I get that the East is a crapshoot - Milwaukee is the only thing close to a sure thing, but I don't see the Raps making a deep run just by adding Myles Turner.@Jumpshot8 @NBA @Suns @Bucks Go Suns!@Jumpshot8 @NBA @Suns @Bucks Wine is good, but I gotta bump some 21 Savage. Lol@AKBLJS @Raptors @Bucks @BrooklynNets @MiamiHEAT @sixers @Pacers I like Myles Turner a lot - but he's injured for at least another month and the Raps would only control him until next season.

Not sure the Raps are one player away from title contention [this year for sure]@DeedsWylie @Raptors @Bucks @BrooklynNets @MiamiHEAT @sixers @Pacers Maybe been out the ball game too long but thought Myles that guy@at_159when @balldontstop @Bucks Tyreke Evans: 1 ROTY Giannis: no ROTY so is it even a questionNot sure I like this trade that much for the @Raptors - they take on a LOT of salary for two guys that won't put them over the top vs. @Bucks  @BrooklynNets or even @MiamiHEAT &amp; @sixers 

@Pacers get a LOT of assets + cap space.

But I'm willing to be convinced otherwise. https://t.co/EiriCRi5Wk@TheJohnnyWeeknd @Bucks @Giannis_An34 Joel Embiid being slept on rn@ClutchPointsApp @AntDavis23 ,"Bro what just happened?"
