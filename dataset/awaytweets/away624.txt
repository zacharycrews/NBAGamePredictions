He’s taken a total of 22 shots in the clutch this year. Yes he’s made 16 of them but 22 is a horribly small number for a ‘star’ player.

https://t.co/7dPTrWnK14@Suns @DeandreAyton @CP3 @DevinBook GS lost to MB. Similar to ECF 3rd game bet MB &amp; NN. GA's attack fr start. Loonie lack of quickness to stop.  All Buckers got hot and scored like crazy.  GS revealed lack of athletic player (00 is OK, but new), &amp; ball dribbling when pressed.I love the @Suns and many people hates them and thinks that their achievement last season is a fluke.

Keep hatin', I couldn't care less. I'll stick to them to the very end.
