The C’s close out the short handed Bucks on the home court. They possess the better team and it’s not even close. Giannis needs some help and has had to backpack all series to force this game.

#BostonCeltics #MilwaukeeBuck #NBAvg,@Harpo_kenz @DjJackcheese @DerekSiroin @BleacherReport @wojespn You are comparing Robert Williams to the Bucks 2nd best overall player. They are not comparable. 🤣 I'm not making an excuse. Idc I'm not a Bucks fan. But to say the Celtics would be in a Game 7 with Milwaukee if Middleton is healthy is just dumb. Because they wouldn't be.[🎥LIVE🥊]

Milwaukee Bucks to win the NBA championship +950

It won’t be easy, and the most likely outcome is a dead ticket today. But they have a real shot, so play the number. My case at @ActionNetworkHQ:

#PMSFanDuelSunday7sGot the MIL Bucks +5 with the added boost to +168. Giannis may be short handed in a Game 7 against a good defensive Celtics team at home. But I think this a fairly close game down stretch with Milwaukee having good chance at outright win.

#GamblingTwitter #NBAPlayoffsOk @Bucks fans! They got this. I picked em to go 7. It's a tough road. Going to get tougher #FearTheDeer #DestinyIsAll @BucksBango @DeerDistrict @DeerDistrictVIP @FiservForum https://t.co/yb9oHhMDSoWorried about the Buffalo shooting but not much about the Milwaukee Bucks shooting  after the game. I can only imagine why. Seems to me different set of rules. I remember when a car drove over 19 people in Wachasau, Wisconsin.  I said a car, not an assailant.

LolIf the Bucks lose today: welp, Boston is really good, and Milwaukee didn’t have enough.

If the Bucks win today: welp, Boston is really good, and Milwaukee didn’t have enough, BUT THEY STILL PULLED IT OFF!

This series has wildly jacked with my emotional and logical thinking with basketball.   

#FearTheDeer@GMGTCom1052 @superichkidsss @Bucks They definitely would. You clearly lack understanding of why crimes occur. Take a fucking sociology class. Would 100% of guns and ammo go away? Obviously not. Would they become scarce and significantly reduce killings and suicides? Fuck yes.@sinanaral @elonmusk @dallasmavs @Suns @celtics @Bucks Agreed on that. But isn’t that pretty impossible in practice? How humans moderate is based on what their deep beliefs are which is always somehow ties to politics 🤷🏻‍♂️@celtics can’t let any room for the @Bucks to get ahead today. Let’s  wrap this series up on home court and move on to Miami! #CelticNation@Bucks As a fan that got caught up in the melee on Friday, thank you for this decision. It's unfortunate that it had to be made. #BucksIn7@Bucks let's go bucks@vincemarrow It's sad!

Curious if charging $5 would assist with a lot of the loitering that seems to be happening more this year.@Bucks It’s the right call.@Courtney_SiskTV @Bucks @WISN12News All it takes is a few idiots to ruin things for everyone.  So disgusting.@Bucks I personally felt that the Deer District didn't open enough viewing space, allocate more large televisions, and left an enormous amount of people without a space or place to view in the downtown area.@Pale_Pete @TonyBigzz01 @MattyBuckets3 @Bucks I disagree strongly!@idontmiss111 @Bucks yeah people been getting shot for decades on decades now@Michael_Haz @Courtney_SiskTV @WISN12News @Bucks There is no event tonight@Bucks 🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️ peopleUPDATE: Shootings near Milwaukee Bucks playoff game prompt curfew https://t.co/Xj2XQTKINZ@Courtney_SiskTV @Bucks @WISN12News Right thing to do@Bucks The rotation gonna be very tight tomorrow, Giannis will be a beast, I hope khris will play, I expect Grayson, Portis to have at least 12 points each…

Where did I say all Bucks fans are saints?@Bucks Why we need to have all gun owners own major insurance to pay for this instead of taxpayers and businesses. Cameras on every street in major cities. It’s insane.@bucks this why y’all tied 3-3 https://t.co/lEqmO7tN0nIf you surprised by what happened in the Deer District congrats on being located in a privileged place as a Bucks fan. This is Milwaukee and where Fiserv is located is near where I grew up &amp; stayed till 2 years ago.

Game 7s make legends. Can we get another battle like we saw in game 6?
