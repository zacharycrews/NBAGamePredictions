#NBA75 https://t.co/rX6bggquVHOne of their losses came 123-115 as 6-point road favorites against these Oklahoma City Thunder.  Now they are laying 14.5 points in the rematch and still aren't at full strength.  And this is an Oklahoma City team that has been very competitive in recent games against goodThursday's Free Pick: Oklahoma City Thunder +14.5

The Los Angeles Lakers cannot be trusted to cover big numbers like this.  They are just 2-6 ATS this season and haven't beaten anyone by more than 12 points.  Three of their five wins came by 4 points or fewer this season.GAMEDAY.
