We weren't sure why it's the Utah "Jazz". And our hypothesis was correct. 
a. Jazz b/c of its definition in the dictionary: collective improvisation. 
b. Team began its inaugural season in #NewOrleans in the 1974–75 season.

My cousin worked for the Jazz for years. Said Jerry Sloan was a great guy. You want anybody named Sloan? Lol.Former NBA star Dwyane Wade is a part-owner of the Utah Jazz. He has a transgender kid. 

The governor of Utah has one job, keep the Jazz happy and keep them from leaving Utah.

Age has nothing to do with it.@bflex1985 @JamesHaymitch @kevmoe20 @GovCox @RyanQualtrics @utahjazz This is correct. And whether or not you win it still costs the state a ton to defend. Making gov Cox reasoning about money ridiculous. I'm glad some people see it.@JamesHaymitch @kevmoe20 @20blakeBlake @GovCox @RyanQualtrics @utahjazz What about the lawsuits on the other side?

Music themed sports teams, STL Blues, Utah Jazz, etc. should have a theme song played live, with a big band. Who doesn’t like jazz and blues music?

Perhaps “Affirmation (live version)” by George Benson.Next game gon be trash 
@utahjazz @LAClippers @NBAonTNT@ruthymess Remember, Utah Jazz is 2 games right behind us. Dallas Mavericks isn't far behind. Plenty of games to play bfr regular season over. We are looking at maybe 5th seeds. losing home Court advantage in the playoff is costly 😔☀️𝚂𝚞𝚖𝚖𝚎𝚛 𝙲𝚊𝚖𝚙𝚜 &amp; 𝙲𝚕𝚒𝚗𝚒𝚌𝚜☀️
