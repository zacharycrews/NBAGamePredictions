That‚Äôs way more than can be said for the Sacramento Kings!The Chiefs should change their name within the next few seasons and I‚Äôm a proponent of changing it to the Kansas City Kings for two reasons: 

1) it‚Äôs a nod to the old NBA Kings before they left for Sacramento 
2) it ties in with the Chiefs Kingdom phenomenonWell at least I have my @SacramentoKings to fall back on.
