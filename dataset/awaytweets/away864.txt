That‚Äôs the wildest take I‚Äôve ever heard. @MotorCityHoops@Three_Cone @PelicansNBA @hornets @okcthunder all 3 of you have the power to bring these back at some point@DimeDropperPod I support the Hornets from afar lol but I‚Äôm super exited about the team making a name for themselves cuz it‚Äôs been way too long since the Hornets been this good. I hope some day Melo finds away to get Charlotte to the finalsCongratulations to PBrosevelt (@PatrickTheElder) who moved up 2 spots to take #10 on the Charlotte Hornets team leaderboard.

the pelicans did, shitheadCharlotte Hornets‚Äô LaMelo Ball, San Antonio Spurs‚Äô Dejounte Murray named to NBA All-Star Game as injury¬†replacements https://t.co/9FK0XZWQbSIsn‚Äôt it wild how Chris Kroeger was fired by the Hornets nearly 3 years ago and the story never really got out as to why?

https://t.co/GqUR03MVPC16/13/4 this is your loss @hornets@TheTick3t Charlotte Hornets!!!! Would love to see LaMelo live@FuchsOfficial @hornets @CharlotteFC Great to see you boys hanging out with each other.Y‚Äôall never got to see the guy in head to toe Charlotte Hornets gear at the gym this morning. It was quite the outfit.@Djbienaime Yea here in Charlotte I‚Äôve heard it with Lamelo at the line. I‚Äôm a Hornets fan and admit that it‚Äôs lame. Much smaller city though and at least he‚Äôs better than Randle üòÇ@hornets @Arthurlee_M @thorrjt @ArrowExt He‚Äôs going to be something truly special in the NBA
And he‚Äôs part of the @hornets family. #Epic@DannyTRadio That‚Äôs probably it. Between the Panthers and Hornets, it fits the city‚Äôs scheme. Though maybe they could have taken from the old Charlotte Knights logo and done blue and green. Here‚Äôs hoping there‚Äôs enough fan support to #GoMint ? https://t.co/BaUV4z59oFlist of some of my favorite commentators (by team):
