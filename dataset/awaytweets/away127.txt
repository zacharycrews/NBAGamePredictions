The Cavs are one of the better teams in the leage ats as they are 6-3 and have won 2/3 games this season on the road despite being major underdogs. I love them here against a Raptors team that are 2-3 at home this year and 5-4 ats.Anyway Cleveland Cavaliers is 5-4 this season. More room for improvement. Playoffs is the targetThe Lakers look to rebound from this loss in their next game against the Portland Trailblazers, who are coming off their third-straight loss against the Cleveland Cavaliers.  https://t.co/VivHuu1E5ZALERT: New high roller bet posted!
