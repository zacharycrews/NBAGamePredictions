Heat are sharks on both ends, Denver can’t score, no MPJ so a super short (literally) rotation, huge bench advantage for Miami. I don’t see an edge for Denver. If you were building a center to battle Jokic it would probably look like Bam. https://t.co/vc0FHAbyCk10 mins until Miami Heat Basketball, shoutout to the Heat fans staying up for all these games during the west coast trip! #HEATCulture🔥🔥🔥 https://t.co/e4lsDqXBk8The @MiamiHEAT's starting five for tonight! #HEATCulture https://t.co/l0hKRAlFzLThe @MiamiHEAT's starting five for tonight! #HEATCulture https://t.co/tSPYOcUiqF@rotato2000 @jawsaholic the Miami heat had a game like this around a week ago where did not look a basketball team at all, it is important how to respond after a lossAssista NBA Denver Nuggets x Miami Heat Ao vivo

Sorry to miss you when you’re here but see you in June for the finals (we have a spare bedroom you can use and I can make chicken wings.)@LakersNation You don’t run SET PLAYS that get Wayne Ellington cutting from wing-to-wing just before the catch.

Heat also carry the fourth-best defensive rating in the league. https://t.co/ctgO4KL6pV🏀 Miami Heat -1.5 - 10/11 (2 units)

Similar defensively but just about every single offensive stat shows Miami are a superior team. Few examples;

3 Pointers - 7th/29th
Offensive Rebounds - 1st/26th
Free throws awarded - 7th/30th https://t.co/SCv4WYrnWT@TakesWereMade_ Btw in option one the Heat win the finals, and the knicks would proceed to get owned by Miami for years to come.

Miami can beat the Ravens....the schedule really could set up a nice little run for miami.... listen we ain't making no playoffs but if coach Flo can roll off about 6 wins in a row...with this team...that could take some heat off him.@souljaboy's reaction when he got his Miami Heat 'City' edition jersey 😂

(via @FTXArena) https://t.co/P7ddBBnkOj@SoberMiamiFan @MFlo612 @DracoBuckets7 @Bucks_Take @Heat4life01 UD is the only player on your roster who has a Miami ring. The Heat organization has been successful in the past but this current iteration is bubble madeDolphins won. Heat won. UM football won. Panthers won. FIU soccer beat No.1 Marshall. Inter Miami upset first-place New England. Quite a weekend for South Florida sports! @MiamiDolphins @MiamiHEAT @FlaPanthers @InterMiamiCF @CanesFootball @FIUMensSoccer2U Miami Heat -1.5 (-115)

-Both teams are top 5 in defensive rankings..but nuggets offense rank 26th at 101.6 PPG while heat rank 3rd at 113 PPG
-MPJ is out I believe, and Joker will have to carry a major load to even stay in this
-Heat are doing much better then nuggets ATS L5 https://t.co/mqutl4zeeJnot the flight attendant looking at my miami heat mask and saying it should be chicago bulls@FitzySA @AFL Miami Heat: Every Monday, players are weighed and their body fat percentage is measured. The team goal is everyone under 10 percent body fat. Every player on the roster met the goal – mainly because they were too scared to find out the consequences.@FitzySA @AFL None of the AFL kids would survive at the Miami Heat!All that snow after watching 8 seasons in Miami's heat was a beautiful change I approve!
