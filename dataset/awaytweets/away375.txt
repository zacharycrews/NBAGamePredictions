Like I said odds are they caught it early but if the hole that is leaking air is big surgery or a tube is needed and in the rare case it‚Äôs that critical surgery might be needed.

Trade CJ, Simons, Covington, one 1st round pick and a dozen Voodoo Donuts@jordanmckeown__ @ShamsCharania @trailblazers Never said he wouldn‚Äôt. Wasn‚Äôt talking about him.Been thinking about how terrible the Mavs social media is

This kinda quickly sums it up
