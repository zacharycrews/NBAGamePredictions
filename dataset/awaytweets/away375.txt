Throw the kitchen sink and all our future picks. LFG #RipCity@trailblazers You guys need to get Sabonis and Lavert!!!! Not ben Simmons!!Portland Trail blazers need to get Sabonis and Lavert!!!! Not ben Simmons!!@sportsandcraft @justlurkingmel @trailblazers That being said if it is only a small hole caused by a fracture rib he is most definitely going to be back soon.@sportsandcraft @justlurkingmel @trailblazers Pneumothorax has a very wide range of recovery time. Like I said odds are they caught it early but if the hole that is leaking air is big surgery or a tube is needed and in the rare case it’s that critical surgery might be needed. My guess is they caught it and he’ll be back soonPortland Trail Blazers vs. Golden State Warriors - 12/8/2021 Free Pick &amp; NBA Betting Prediction https://t.co/GfF86m9SEA

Get Ben Simmons

Trade CJ, Simons, Covington, one 1st round pick and a dozen Voodoo Donuts@jordanmckeown__ @ShamsCharania @trailblazers Never said he wouldn’t. Wasn’t talking about him.Been thinking about how terrible the Mavs social media is

This kinda quickly sums it up

Look how @memgrizz and @trailblazers engage with real people

And the Mavs... only engage with "verified" account types https://t.co/yFDE3761CL@JackFritzWIP @trailblazers 🗣Speak it into existence 😁Just heard the news of Portland Trail Blazers SG CJ McCollum @CJMcCollum . MST wants to wish him a speedy recovery. We love sports but nothing matters more than the health of the players.@jordanmckeown__ @go38831792 @ShamsCharania @trailblazers when he will come back to honestly?@jordanmckeown__ @ShamsCharania @trailblazers From a Sixer fan……that a deal!Look, the @trailblazers can’t trade @Dame_Lillard, no matter what it costs. 

Walton, Drexler, Roy. None of our franchise talents have a lasting legacy with the franchise. We have a guy who wants to have that. 

His value extends way beyond his prime playing window.@CJMcCollum Get back healthy. Never gonna forget Game 7 in Denver, top 5 memory as a @trailblazers fan. CJ CJ CJ🎤 Back on NBA coverage tomorrow night following a 3 week absence. I'm on the @trailblazers vs. @warriors game at 10 PM (ET) / 7 PM (PT), following Bucks 🆚 Heat.

See ya then!

#RipCity x #DubNationSpread for tomorrow night’s Trail Blazers @ Warriors game opens at GSW -14(!). Portland will be without both Damian Lillard and C.J. McCollum.@DannyMarang at this point is it in the best interest for the @trailblazers to just shut down for the season and aquire assets through trades.#breaking CJ McCollum Portland Trail Blazers guard CJ McCollum out after CT scan reveals ...,CJ McCollum injury update: Trail Blazers guard diagnosed with a ...

A few days in the hospital after a crazy painful tube jammed thru the ribs to help the lung heal/re-inflate. Took it easy for a few weeks (non-NBA life of course).
