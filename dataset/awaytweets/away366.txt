But if they win it's the logo and trophy.INBOX:  Ayo Dosunmu is returning to State Farm Center for the Illini's game against Maryland to see his jersey join 33 others that currently hang above Lou Henson Court.

When the Chicago Bulls hit their "three-peat," the  merch about the Bulls' three-peat had to pay royalties to the Lakers Coach who first claimed the trademark, even though it wasn't even clear he coined the term.To be fair, Ayo is actually better than Coby White ever was.  Coby White was legitimately one of the worst players in the NBA and Bulls fans and the Chicago media pretended he was a budding star because he went on like a 3 game hot streak before COVID shut down the NBA.@Ramina1690 The NBA is better when the Bulls are good. NY market is split, so is LA even though it’s mostly a Lakers town. Chicago is one of the biggest single team markets in the NBA. it’s a football town but man do we love our Bulls.I’m available @chicagobulls

He may not have the athleticism he once had but he’s a still a very valuable player to anybody, and he wants to play for Chicago in his hometown

Lol@JermaineHorton @chicagobulls @imanshumpert Im talking about the COVID exemption you’re talking about something totally different.

He’s still a good player and still a good defender with some size. He’s also has a ring and would be good for some of our young guys like Ayo and PWill.

Hope Coby leaves and torches the Bulls for 30. because he's been hurt you forget how he is a fire scorer. The disrespect smh tell me when ayo gets 30 off the bench 3 consecutive games like Coby did as a 19 year oldMy only hope of sanity #ChicagoBulls https://t.co/SLyTJQvftNcmon bring it full circle @JCrossover @chicagobulls https://t.co/N1Ccqgt2LkI’m ready @chicagobulls https://t.co/QvU8PPHTbU@chicagobulls I get off at 5 hml https://t.co/EUMrIcnb6d@rustymarcum @chicagobulls Don’t sleep on Batman, Bulls👆@chicagobulls Mayun if ayo gets covid or an injury I will literally hang myself 😫Lonzo Ball's stats don't really speak to his impact on the Chicago Bulls, but with DeMar DeRozan sidelined, we may see Zo's numbers rise: https://t.co/kZWO7uMC1a #fantasybasketball #nba #dfs #nfs https://t.co/EgaHcBuhiH@Keith_Bullss @Shisnoh @chicagobulls Yup prob means he didn’t return 2 neggys in time 😔@Akaspartan_ @chicagobulls SpartanK@_LC51_ @khaz_19 @chicagobulls Billy’s teeth clampin da gum harder than Caruso b clampin every guy on the court@ChiSportsSam Definitely a good question. I would have to say yes but I must admit Williams can also be the centerpiece of a trade package if Chicago wanted to go that route as well. Which I think drives up his overall value for me. I still absolutely love Ayo tho and glad he's a Bull.@Akaspartan_ @chicagobulls Make play offs to get 1st rnded@josephcwhite @chicagobulls Above average at everything, but not amazing at any one thing flies under scouts radars, they just saw no wow factor, same reason why jokic was a second rounder.

Brooklyn has lost to the Golden State Warriors, Phoenix Suns, &amp; Chicago Bulls recently but defeated Luka Doncic, Kristaps Porzingis &amp; the Dallas Mavs #NBA #MFFL  #NBA75  #DubNation   #NBATwitter@Stacey21King Yes da Chicago bulls all they do is winStill blows my mind that the Chicago Bulls are top 5 in power rankings.I think the @chicagobulls can beat any team in a playoff series in the East except maybe the @Bucks. Sorry @BrooklynNets, you ain't on our level.@MattBrooksNBA @NetsDaily No someone else did earlier in the year think it was the bulls game in chicago@GrasslandFund @_josh_krueger @jacobinfante24 Shit ownership is running the @ChicagoBears 

Let’s go @chicagobulls@DaBabyBurner69 @Christi21344962 @boardz2k1 @chicagobulls @NBA2K You’re on your own buzz😅Dear @Dsabonis11,
Please come to the @chicagobulls, we are one piece away from a #Championship.And Now, Your Chicago Bulls: A 30-Year Celebration | https://t.co/VQ54RIdwQ2 https://t.co/JR16gH1cgXClarence Gaines, Jr. Son of the late legendary Hall of Fame Coach  “ Bighouse” Gaines.  He shares his story as part of The Chicago Bulls 6 NBA titles during the 1990’s. You don’t want to miss his story of Blazing Trials in Business, Sports and Life! https://t.co/9NJgBlXTxv@boardz2k1 @chicagobulls @NBA2K Nahh, he ain't that good, 84 is tops tho, he def deserve a 83, his stats don't show his all around impact on the court@Bishop_PastorRW @chicagobulls I don’t think the Pacers would go for that@chicagobulls @TheRea1DJones Bulls win? I think you could've said it one more time....@ShamsCharania @bkravitz @TheAthletic Here’s an easy winner. Make it happen @chicagobulls https://t.co/VA6qmEQqZk@chicagobulls @DennisPascual40 @ZachLaVine TEARS OF THE BOVINES. 
Do the bulls get a cut of the loot?  (to put toward the freedom of themselves and their cows) Or will man remain ignorant and continue to rape and murder conscious sentient beings?  Life on a Tragic Kingdom Hell of an Earth.

cc: @NBA @MercyForAnimalsNice to see the @chicagobulls back near the top of this list https://t.co/2ygkaO1R7SMiles Turner is a guy that would be a awesome fit at Power Forward for the #Bulls. Chicago has a few trade assets but it could be hard to make this deal work. But I will NEVER count AK &amp; Marc Eversley out of any possibility. I feel a PF/C will be added by the Feb Trade Deadline. https://t.co/Vy2A1QgI5d@CarsonO00370878 @ZackM66 @AyoDos_11 @chicagobulls Man I said that months ago and now look where we are, one of the top teams in the league since Markkanen left, definitely hope the door hit his ass on the way out@dustyrose_NFT You're combining a few of my favorite things - art, babes and the Chicago Bulls! 🔥🏀@chicagobulls @TheRea1DJones @UnitedCenter DJ needs to frame this one@wiseconnector Watch the Chicago bulls@2gunsD @chicagobulls We needed it. LOLWinning takes time. Contenders aren’t built over night. You need to develop young talent alongside your veteran stars or you’ll end up like the Lakers. 

Trading Coby White and Patrick Williams right now does not benefit the Chicago Bulls long-term.

Meanwhile, Scottie Pippen only made $2.3 million and $2.8 million. The small forward was underpaid his entire Bulls career. Mike felt Scottie should have been paid the same.@arturasfanclub @albator @chicagobulls In that order@arturasfanclub @NoahBrasos @albator @chicagobulls This is money!@chicagobulls don't listen to these plebs talking about fit and draft capital.

Both sides of the trade have to agree? Bc I was thinking the @chicagobulls do a 3-team w Denver and Philly and we will give up Cony White and a 1st for Embiid &amp; Joker. I just don’t see why Denver and Philly wouldn’t agree to that?? Crazy!@chicagobulls @NBA2K Ronnie has a job after literally falsely advertising NBA2k20 and there wasn’t compensation for that not even free vc.
