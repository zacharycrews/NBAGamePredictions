Lavine ruled out tonight with back injury, but Derozan should still get the job done. This pacers team is down bad with injuries. Myles Turner still out and now no Sabonis.

#sportsTHA CHICAGO BULLS NEED TO GIVE MATT THOMAS MORE MINUTES. HE’S A SHARP SHOOTER. @chicagobulls@Bulls_Peck Do you think he could be a good fit in Chicago or not? Assuming that some how AK &amp; Eversley would not have to trade Patt Williams to land him. 

I think Randle fits the role and wants to join a winning squad, but might not want that 4th option role. Similar to the Grant situation https://t.co/S17QUCNRnSChicago and New York. Two huge cities. Both Democrat strongholds. Both have some of the highest crime and murder rates in America. Their plan to fix it?
More Democrat bull shit. Because that has worked so well so far.Toronto Raptors tame Chicago Bulls, 127-120 in overtime action! 

Og Anunoby, Scottie Barnes and Fred VanVleet go for 21 points each in the win while Pascal Siakam scored a team-high 25; points! 🔥

Could’ve gone either way. GG.@Graham_JB @chicagobulls That would be the hawks. But yoir hottest team just ran into ANOTHER depleted team@nategodlewski87 @Real_JOF @BullsBetter @chicagobulls if we can get that, I'd be all for it.  Not a huge fan of Schroder, but at least while we have guys out we need another consistent bench guy@2KEW13 @chicagobulls You ran into the hottest team in the league. It happens 🤷🏾‍♂️#NBAnaBand

He can’t even guard a fucking chair. He makes terrible plays all around. If I didn’t know better, he looks more of a rookie than Ayo.@BillyClosset @chicagobulls Yeah and maybe we might get a bench by then@chicagobulls This was our best defensive game since Zo and Caruso were both healthy. If we keep up the pace and play defense like this we'll be fine until our other guys get back. We just can't fall asleep like that at the final stretch again. A growing pain we should be past by now.@RadFinch @chicagobulls I was kidding about trolling part. I don't do that, but some fans do. This is your year my friend, to take it all.@chicagobulls the Bulls are a long ways from winning a championship.

You then trade TBJ and a 2nd for Schroder to replace Coby with his scoring. Then sign Millsap if he gets bought out, or trade Thomas for Millsap straight upToronto Raptors tame Chicago Bulls, 127-120 in overtime action!

Lol@chicagobulls You guys suck (except demar &lt;3)@OGsJumper @DeVineBall @chicagobulls exactly. Its like the pistons can win a playoff series against the bulls.

You can’t be making excuses.. we’ve been injured the whole season and still top of the east@godzmic @chicagobulls It wouldn’t matter much if he went big.

4 assists.
A steal and a block.@DeVineBall @OGsJumper @chicagobulls Let em celebrate when we have Zo AC DJJ and Pat out@Cubs1617 @chicagobulls Idk man…. Ayo was selling in terms of scoring the basketball. Coby was def gettin his buckets from outside the line….😵The @Raptors just beat the @MiamiHEAT twice and now the @chicagobulls.  Respect!@chicagobulls INDY TMR LFG LETS GO BULLS! 🔴🔴@Ge52891808 @chicagobulls So would you rather trade for a worthless big man and keep coby, or would you rather trade coby for a big man, replace him with Schroder’s scoring who had his best years under Donovan. Schroder is also a better defender@lokibucky3 @chicagobulls All good he’ll learn from it 🙏@chicagobulls Does Demar normally not pass it to zack in the 4th qtr?LIVE: Coach Billy Donovan media availability following tonight’s game against the Raptors https://t.co/nTPjyeNE8S@DeVineBall @chicagobulls nah bruh we missing dragic 💀💀💀@KiraDz18 @neilfunkfan100 @disgame21 @chicagobulls Which is a big problem but knowing he's hurt right now that's a bigger problem with these games comin up@chicagobulls Bro billy needs to quit with matt and troy on the floor.. especially at the same time. Play mckinnie or malcolm or something@GlanvilleCaleb @CHICAGO_1996_ @chicagobulls It felt like he had no call to be honest. First off why when the game is tied are we all flocking to the 3 point line? Second where was the screen? Not one screen for any player@JetJaguar74 @chicagobulls Are u aware that we have our four best defenders out? We don’t need that much defense. Just one big that can protect the rim and get rebounds.@Real_JOF @soni_maxx @BullsBetter @chicagobulls He was cut yet, but he’s expected to be@Cubs1617 @chicagobulls Lmao as a raptors fan I do not miss Matt Thomas defense he does the same thing everytime🔴🏀 BULLS LOSE IN OT 🏀🔴

@chicagobulls fall to @Raptors I'm OT

So close for Bulls but just couldn't get over the line

#UKBullsFB #BullsNation https://t.co/gW725ben87@chicagobulls We need a little help before the deadline@chicagobulls Goodnight https://t.co/GlgTpLGTMT@SlimysznJl @GeorgeV_17 @chicagobulls That quick pass to Lavine that got stolen is what ultimately did it, yeah I agree@GeorgeV_17 @SoxInTheCity7 @chicagobulls Your pfp is why we lost that game terrible defenceBulls Lose...

Chicago Bulls - 120
Toronto Raptors - 127

(32-20)

#BullsNation https://t.co/bwQ6jqbST3@Cubs1617 @chicagobulls Bro Matt Thomas worked hard, kept moving on offence and grabbed some boards - he is honestly a decent piece for another team. When we’re the best 3pt% team tho he obvs ain’t what we need, so agreed ship him and agree w coby too@chicagobulls Y’all got a losing record against all the top east and west teams….. y’all about to be in the play in, in the next couple weeks@gmo_prince @chicagobulls This you? https://t.co/rPuAjeLybo@chicagobulls Can 6-8 weeks go any faster@chicagobulls Bulls really need to make some moves soon and bring in a PF and centre. We really need some bigs on this team. Too many guards. We are losing games because we’re getting out rebounded and beat in the paint every time because we’re too fucking small. Plus the defence sucks!What a game! #Raptors over the Chicago Bulls 127 - 120 in overtime. 

- the Bulls are #1 in the East
- with the addition os Khem Birch in the lineup tonight the Raptors were at full strength tonight
-Fred Vandervleet was named as an all-star tonight.
#WeTheNorth@chicagobulls Way to fight despite being undersized #BullsNation@chicagobulls Bulls will win tommorow.@BlinkyBurner @chicagobulls @DeMar_DeRozan That's was a good game. And if the Bulls do play the Raptors in the playoffs, key defenders like @ZO2_ &amp; @ACFresh21 will definitely help down the stretch. #BullsNation@adamsilveralt @chicagobulls @NBCSChicago @DeMar_DeRozan That what cost the game🤷🏽‍♂️@chicagobulls This was a very tough loss@SoxInTheCity7 @chicagobulls And he couldn't grab the most important oneChecking in. @chicagobulls https://t.co/t44OKGGevKI'm out of breath. What a game.
Toronto were solid in defence &amp; the bulls just couldn't get firing. They did in the third quarter &amp; I thought they would get it done, but it wasn't to be.
Still a proud @chicagobulls fan. All the way from across the pond. 
#BullsNation@nategodlewski87 @chicagobulls Schroder doesn't help us at all@soni_maxx @Raptors6Man @chicagobulls You miss spelled the refs did a good job.@adamsilveralt @chicagobulls @NBCSChicago @DeMar_DeRozan Right he shouldn’t help to double team🤷🏽‍♂️@Cubs1617 @chicagobulls You know maybe trading Coby for a big man and then replacing him with Schroder wouldn’t be a bad idea@DeRozanDelivers @chicagobulls Neither do y’all😂@DP0YZO @chicagobulls Checking in. https://t.co/ILJhP3JCcIPhiladelphia - Memphis.

Equates to ONE player on the Bulls getting 14 FTs …@chicagobulls when are we going to play Alfonzo Mckinnie@Cubs1617 @chicagobulls We’ll definitely see a trade before the deadline. Can’t go into the playoffs with Vuc and Tony Bradley as your only 2 bigs, and Bradley is 🗑@eyecposts @chicagobulls YESSIR PEOPLE USING MY MEMES@chicagobulls Couple bad moments down the stretch.@neilfunkfan100 @disgame21 @chicagobulls rookie or not he cannot make tos like that@chicagobulls We could have won this game in so many ways but oh well. This game clearly shows we need a big man that can grab boards. Toronto had 20+ offensive rebounds which is ridiculous. Literally trade Coby for a good big man and trade for Schroder to replace Coby@TwiTati @chicagobulls We have a losing record against them.  Let's be civil lmao@SB4xJG4 @chicagobulls Good game man@missionarymelo @chicagobulls Funny how you say a healthy nets team yet dont acknowledge that the bulls arent healthy either 😂 the whole defense essentially is injured@missionarymelo @chicagobulls no lonzo, caruso, williams, and jones lmk@DeRozanDelivers @chicagobulls Sadly we cannot do that after beating the heat b2b, beating the hawks 7 game winning streak and now the bullsRaptors let the weak-ass Bulls back in the game… Chicago lucky to reach OT . 

 #BullsNation@jguizarra @DeRozanDelivers @Raptors6Man @chicagobulls Enjoy your one win against us@chicagobulls Trade coby for a big please vooch  can't do everything@disgame21 @chicagobulls Ayo is a rookie. He can make those mistakes. I’m a massive Zach fan, just saying that he has a tendency to rush in clutch moments and his handle gets loose, leading to costly turnovers@chicagobulls Turnovers, dumb turnovers everywhere. https://t.co/IPaXpwnCwV@deballzach8 @chicagobulls @NBCSChicago @DeMar_DeRozan Fuck yea he is ….he left dude wide open 🤷🏽‍♂️@chicagobulls Why can't we play proper defense and finish consistently?!?!?! I'm about to pull my hair out!@chicagobulls How yall leave gary trent wide open@Raptors6Man @chicagobulls Weaklings take time to bother doing this.Deflating loss after fighting back in a (scrappy) late 4th quarter effort. 

Ultimately ayos back to back turnovers sealed the tight contest in overtime. 

Road games woes

Toronto plays hard. 
Hoping we don’t see them in the first round come April.

#BullsNation 
@chicagobulls@chicagobulls Wasn’t expecting y’all to win anyways, kick the pacers ass tomorrow@chicagobulls 8.6 seconds@CptFalchion @chicagobulls He's the reason we were in ot just sayin@chicagobulls Donovan blew that. Vuc out 7 minutes straight at the end of the 3rd beginning of the 4th. Your hottest guy and best rebounder. Dumb.@chicagobulls Congrats, you just lost to the sexiest man alive!! https://t.co/3NZvpY3HRP@BillyClosset @chicagobulls He’s a rookie bruh@RaptorsGen @chicagobulls Be humbleThe Toronto Raptors extend their winning streak to 4 games with a thrilling 127-120 in OT against the Chicago Bulls to improve to 27-23. Raptors played excellent defence, forced a lot of turnovers, recorded 58 rebounds &amp; a season high 22 offensive boards. Starters played a lot.@chicagobulls Bulls Defense is completely horrible. I’m calling  out the whole coaching stuff. That’s completely unacceptable. Tha last position when down by 2 they left Trent Junior right open. He was in Island all by himself. Smho!!! Unacceptable. Defense defense defense.@Raptors6Man @chicagobulls Good game man keep grinding. Y’all done a good job.@chicagobulls That’s one of the most frustrating games of the season. Zach shouldn’t have even played@chicagobulls what type of coaching says "we're getting beat on the glass, let's go with a smaller lineup"@SoxInTheCity7 @chicagobulls Bro we wouldn't have been in ot if he could grab a fucking rebound he threw@chicagobulls I CANNOT FATHOM WHAT I JUST SAW, WE TURN THE BALL OVER AFTER FORCING A TURNOVER AND THEN WE LEAVE SOMEONE WIDE OPEN FOR 3 WITH NO ONE IN A 20 FOOT VICINITY?!?!?!?@chicagobulls Thank you Toronto.. Indiana you are next please.@chicagobulls Trade for a big I begI realise that the @chicagobulls are short handed, but to lose in OT hurts!

Not happy!

Our players are lazy and uninspiring and our coaching is laughable. I'm done with this team and will take my fandom to Toronto time to win some games!@chicagobulls Better Luck next time🔥@Raptors6Man @chicagobulls That’s cringe@chicagobulls nah son what were those last 50 seconds 💀@chicagobulls GG bulls fans, great game https://t.co/3Eg2dz2Kui@chicagobulls Nothing but love guys, great game!@chicagobulls Zach needs to rest tomorrow@chicagobulls Unlucky, need to get those rebounds 😭@chicagobulls Love demar but https://t.co/fmjjrvT58r@SoxInTheCity7 @chicagobulls For what? We lost. Have shame@chicagobulls Damn. Ayo finally looked like a rookie during that OT@chicagobulls This game shows how much we need a guy like Jerami Grant@BullsBetter @chicagobulls Even though I like tbj, I think we trade him maybe Matt and a first for a decent return@chicagobulls Lol Get Vuc help with Siakam or somebody man , he has no help…@chicagobulls Pain@neilfunkfan100 @chicagobulls Lmao@chicagobulls You just lost to the splash brothers https://t.co/QXNCAa2SdV@chicagobulls hopefully patrick williams is taking notes on scottie barnes@chicagobulls we supposed to believe that the chicago bulls are a real threat to the bucks, suns, warriors or a healthy nets team? disgusting@chicagobulls All of that to leave Trent Jr wide open for a 3 https://t.co/HrPKrFs7sL@chicagobulls You guys gave me a brain 🧠 bleed 🩸 from yelling@chicagobulls We got it tomorrow@chicagobulls Ggs bulls fans!!!@chicagobulls Matt Thomas was worthless today and we need someone else who can play defense down low and get rebounds. Way too many soft points down low and WAY too many offensive rebounds given up. Coby also being -19 on the court isn’t great!@chicagobulls Rebounding really lost us this game.. unbelievable, next training session better be focusing on rebounds, something you learn when your fucking 10 years old #Bulls@chicagobulls Vooch’s amazing night was wasted 😭 Gave up way too many offensive rebounds… we can’t leave shooters open like that, how are we going to leave red hot Gary Trent Jr wide open #BullsNation@chicagobulls Unreal choke.@chicagobulls man this one sucks@chicagobulls Yessir@chicagobulls Ppl so loud about Vuc’s struggles but he’s literally averaging 20ppg over the last 9 games, &amp; just put up a 30 &amp; 20 game. Meanwhile nobody talks about Zach always dribbling the ball off his foot/turning the ball over in crunch time. LOVE both guys but the criticisms gotta be fair@chicagobulls Pain@chicagobulls WE. HAVE. NO. DEFENSE. https://t.co/hvA0G7SuiS@chicagobulls Watching this team play defense makes my eyes bleedDaaaamn!
Did @NikolaVucevic just win it for the bulls.
