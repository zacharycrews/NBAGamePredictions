Bulls coming off a big win face a tough team in Miami. Miami is 3-0 against the Bulls winning by 13/26/3. Miami trying to lock up #1, should be a full effort.

#LEGENDoftheMiamiHEAT #NBA75@MiamiHEAT Keep it going CoachPLEASE PLEASE beat the Bulls tmrw @MiamiHEATThe Miami Heat follow me and they’ve won 3 World Championships, the @FlaPanthers don’t follow me and they haven’t won any. I’m just saying.@MiamiHEAT started season tickets 3 games late. Went to last 38 home games. Got cheated out of playoff tickets because we are considered “partial plan”.  Not cool!  Not white hot!!!😡🤬@AdamJTurke @celtics @jaytatum0 In Lunch: Food for the Miami Heat https://t.co/dqu3wBsgJaRaptors final five games: Miami, Atlanta, Philly, Houston, Knicks. Feels like about a 3-2. Means Bulls would have to match it against the Heat, Bucks, Boston, Charlotte and Minnesota to keep the fifth spot because of the tie-breaker. Forget the play-in ... was never reality.@TheHoopCentral FUTURE HEATLE @MiamiHEAT @NBA @WhiteHouse https://t.co/6OaT2YCjMWThe Clippers are doing the Heat a solid tonight. They're blowing out the Bucks who are just a .5 game behind Miami for the 1 seed.single season assists. Played 11 NBA seasons scoring 1,903 points. Currently a tv analyst with the Miami Heat. Bobby Martin chose Pitt out of Atlantic City High School. Three year starter at Pitt and when he left he was the school’s 12th all-time leading scorer with 1,282 points.Nobody ever said or says this about the Warriors or Heat. 

I also guarantee you Milwaukee has better sports fans than Miami. 🤦🏻‍♂️ https://t.co/yguXEEmXW8@MiamiHEAT @therabody Perfect.The Miami Heat come in to Toronto Sunday on a back-to-back… Kyle Lowry might not be playing.  Just say’n.

#TradingCards #ForSale #eBay https://t.co/mgfFYRcjwJ@masonterrasi Don’t call Miami heat a super team wade was declining and not a top 5 player in the league and Chris Bosh wasn’t a top 5 player either@CoopRoss4 @JonBozeka Brandon Goodwin has helped win a few games when Garland and Rondo were absent. Notably the Pelicans game. I call Goodwin, Badloss but I am biased against undersized players. Kyle Guy helped in victory with the Miami Heat when Lowry and others were absent.Chicago Bulls unveil stacked injury report ahead of big matchup vs. Miami Heat: https://t.co/1EeRd9u57xWith the first normal Miami rain of the year, all new yorkers and Californians were standing still on I-95.

Stay out of the kitchen if you can't stand the heat.

Not the late 90s. 

Not Wade’s rookie year or ‘06 title. 

Not the Big 3 era.

Not the bubble. 

THIS is Eric Reid’s favorite season he’s been part of with the @MiamiHEAT.
