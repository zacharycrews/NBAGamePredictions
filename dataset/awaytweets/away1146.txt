@sixers are obviously the better team, but the @DetroitPistons have been a gritty ATS this season.

@cavs are missing Mobley and Allen for this one, those are two very important pieces, I take @ATLHawks to cover.Today we go against the @cavs in ATL!

We look to win the season series 3-1.

Against the Cavs:

Trae Young: 33.3 PTS | 9 AST | 1.7 STL

Wow I’m really astonishd rn. You super casual if you think Kidd that made the Mavs top 5 in defense is terrible@FromTexasYall @victorrmtx @SpyrosVel @cavs @dariusgarland22 @luka7doncic Notice how Ja Morant doesn’t bitch every off season to the Griz FO because the Griz FO doesn’t do stupid stuff like the Mavs FO does to even force Ja to have to speak up.@FromTexasYall @victorrmtx @SpyrosVel @cavs @dariusgarland22 @luka7doncic No the fact that you were even in the position in the first place is the dysfunctional part. The damage control afterwards is irrelevant. My point was Luka bitches almost every off-season. Which in this case.. he did.The @cavs are on the verge of making the playoffs w/o LeBron for the 1st time since ‘98 and it’s thanks in large part to Evan Mobley

Wasn’t Spoelstra close to getting fired when LeBron was on the Heat? This doesn’t mean nothing lmao@MTownMade @victorrmtx @SpyrosVel @cavs @dariusgarland22 @luka7doncic Yeah that’s exactly why they got rid of the coach Luka hated and involved him in the interview process to hire the coach and traded away a 7’3 shooting guard to get another ball handler to help take the pressure off. But you know the media always right I guess@victorrmtx @SpyrosVel @cavs @dariusgarland22 @luka7doncic And you’ve literally watched a couple games of Ja to make this assertion. I’ve watched every single Ja game he’s played. Dude is a playmaker. But that’s irrelevant Ja is clearly the better player and literally only YOU thinks otherwise.Since everyone has #hindsight vision…The Cleveland Cavaliers would’ve won the 2015 championship if Kelly O didn’t pull @kevinebest arm off #NBA@FromTexasYall @victorrmtx @SpyrosVel @cavs @dariusgarland22 @luka7doncic Jason Kidd had Giannis and still got fired lmaoooooo@MTownMade @SpyrosVel @cavs @dariusgarland22 @luka7doncic ja not a playmaker wtf you on bro 😂😂 you don’t know ball. DG’s entire team has been injured for the past month but they were fighting for the 1 seed a couple weeks ago. Ja’s team is good, they play better without him. That’s not what an elite playmaker does. 19-2 without him.@FromTexasYall @victorrmtx @SpyrosVel @cavs @dariusgarland22 @luka7doncic Well it basically says the Mavs FO sucks and Luka was pissed because the FO sucks basically everything I’ve been saying this whole time.@victorrmtx @SpyrosVel @cavs @dariusgarland22 @luka7doncic Ja is an amazing playmaker wtf are you saying? Ja literally elevated the second worst team in the NBA to the play-in last season. Tha Cavs on the verge of missing the playoffs this season while Memphis #2.

Garland is a better shooter too. Ja plays the game like a younger westbrook or rose did. High energy explosive mediocre shooter but great at the rim. I’m personally taking Garland. Hype aside he’ll be better.@FromTexasYall @victorrmtx @SpyrosVel @cavs @dariusgarland22 @luka7doncic So you’re saying the Knicks would beat the Mavs in a 7 game series then, right? + I’d hope a guy in his SEVENTH year could outplay a sophomore you’ve set the bar hella low for a washed Dinwiddie.. and there is a reason why Kidd ain’t on anyones COTY short list.@CLETalkingHeads I'm not done with the @cavs but extremely frustrated with the injuries.

Fuck injuries they ruined our perfect season@DevaronPerry @cavs Amen.@cavs Please take Cedi out of the dog house, wtf are we doing?Bickerstaff: @luka7doncic "doesn't allow you to speed him up...he's a wizard with that ball in his hands"
@cavs @cleveland19news@CLEsportsTalk @Cavs_Mania @cavs @CavsNationCP @923TheFan I said it a week ago and I will re-emphasize it. Injuries have taken their toll we will not even make the play in tournament unless other teams lose. Just horrible. Between the Browns and the Cavs and the injuries #SMFHDallas Mavericks @ Cleveland Cavaliers Four Factors (03/30/2022)

Via Cleaning the Glass https://t.co/7DmboPVJ27Regardless how this @Cavs season turns out, I’m extremely proud of the players, coaches and front office staff for the job they’ve done this year. The future is very bright in Cleveland.@mavsncowboys @cavs Cleveland is home to one of the largest Slovenian populations in the U.S. He has fans here. Not a big fan of the 'foul merchant' play style, though. Wish he would focus more on legitimate good basketball, because he doesn't have to play like Embiid &amp; Harden to do well.@Doggyboyy4 @cavs Ohh windshit guy is here@jeffwltrs @MrStark_42 @DevaronPerry @cediosman @cavs I think because of injuries he lucked into what works with the @cavs and then when he got nervous, he panicked and went back to last year.

 I am not sure, that JB understands what he has with this Team, they need someone who is going to press their advantage

  #GoCavs@216kobraEli @schulz_EvanCP @cavs Windler though?The Washington wizards and Cleveland cavaliers have the same head coach... https://t.co/ufkBpVrc7hLove my @cavs ❤️🏀. Learn from this as it will only make you stronger. You know what you are capable of as you proved it all season. Keep fighting!@cavs what the fuck@cavs You choose windshit over Cedi so you deserved thisThe Dallas Mavericks end March with a 120-112 win against the Cleveland Cavaliers. Luka Doncic led with 35 points, 9 rebounds, and 13 assists.

In March, the Mavericks finished with a 12-4 record with Doncic posting averages of 29.9 points, 9.2 rebounds, and 7.8 assists.@cavs You guys just fell@cavs I do t like how JB’s been coaching this stretch.@cavs Injuries define a season and unfortunately it’s at the worst time of the year .Final. 

Caris went off tonight, but it wasn’t quite enough to get the win. 

Moral of the story, we need to get healthy. 

#LetEmKnow #Cavs #CavsNation #CavsTwitter #Cleveland #Cavaliers https://t.co/UsEAUCsvdaUgh @Cavs Played Hard!!!Have fun dealing with KD and Kyrie @cavs@KyrieSwerving02 @cavs Seriously, that and Okoro scored 2 points in 32 minutes. 💀Closing Time @Raptors !!

 JB is tensing up and a young team can sense that.

  He needs to go back to what got the @cavs here in the first place.

Date : 3/30/2022 - Time : 7pOf course @cavs with another game with 15 plus turnovers. #LetEmKnow@cavs JB Bickerstaff it is mind boggling you are allowing Lamar Stevens and Windler to make constant mistakes without letting Cedi Osman play. What is the real story? Fans want to know. @MunchCleveland @terrypluto@KxnGary @cavs @CarisLeVert @dariusgarland22 Lol 1 good game per month should satisfy your mob 🤣I mean seriously @cavs how in the fuck does Kevin Love with 3-10 FG and less rebounds get more play time than Moses Brown? Garbage#Cavs Damn man they want it more! No rim protection! We need more jacked players or than just stevens @cavs we softTurning point in this game was midway in the third. Two straight turnovers turned into Mavs going up by 6 or 8 and @cavs haven’t been the same since. Look mentally and emotionally EXHAUSTED.cLeveLand cavaLiers olduk@cavs Why did JB sit Moses? Moses was doing well and we had the lead. I don’t understand JB’s substitutions.Proud to honor the service and sacrifice of another pair of hometown heroes tonight with @CrownRoyal!

Thank you for your service, Sergeant First Class Joseph Fought and Elizabeth Fought ❤️💙 https://t.co/vlzuo5Iqj5GG’s @cavs smh@cavs 2nd half collapse 😭😭😭@cavs He hasn't even tried to shoot once in 11 minutes. give half of his minutes to Cedi, he may not score but will try at least@wasted_voter @cavs Agree.@KyrieSwerving02 @cavs Isaac is over rated. Okoro is supposed to be the defensive guru, he’s terrible.. He hasn’t stopped anyone on the Mavs team.What the fuck was the reasoning for the @cavs not play Moses brown the entire 4th fucking quarter@cavs I still don't understand what Windler is good for.If the @Raptors win and the @cavs lose, they will be 2 GB ahead of them, and y'all thinking that @evanmobley will be ROTY instead of @Scottbarnes561? He has a  injury that will miss him some games.@lfcshon @cavs Easily…turnovers and missed shots.Where in the flying flip is @cediosman? Huh? Where IS HE? @cavs getting asses kicked and we play Windler over Osman for ENTIRE flipping game?  @luka7doncic is a damned FREAK! So much better than Bird at this point in career.  @markcuban should sign this dude to lifetime contract!Midway thru Q4 ... #DalVsCle 

Looking like @memgrizz will have to win it outright --- thanks @cavs

Thats whyAnd when @cavs finally coerce a miss from the Mavs, they don’t get a rebound and Dallas scores anyway. Happened a lot all season. Feels like Mavs have scored on 80% of their trips down the floor. Not good. Not good at all.Players seem to have the best game of the season against the @cavs man.

Bet slip link: https://t.co/xV8M8MTyw6 https://t.co/sDEUseLYf3The @cavs are the only team from Cleveland that brings me joy right now #LetEmKnow https://t.co/AN5RmjEJax@TinaSha12255108 @cavs No one said max him out but I’m okay with him taking the role and minutes that Ed Davis or Kevin Pangos got this year.@cavs @CarisLeVert @dariusgarland22 No sexton
No rondo
No j.allen
No Dean wade
No mobley
So what happened to Cedi? Why still doesn't he play?
No more watching cavs.@cavs @dariusgarland22 Can't wait to have @evanmobley and @_bigjayy_  out there too. This team is special.@DevaronPerry @cavs Lmao no the hell he ain’t@cavs @CarisLeVert Cavs “fans” told me he was trash 💀Easily Caris LeVert’s best game since being with the @cavs about time!!!!!@cavs @CarisLeVert This is the game we needed from lavert 💪🏼@TinaSha12255108 @cavs For a backup big to develop off the bench? Nah he’s worth the same type of multi year deal that Dean Wade and Lamar got. All they needed was an opportunity and they took advantage.@cavs @CarisLeVert Moses brown is getting fucking exposed 💀@cavs @CarisLeVert @dariusgarland22 The second Luka came back in we fell apart lmao sadSilky smooth 🔥
