@sixers are obviously the better team, but the @DetroitPistons have been a gritty ATS this season.

@cavs are missing Mobley and Allen for this one, those are two very important pieces, I take @ATLHawks to cover.Today we go against the @cavs in ATL!

We look to win the season series 3-1.

Against the Cavs:

Trae Young: 33.3 PTS | 9 AST | 1.7 STL

He‚Äôs a skinnier version of Zion@cavs  @jbbickerstaff_  do we want to win? With all the injury‚Äôs we are fighting threw.

Injuries have taken their toll we will not even make the play in tournament unless other teams lose. Just horrible. Between the Browns and the Cavs and the injuries #SMFHDallas Mavericks @ Cleveland Cavaliers Four Factors (03/30/2022)

Via Cleaning the Glass https://t.co/7DmboPVJ27Regardless how this @Cavs season turns out, I‚Äôm extremely proud of the players, coaches and front office staff for the job they‚Äôve done this year. The future is very bright in Cleveland.@mavsncowboys @cavs Cleveland is home to one of the largest Slovenian populations in the U.S. He has fans here. Not a big fan of the 'foul merchant' play style, though. Wish he would focus more on legitimate good basketball, because he doesn't have to play like Embiid &amp; Harden to do well.@Doggyboyy4 @cavs Ohh windshit guy is here@jeffwltrs @MrStark_42 @DevaronPerry @cediosman @cavs I think because of injuries he lucked into what works with the @cavs and then when he got nervous, he panicked and went back to last year.

 I am not sure, that JB understands what he has with this Team, they need someone who is going to press their advantage

  #GoCavs@216kobraEli @schulz_EvanCP @cavs Windler though?The Washington wizards and Cleveland cavaliers have the same head coach... https://t.co/ufkBpVrc7hLove my @cavs ‚ù§Ô∏èüèÄ. Learn from this as it will only make you stronger. You know what you are capable of as you proved it all season. Keep fighting!@cavs what the fuck@cavs You choose windshit over Cedi so you deserved thisThe Dallas Mavericks end March with a 120-112 win against the Cleveland Cavaliers. Luka Doncic led with 35 points, 9 rebounds, and 13 assists.

In March, the Mavericks finished with a 12-4 record with Doncic posting averages of 29.9 points, 9.2 rebounds, and 7.8 assists.@cavs You guys just fell@cavs I do t like how JB‚Äôs been coaching this stretch.@cavs Injuries define a season and unfortunately it‚Äôs at the worst time of the year .Final. 

Caris went off tonight, but it wasn‚Äôt quite enough to get the win. 

Moral of the story, we need to get healthy.
