@OrlandoMagic https://t.co/ZPkTyZKQYR@NBASarah I remember when the Orlando Magic fired Doc Rivers on an 0-7 start after he'd taken them to the playoffs for -- and here's where it gets fuzzy -- five straight seasons of his tenure? And now he's on the list of the 15 greatest coaches in NBA history. What a weird business.Possibly lost in the NBA trades of the day is that the short-handed Trail Blazers play the Orlando Magic tonight.

That's the Magic for you :)To my friends, family &amp; followers in Orlando, I want to thank you for making my 24 yrs here the most rewarding of my life. I turned down numerous chances to leave b/c I love Orlando &amp; its people. From afar, I’ll be cheering on the @OrlandoMagic, @UCF_Football &amp; @wshsbearsvballThe Portland @trailblazers take on the Orlando Magic tonight at 6:30 PM PT on ROOT SPORTS 🏀 https://t.co/oJwdHACRWjThis could be worse. We could be Orlando Magic fans 😂😂😂What are the Orlando Magic waiting for? Their fire sale should’ve started a month agoTeams you shouldn’t get drafted to : 
Orlando Magic 
Sacremento Kings@trailblazers @OrlandoMagic @ModaCenter @ROOTSPORTS_NW @RipCityRadio620 WTH. Why trading CJ, an all star caliber player, for nothing, none of this player can be all star and can help to be a contender. Should have tried to have Ben Simmons or Sabonis.
Even the Norm move is stupid.Get on the phones @OrlandoMagic we got T.Ross &amp; Gary Harris sitting right there ready to go to LA. https://t.co/uAVzluY92X@BaldheadSlyck been thinking about this more &amp; more with the Kings. it's big as a joke as Oklahoma having a team. no one wants to go &amp; play in those cities/franchises. they're the Orlando Magic of the West.As long as I’m alive the Orlando Magic, the Sacramento Kings, and Minnesota Timberwolves will never win a championship ring@Ben66Miller @GaryGoatJr @eaglesnicky @trailblazers @OrlandoMagic @ModaCenter @ROOTSPORTS_NW @RipCityRadio620 This is where I sit with it. We’ve been fairly mediocre recently and needed some kind of mix up. Idk why when it actually happens people have this expectation like us trading CJ was going to get us Lebron or something. Happily awaiting next seasons and optimistic2/8/18 – 15min before the trade deadline, the Phoenix #Suns traded a 2018 2nd Rd pick (Jarred Vanderbilt) to the Orlando Magic for PG Elfrid Payton, waving Isaiah Canaan (fractured Ankle) to make space. Payton was avg'ing 13.0p/6.3a/4.0r for ORL prior to the trade. #ValleyProud https://t.co/sDO3EijVc2@iHoosier4 @trailblazers @OrlandoMagic @ModaCenter @ROOTSPORTS_NW @RipCityRadio620 This is probably the last move for us this season. This trade achieved two things. It's giving us almost 60 mil in cap room going into the offseason, and created a 21 mil trade exception. Totally agree though. This season has been ROUGH.Consensus Line Move:
2022-02-08 Orlando Magic at Portland Trail Blazers from 1.50 to -1.00

Some team will receive a few things from the Magic while Orlando probably gets nothing.

Full trade:

Orlando - 🤷‍♂️

Any team - 🤦‍♂️@wojespn Hey @wojespn do you expect the orlando magic to be active ?@trailblazers @OrlandoMagic @ModaCenter @ROOTSPORTS_NW @RipCityRadio620 I cant believe that blazers tarded their second best player! but its fine we going to build this team. we will be 82:0 team soon.@FCP_ERJ @Pacers @Lakers @OrlandoMagic this is actually the worst trade ive ever seen never watch basketball again@sullymygoodname Buddy and I had this chat recently. Sacramento Kings. Orlando Magic. Arizona Diamondbacks.@trailblazers @OrlandoMagic @ModaCenter @ROOTSPORTS_NW @RipCityRadio620 Why yall trade Cj😭Thanking God Himself today because my Orlando Magic dodged the Domantas Sabonis Trade bullet🙏🏼@minicooper014 @eaglesnicky @trailblazers @OrlandoMagic @ModaCenter @ROOTSPORTS_NW @RipCityRadio620 Portland gets it if it’s 5-14. If NO wins the lottery or makes the playoffs, Portland gets a future first.@OrlandoMagic @FieldsAuto @jalensuggs @thats_G_ Shoe wear🔥🔥@Ben66Miller @eaglesnicky @trailblazers @OrlandoMagic @ModaCenter @ROOTSPORTS_NW @RipCityRadio620 isn’t it protectedMagic happens when you don't give up.

Love that Orlando Magic unis. https://t.co/A0df6wqCcA@moelaarag0 @eaglesnicky @trailblazers @OrlandoMagic @ModaCenter @ROOTSPORTS_NW @RipCityRadio620 They’re a play in team now, and the pick still sits at 9. Maybe it jumps to 12, but I don’t see them moving into the top 6 of the west. And who know if Zion plays and what he looks like if he does.@universaIfriend @Lakers @trailblazers @OrlandoMagic If in SG, and Lillard in PG for Lillard/Nunn Monk/Bradley, I prefer clearing THT 🧨@6ertified_ @KysonM1 @trailblazers @OrlandoMagic @ModaCenter @ROOTSPORTS_NW @RipCityRadio620 Only like 3 teams will have cap space this summer. There won’t be options to go to destination franchises. Also, trades.Portland is collapsing and the Moose is ready to pounce

Hit a home run on one of those picks (or trade for someone established), and they could be really good quickly.

Huge risk in all of this. But isn’t risk what Portland fans have screamed for?@BurnerOfNba @PhoenixGolf55 @Brayden_W11 @trailblazers @OrlandoMagic @ModaCenter @ROOTSPORTS_NW @RipCityRadio620 I mean aye we got cap now and who don’t wanna play next to dame 😏 even tho FA ain’t gonna be the best but aye fuck it https://t.co/pMkmcUR15n@CityMadeGoat @PhoenixGolf55 @Brayden_W11 @trailblazers @OrlandoMagic @ModaCenter @ROOTSPORTS_NW @RipCityRadio620 He tryna stay loyal which is his decision but he needs to understand that portland ain't winning a chip for at least next 10 years@clamaslb @OrlandoMagic The first one makes no sense for the Magic. Hield doesn't fit the timeline an taking on his contract then takes away from our cap flexibility. Also no chance we give up an expiring contract and that Bulls 1st round pick for thatHearing the Sixers are close to a deal with the Orlando Magic to acquire PG Markelle Fultz in exchange for Ben Simmons. Morey on the phone with the Magic trying to get a deal done as soon as this evening.@trailblazers @OrlandoMagic @ModaCenter @ROOTSPORTS_NW @RipCityRadio620 Pull the trigger you get so many young pieces https://t.co/q4k2MaVa5O@BurnerOfNba @PhoenixGolf55 @Brayden_W11 @trailblazers @OrlandoMagic @ModaCenter @ROOTSPORTS_NW @RipCityRadio620 Bro Fa and shit why would you go out your way and trade a dame lillard if he don’t wanna be traded yet he obviously knows/sees something we don’t in that team and staff but no reason to trade him if he wanna still be there now if wanted to be traded then yes@OrlandoMagic @MagicTime32 Opiniones?@universaIfriend @Lakers @trailblazers @OrlandoMagic I think the right sentence is "Send Brodie off to Orlando Magic WITH picks"Mis trades REALISTAS (creo) para @OrlandoMagic , a esto sumarle 1 o 2 trades por Ross y/o Lopez a cambio de picks.

And he’s mid prime, it’s not like hes 22 with a bunch of room to grow. He’s a borderline top 50 player. He was ranked as the 15th best SF (and probably about the same for SGs).@CityMadeGoat @PhoenixGolf55 @Brayden_W11 @trailblazers @OrlandoMagic @ModaCenter @ROOTSPORTS_NW @RipCityRadio620 SO if blazers are entering a rebuild why are they keeping him use him to get young players/ picks@GaryGoatJr @trailblazers @OrlandoMagic @ModaCenter @ROOTSPORTS_NW @RipCityRadio620 I’d rather not! https://t.co/ugLcqY2Ua3@BurnerOfNba @PhoenixGolf55 @Brayden_W11 @trailblazers @OrlandoMagic @ModaCenter @ROOTSPORTS_NW @RipCityRadio620 Why would you trade him when he don’t want traded@Ben66Miller @KysonM1 @6ertified_ @trailblazers @OrlandoMagic @ModaCenter @ROOTSPORTS_NW @RipCityRadio620 He’s getting to that level.@PhoenixGolf55 @trailblazers @OrlandoMagic @ModaCenter @ROOTSPORTS_NW @RipCityRadio620 Stop being a homer.

WE💥G O T💥ALOT💥P O P P I N GLast game before the trade deadline … could this be the last time we see Terrence Ross in a Magic uniform? Will the Magic bounce back after two poor performances at home this past weekend? 

#MagicTogether #OrlandoMagic #NBA https://t.co/h64NlXrXEN“League personnel expect Orlando will find a new home for Terrence Ross in a similar deal structure that saw the Magic part with Evan Fournier for two second-round picks last season. Meanwhile, Gary Harris has been painted as a potential buyout candidate if he is not moved.” https://t.co/7iGSsIZD3L@OrlandoMagic @chrisrock @Ballislife lil penny the real Id, psychoanalysis 1012022 WHEELCHAIR BASKETBALL TOURNAMENT
