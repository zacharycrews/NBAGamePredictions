Why do you gotta bring race into everything 2. Show how the vaccine is proven to work years after you get it@stephdillrides @NBA @BrooklynNets Only resident in SF.@BamForTheSlam @stephdillrides @NBA @BrooklynNets I know what vaccines are supposed to do and this isn’t it. We can have a scientific debate about how vaccines have stopped transmission of polio, meningitis, measles, etc. and how this mRNA therapy isn’t working, increasing variants and causes myocarditis in young men. Let’s go!@GSWRevengeTour @NBA @BrooklynNets He is a visitor. Unvaccinated beal played in barclays center. It is unfair@NBA @BrooklynNets So are u vaxxed or not?@BrooklynNets @HSpecialSurgery We are saved we having our fucking shitty hero in the person of Irving he is available this guy fucks everyone but we continue to support him wake up guys !!.@BrooklynNets granny isn’t getting out if you don’t beat Warriors today https://t.co/TKvuB3WymB@mox_zi @DaGoatx_x @Badz24303077 @GSWRevengeTour @NBA @BrooklynNets Yh but also from a moral perspective it’s very unfair but it still effects every team in the nba not just warriors or nets🤷🏾‍♂️so there’s really nothing you can say@NBA @BrooklynNets Poetry@sifyNF @DaGoatx_x @Badz24303077 @GSWRevengeTour @NBA @BrooklynNets It's still in California where you can't goto a game w/o vax.

The league will do anything to fuck the warriors. You can't even go to a game without a bossier shot but kyrie is practicing on our court RN TF. The league scared of Warriors.@stephdillrides @NBA @BrooklynNets Only if you live there it makes 0 sense. So Wiggins had to get vaccinated to play home games for the Warriors because he lives there but Kyrie can play in the same game against him unvaccinated lol shit is stupid.@stephdillrides @NBA @BrooklynNets That’s for the home players it’s the same rules in NYC@milt9n_ @NBA @BrooklynNets There's a mandate that you can't play if your unvaxxed in sf@Badz24303077 @GSWRevengeTour @NBA @BrooklynNets Nobody afraid of a part time player. Also the suns are definitely afraid of gsw 😂@TejS40 @NBA @BrooklynNets Apply@TejS40 @NBA @BrooklynNets Rule only applie to home team players.@TattooYourFace @NBA @BrooklynNets Was about to type the SAME EXACT THING. Wiggins has to be Vaxxed, Nets have mandate due to NYC mandate sooo how can Kyrie play there on the road? It was never about science or safety. Its about control@stephdillrides @cazziblanco @NBA @BrooklynNets Disgusted to share the same fandom as you 🤢@j0rdanpoole @NBA @BrooklynNets he doesn't live in sf??@rTghost2 @br_Andy1 @MolefiMofoken17 @NBA @BrooklynNets @warriors He can play since he’s visiting need a negative test tho@MarkGre84321817 @BrooklynNets I don’t think kyrie can play Bc it’s in Cali and you have to be vaccinated@NBA @BrooklynNets I ain kno covid hoop like that@NBA @BrooklynNets People still don’t seem to understand he can play anywhere but New York and Toronto@GSWRevengeTour @NBA @BrooklynNets What’s unfair is you can be vaccinated, boosted and Covid POSITIVE but still allowed to attend a game cause you have a QR code. Kyrie’s not sick and he’s exempt per SFDPH. As a Dubs fan, I want to see him play my guys.@NBA @BrooklynNets Which fan base is worse@NBA @BrooklynNets Stephen Curry drills shots from the midcourt while Kyrie Irving is doing lay-ups in the warm-up. We can tell who's going to win tonight 😂@chicinthegeek I got a new phone today and the Verizon guy and the security guard were arguing about the Nets and my nosey ass jumped in because the salesman was saying no one could beat Brooklyn with the big 3 at full strength and I had to agree with him and tell the security the was WRONG!@cazziblanco @NBA @BrooklynNets The vaccine doesn’t work
I thought we were told the vaccine would prevent people from getting COVID 🤷‍♂️@DaGoatx_x @Badz24303077 @GSWRevengeTour @NBA @BrooklynNets Nets have the exact same ruining so it’s fair 🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️away players play at the Barclays too@yeahokbuddy473 @NBA @BrooklynNets Change ur user to (24-26) 😆Brooklyn Nets for me.

That said, Blade has enough cash to survive a nuclear winter. They aren't going anywhere.@SInow Brooklyn Nets, the Nets would win the NBA championship with Simmons. He solves their problems on defense, offensively he only has to "contribute". This with  Harden,KD roster, Kyrie odd man out.@NickFriedell ,@BrooklynNets could easily be in six place if they continue to lose games.  Currently they in fourth place behind Cleveland.
