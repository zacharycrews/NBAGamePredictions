Without rob the Celtics would prob be the easiest matchup@margeracrvg @TheEvanOfficial @seeksd9 @celtics Trolling or brain dead?@JShuttlesworthh @KnowItAllSims @celtics Oh my. No need to be like that. We have a lot more affection for Nik around here than the average Celtics fan.@celtics Ouch@margeracrvg @TheEvanOfficial @seeksd9 @celtics I also bet $10k on Rob having 10 3’s tonight. Nooooo!!!!@celtics Welp. First place was good while it lasted lol@celtics Looks like no W@SamBergerShow @wingnut445 @celtics 😂
I know enough, bub. You're literally no one, with no platform, acting like you're someone. Regurgitating takes from the worst sports media region nerds in the country. Here hoping Rob is hurt bad so you can dunk on Boston fans saying "See, I predicted doom". It's pathetic kid.@sarahrimmington @celtics Ime, I guess. Be careful though. White and Smart, Grant and Theis are still playing and the Raptors can’t score. Oh, PP been like Steph for two months. 😂@SmithRaps @TermineRadio the @celtics seem to have the Scotty Barnes flu @SmithRaps #WeTheNorth@jc23mufc @celtics Nah this is fucked up 😭😭😭@celtics Pritchard, Theis, Smart each dropping 20+ lets goooo. It’s Stauskas time@JaysGotNext @anthony24hrs @celtics Isn’t an acl injury, is a meniscus injury. Rob will be back in a month@celtics Nobody wants that #1 seed now huh 🤣 🤣@burnit01 @celtics This matchup could be the Eastern Final.What a story Boston Celtics are creating.

What a turnaround, greatest in #NBA History? 🤔 https://t.co/ZKJn4c5Rr6@celtics Wow really we needed y’all to win not lose smhSuiting up for my first NBA regular season game tonight. No matter the twists and turns, highs and lows, it was all worth it. Let’s go! @celtics ☘️@BammyBurner @KingdomOfJT_0 @celtics Philly are frauds nobody scared of them. Wouldn’t want the bucks though@BammyBurner @rishi_sahadeo @celtics He's talking about raps getting 5 seed.. I think@KingdomOfJT_0 @celtics Yeah i Hope Payton will go on god mode like he did those last 4 gamesBoston Celtics vs. Toronto Raptors

Boston leads their season series 2-1 against the Raptors. Regardless of the previous stats, the Toronto Raptors are in a fight for the 6th seed in the East. 

Knowing this, we believe this will be an invigorating match! https://t.co/IKU9iC5hR9@margeracrvg @seeksd9 @celtics I'd say bet on raps even if they didnt have the injuries@rishi_sahadeo @KingdomOfJT_0 @celtics Assuming the Celtics drop with these injuries I would rather play the Celtics then say bucks or Philly. I don’t see Celtics dropping anywhere past 3Here is the latest playoff standings update as the Boston Celtics pass the Philadelphia 76ers for the No. 1 seed.  https://t.co/1eapsWD3DG@celtics STOP@chef_mj @celtics @Raptors Two red hot teams....@celtics Good decision, get the Jays healthy@rishi_sahadeo @celtics If yall don't beat the Celtics tn I would just give up on the foreseeable future for the Raptors@TheEvanOfficial @seeksd9 @celtics almost all in, all that i have in my account@celtics Hey @tracywine105 - I might be jinxing it, but who do I thank on the Celtics for improving the Raptors' odds to stay out of the play-in?@celtics Damn i wanted to see raps vs celtics both starting line ups...@sarahrimmington @KnowItAllSims @celtics go back to craptors twitter with that energy sarah@NestPgs @celtics I believe it’s usually 3-6 weeks or so I’ve been told.

Speedy recovery sir.Prayers for the Time Lord🙏🏼 @celtics #CelticsThe Boston Celtics are now tied in first in the Eastern Conference 👀👀👀@celtics Good decision@celtics Peaked a month too early@J_todd87 @HollywoodShack @celtics The knee has two meniscuses (menisci?); the lateral and the medial. Lateral injuries are typically less severe, which is what Rob has, so I'm cautiously optimistic he'll be back sooner rather than laterCeltics injury luck remains abysmal.

Get well soon Rob, take it easy and heal up.

The Knicks have a hard time winning on their own home court most games!!@Nick20041985 @celtics @rob_williamsIII He played through it for a little while after this. It may not be as bad as you think, especially since his knee didn't really buckle/crumple or force him into the agony you see from folks who've torn their ACL.@celtics Rest him Ime@CelticsNewswire @celtics I believe that it's the Celtics defense that's incredible, and it's the defense that lead to the entire turnaround for our team this season. Also, doing the little things like hustling, rebounding and just playing hard all of the time. Their effort is recognized and appreciated!!I did not see this coming on January 23rd when they were a game under .500 #BostonCeltics https://t.co/00RIp4Kksy@Nick20041985 @DarkhorsePrey @celtics @rob_williamsIII Based on what? He played for quite a while after this clip. If he was hurting that bad he would have left the game.The @celtics are the No 1 seed in the East... BRUH!!! 🔥🔥In January the @celtics were the 10 seed in the East and Tatum couldn’t hit a three. We are the number one seed and Tatum has scored more points than any player in the NBA.The Boston Celtics are on top of the Eastern Conference on after they trampled the Minnesota Timberwolves. Can the Celtics extend their six-game winning streak to seven in Toronto? #NBA

They lost 112-134 over the Boston Celtics and they’ve fallen to a 43-33 record on the season. They’ve now lost 3 out of their last 4.

I think that one is a stretch bub. Especially with the Celtics decimating every team they face currently. No matter which court. Home Away, doesn't matter. The Celtics are the best team in the East. Doubt all u want.@celtics Great win. Going to Toronto on a back-to-back without Al &amp; Williams will be very tough. I forgot to mention, and I can guarantee this, @FCHWPO (Jaylen Brown) won’t be making the trip either. Not because he’s hurt but because he’s unvaccinated. He’s letting his team down.#NBATwitter

They’re 25-6 since (22-3 since Jan. 29) with the #1 defense &amp; #2 net in the NBA.

Today they are 1st in the East.

A historic mid season turnaround.
