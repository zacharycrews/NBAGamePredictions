The Indiana Pacers looked at Chris Duarte and asked "Why not?"
That No. 13 spot in the lottery is looking pretty lucky based on Duarte's role and contributions five games in.

Why is their games blacked out in my market? I get the Indiana Pacers, but not the Grizzlies. Especially when we can’t watch the Warriors game tonight bc of them playing Memphis 😡The Raptors have back to back games.
Tomorrow is vs the Orlando Magic. The 30th, we go vs the Indiana Pacers again.
I think we should have both of these games but it will be hard cause we will be tired for sure.
