But it might be demeaning to call someone who has been in the league 16 years the second Rudy. He's top 100 all time in the NBA in scoring. How about his own words: "No Slouch." Or wait for something else natural to evolve like with the Minivan.@utahjazz @RudyGay @SociosHoops My apologies for this poor tweet last night. 

It should have said G Spot because the D couldn’t find him last night. 

I will strive to do better tweets going forward.ICYMI: The Utah Jazz had a lot to say about Rudy “Ocho” Gay, after his long-awaited debut with the team, including this gem from Joe Ingles: “He’s a hell of a player 26 seasons in.”
