JAVALE MCGEE🤨 Dumbass Warriors chose to sign Zaza Pachulia and Looney and let the the man who actually helped them win the title go to the Lakers?🤨 Warriors are basically a bunch of clowns when it comes to picking talent!@Suns have the best fan base https://t.co/INFBd0Fr5V@Matt_Krell @BillSimmons @Jumpshot8 @Suns @TermineRadio @ringer Payne's ability to modulate his pace has been big.  It'll help open the floor for his lefty finishes that Ds were timing well late last season.  Him and Holliday are giving kind of lead guard depth that we will need without stretch bigs facilitating from post like last yea..
