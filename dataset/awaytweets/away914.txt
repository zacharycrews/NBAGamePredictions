These lines will be higher tomorrow, I could go in deep detail on why that is but there’s no need. Let’s go 2-0 tomorrow 🤌🏽 #nbabets #GamblingTwitter #sportsbettingpicksCan some good centers in the NBA please ask for their buyout so that the Minnesota Timberwolves can pick you up and have an actual center taller than 6'9 in the paint so they don't lose games by the offensive rebounds? We're 1 day away from March, you want a playoff run or nah?Nuggets have won 7 of their last 8 games and are currently tied with the 5th-seeded Dallas Mavericks at 36-25.
