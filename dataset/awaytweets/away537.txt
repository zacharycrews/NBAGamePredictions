Suns vs nets
Suns vs bucks

This @suns team just made it to the finals didn't lose anybody and got better they can win a ring this year but it's gonna be tough but tbh most likely lol I got a feelingTbh last year whoever was coming out of the east was winning the ring this was the @suns first playoff in years first finals since 1993 being a vet shows itself only in the playoffs@Suns are undoubtedly 3rd and yes they've gotten their teeth wet but the @warriors and @nets just got that elite veteran advantage that you only see in playoff gamesPhoenix Suns begin 2022 with 14 games in 28 days highlighted by back-to-back vs. Utah Jazz - The Arizona Republic https://t.co/qICeuByWZYThere’s no way I’m voting for anyone else in the west. These 5 earned their place rightfully! Ain’t no debate @Suns https://t.co/YTbozym7RH@pdgetfree3 I just saw warriors destroy Phoenix without Klay. Klay makes warriors better on both ends. Another lights out shooter that moves well without the ball and elite perimeter defender on Booker. Suns will lose in 5 vs a healthy Warriors team.NBA Basketball Game Betting Picks Simulator: 1/2/2022 7:00 PM ET - Phoenix Suns vs. Charlotte Hornets - YOU CAN RUN THE GAME SIMULATION FOR FREE HERE: https://t.co/E7Zu1D5EF9 #nba #sportsbetting #freepicks #cappertekI have a feeling @Suns will go on an absolute tear once they get everyone back, get 20-25 win streak together going into the playoffs@andrew_kal @Suns Hahahah damn that’s EXACTLY who he looks like@purdyflaco @Suns Lionel Richie looking MFKPJ and Wood are thugs and should be traded to the Phoenix Suns for Landry Shamet, Abdel Nader, and a kroger’s coupon 💯On this day in sports history January 2, Phoenix Suns Point Guard Steve Nash recorded 28 Points, 5 Rebounds, and 22 Assists against the New York Knicks in 2006.On this day in sports history January 2, Phoenix Suns Power Forward Amar’e Stoudemire scored 50 Points in a 117-98 win against the Portland Trail Blazers in 2005.@andrew_kal @Suns Otto Porter looks like an 80s porn star lmao@Bucks @Suns @warriors ok so basically all of y’all let Bk get the best record in the league https://t.co/EvxKoULkFXOn this day in sports history January 2, Phoenix Suns Point Guard Tony Delk scored 53 Points against the Sacramento Kings in 2001.Phoenix Suns Bledsoe https://t.co/duK57A7WsN🔥704 Night🔥

They COULD have Miles Bridges and PJ Washington back as they were activated off of the COVID list.@DamonBruce Why not against @Suns on Christmas night?The @lakers best 3 wins of the season came against Memphis Grizzles,Miami Heat &amp; Charlotte Hornets in OT! The @warriors biggest victories came against the Phoenix Suns twice,Jazz in Utah &amp; Brooklyn Nets in Brooklyn &amp; Chicago Bulls to name a few…  @StephenCurry30 #Unanimous MVP@LakersDynastyLD @Suns @hornets shit i hope knocking on kupchak’s door to take plumlee’s roster spot 😂@brittbabyyx @Suns @hornets Plumbum for McGee seems fair to meThe Warriors beat a fully healthy Jazz team in Utah 123-116 without Draymond Green. Exactly a week ago they beat a fully healthy Suns team in Phoenix without Wiggins and Poole. 

Pretty astounding they’re doing this all without Klay Thompson.@brittbabyyx @Suns @hornets What’s Larry Johnson doing these days? Lolhey @suns y’all tryna get plumlee too? just thought i’d make the offer on behalf of every hornets fan, since you seem to love the @hornets discard pile of centers so much https://t.co/Uua1AHA500@lindseyrbhair @Suns @LEVIS Go suns@LockoutBruh Padres, Florida Panthers, Buffalo Bills, Phoenix Suns.Warriors on Christmas: beat the Suns in Phoenix
On New Year's Day: beat the Jazz in Utah - without Draymond Green. 123-116
- Curry 28p, Wiggins 25, Porter 20The Warriors just beat the Suns in Phoenix a week ago on Christmas without Wiggins and Poole. Tonight they beat the Jazz in Utah on New Years. There’s really no way you can say they aren’t the best team in the West right now.The Warriors won in Phoenix against a fully stocked Suns team on Christmas without Wiggins/Poole. They beat a fully stocked Jazz team tonight in Utah without Draymond Green. Record: 28-7. Klay Thompson's return is "very close."1/1/72 – Among myriad other spectacular plays that made him the superstar that he was, Connie Hawkins (25p/12r) dunked the ball in arguably the most impressive way, a one-handed jam over Hank Finkel, leading the Phoenix #Suns to a 114-104 win over the Boston Celtics. #ValleyProud https://t.co/1RGk1MxJVdWarriors beat the Suns in Phoenix with like 1 third of their team out with Covid, and beat the Jazz in Utah without Draymond! #DubNation@DejaRu22 Phoenix Arizona  best Sun Gaze u can getPhoenix Suns Game Today vs Boston Celtics Odds, Lineups, Prediction

@Iam_VikasGupta https://t.co/LiMpg289iu@Suns @DeandreAyton RATIOOOOOOOOOOO@DeandreAyton you’re the best player on the phoenix suns, a team in the national basketball association@Isozzzz @JJMaples55_MST Honestly I thought the suns at first! But after the warriors beat them without wigs, Poole and klay while phoenix was at full strength I just think the warriors are the better version of what the suns are trying to attempt.@jchizzy21 Yep. I like games like this. I’d say one more against them and then against Phoenix will be the measuring stick, because it’s likely to be a Warriors v. Jazz/Suns WCF.#DevinBooker is an #NBAAllStar starter.
