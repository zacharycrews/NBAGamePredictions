New York Sports teams haven't played with any real stakes in a decade... 

That's why this feels like a Playoff game. Sad, but true. Hopefully the Knicks, and the other teams from NY, can play some actually meaningful games in the Playoffs this year.#SportsBetting #SportsPicks

Knicks are a playoff team and more experienced. We all know the Bulls can't win them all. I believe it comes down to the last bucket regardless. Tight, defensive game.That BING BONG video is why New York is a Knicks town and always best when relevantüëèüèæ Deserving honors to Bulls great Joakim Noah.
But on the Knicks:
-Couldn't stay on the floor...said "I'm too lit to play in New York City."
-When he was on the floor, shot 43.9 % from the free throw line.
-Suspended for PEDs
-Fought with coach
