From my PoV I called this about Cade while in college .  He has limitations that the experts didnt seem to wanna walk about 

The game vs Mjtchell was eye opener . Had him in jail

March Madness is officially here! https://t.co/FIRotlgnRqEnjoyed going to the @DetroitPistons game today at the LCA.  The turning point in the game was when Cade Cunninghan picked up his fifth foul with (roughly) 7:30 left.  Without his offense, the Celtics took advantage to earn the win....

Came away impressed by Cunningham...I hate to say a win against the Pistons is a great win, but today was a great win. The officials were absolutely horrendous. They gave Detroit a lot of calls and missed quite a few for the C's. They absolutely ruined any type of flow to the game.@DetroitPistons @RipHamilton32 I was there that night.

I heard earlier that this start time had something to do with the Detroit Pistons having a home game this afternoon...🤔🙄
#LeafsForever@Jbbintrappin @ericjr2018 @AnnaHorford @DetroitPistons lmfaooo I wouldn't call losing by 1 point an "ass-whooping" but go off I guess...So the Pistons played earlier today.

make it right somehow please, I know yall are better than that!!@AnnaHorford @DetroitPistons honestly this is really surprising/ shocking to me... it's not like them at all and sorry you experienced that. 😪😕😒💚@AnnaHorford @DetroitPistons I mean it is Detroit.. 🤦🏽‍♀️🤣🤣🤣@victoriastewxrt It sounds like @MapleLeafs are starting half an hour later than they normally would on Saturdays.  This is because of Little Ceasars Arena converting from the basketball court used for a @DetroitPistons game earlier.@stevenrsario10 @Jbbintrappin @ericjr2018 @AnnaHorford @DetroitPistons Yeah your right lmao, I missed that, Detroit ain’t whooping nobody 😂

They fucking play though tho@AnnaHorford @DetroitPistons They lost.. their manners too.@Jbbintrappin @ericjr2018 @AnnaHorford @DetroitPistons Lol it was by 1 point that's hardly an ass whopping.
