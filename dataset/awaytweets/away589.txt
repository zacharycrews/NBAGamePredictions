More tips @ https://t.co/iiG5ByAJdl .If the NBA expands to Seattle and Las Vegas, it would allow the NBA to move the Memphis Grizzlies &amp; Minnesota Timberwolves to the NBA Eastern Conference. New Orleans Pelicans could also be a possibility but I think the T-Wolves make switch for closer rivals.LIVE ~ Minnesota Timberwolves vs. Houston Rockets - NBA League 2022
