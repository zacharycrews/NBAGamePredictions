#forever404 https://t.co/Z5ylXCk7ikKnicks ML +125 

New York 7-3 in their last 10 games facing the hawks who are 2-8 in their last 10 games. Hawks defense is the absolute worst defense in the NBA and they have a rest disadvantage after a back to back last night. New York comes in fresh and with cam reddish. Easy $ https://t.co/74RygniW1o@Fournier2Heaven @nyknicks I think he would be too. He’s be able to create for himself instead of just differing to Randle and getting ball when he wants him to have it.

I heard the game on the radio I was at work. Couldn’t believe what I heard! Went very high pitched at work😂😂@YungSplash @nyknicks I’d take the trade tbh. Grimes can improve our shooting especially from 3 and Kemba has the handles and awareness like JB. Problem is we need a big man so iguess i’d take Mitchell Robinson and throw in Moses and Sterling for Grimes/Robinson.😂😂😂 New York City Sports media is fickle. Weren’t ya’ll giving Julius Randle the keys to the city a few weeks ago?? But yes, RJ is now the man, considering Knicks brass ran the Kevin Knox trade by him first and not Randle. https://t.co/6mcml571qPMy face when the @nyknicks get over .500 tonight https://t.co/ksc3GlGc7N@ItsMrMilton @nyknicks Nah we need more than that🔴Live ~ New York Knicks vs. Atlanta Hawks - NBA League 2022 2022 💯

That’s not subjective. Picks have clear historically defined value based on position. Idc if ppl root for 9 but they are rooting against the lions in this case. https://t.co/2GHWcFniQqGood luck to @nyknicks today versus @ATLhawks

4-Unit Play. #526. Take Atlanta Hawks -2 over New York Knicks (Saturday @ 7:40pm Est)@86DustinB @Ives2Nice @ChrisSalts @nyknicks If you think that the idea that some fans care more than others is *inaccurate* then you’re really reaching. Call it what it is, the lions have pissed you off enough and it feels good to root for a winner and you’re using Stafford to it. OK…that time I was being condescending@86DustinB @Ives2Nice @ChrisSalts @nyknicks Fandom doesn’t make me feel better or worse about myself but my ability to not name call and stay rational definitely does. Objectively speaking if you’re rooting for something that’s against your team’s interest it means you’d rather see 9 win than the lions benefit.I don’t get how people can switch it up and hate on Julius Randle. Guy is the best player on the @nyknicks and what he did for us last year was unbelievable. Yeah he’s not scoring 25 every game like last year but he also doesn’t need to.

New York acquired forward Cam Reddish in a trade with the Atlanta Hawks.

I love being a Knicks fan these days.6 seed is all I ask of y’all @nyknicks@KnicksNation @nyknicks Now the same for Zion ? 😅@j_feller @kylemaggio @nyknicks Under team control for 2.5 seasons. The salary also puts them back under the cap, so there's more ability to do something, and a 1st round pick gives them another cost controlled player for 4 years next years draft.  It's not a bad trade overall for them@j_feller @kylemaggio @nyknicks They've spent their last 2 lottery picks on guys who play his same position who they collectively pay less than half of his salary and the team operates well without him. Hield is gone this off-season, no one is going to Sac willingly, so Fournier gives them a legit nba 2/3..@86DustinB @ChrisSalts @nyknicks Dustin are you upset by my joke?@nyknicks Ok dumb question but where’s Ju@j_feller @kylemaggio @nyknicks Conventional wisdom 48 hours ago was the Hawks would never accept Knox and a 1st that may take years to convey for Reddish.  Look at the Kings overall situation right now.  new management, with an interim coach, over the cap with a perennial losing situation to show for it ..@jfromflorida1 @nyknicks @NY_KnicksPR Burks is Thibs guy &amp; Fournier has 18M/3years..

Ewing was loved, no question……but it would be a bit oblivious if not aware of all the criticisms he received.

It got bit louder with late 90s Knicks@KnicksMSGN @camreddish @nyknicks Cam Reddish  by far, the worst on-off splits for the Hawks this season:
Atl has a -10.0 net rating in 797 minutes with him on the floor
Atl has a +5.7 net rating in 1,123 minutes with Reddish off the floor.
 Must have been as 32%  from 3 or his 38%FG.
