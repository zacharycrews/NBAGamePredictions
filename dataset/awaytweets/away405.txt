We agree hereDems are the Sacramento Kings of politics. Perpetual losers.

But even the Kings would win sometimes if there were only 2 teams in the league. https://t.co/pVg8cjnrUTThe Sacramento Kings would choke if they could make free throws #SacramentoProudJust noticed that on Saturday, Jan. 29, both the Flyers (1 p.m.) and the Sixers (7:30 p.m.) will be hosting games at the Wells Fargo Center against the Kings (Los Angeles and Sacramento, respectively) . . . 

They had never played both the same day before . . .After the announcement that Indiana wants to trade its top veterans, the general expectation is that Domantas Sabonis will attract commercial interest in the league.

Phoenix Suns and Sacramento Kings have shown interest in the pivot in recent years.

PLEASE do something. Anything. Make a move PRETTY PLEASE. 

- All @SacramentoKings fans@NotDFoxburner @CharronElliott1 @TheNBACentral @ShamsCharania Bagley and Davion alone is a W for Indy, idk why the kings would want that though.

We just need the Kings organization to do its part on the court.@NBACanada @SacramentoKings @Raptors Raptors s ore 100pts in a half vs the Kings.@JillAdge @SacramentoKings @mmcnair The Team are the members that plays in the court, coaches &amp; staff that’s in practices &amp; games. The organization assembles the “Team” &amp; makes overall decision in w/c direction it goes via trade, picks, etc., runs the business side &amp; more importantly establishes the overall cultureWhy do they continue to keep the Sacramento Kings have a franchise and year after draft the best talent and ruin their careers but we can't get a team in Seattle?

Comment Below ⬇️ https://t.co/8zzBfxsZ09@Hardiman_12 @SacramentoKings Happy Birthday!!!! 🎂🎁🎊Alright @SacramentoKings I need a win for my birthday please@TheNBACentral @ShamsCharania Give me Deaaron Fox for Sabonis, send it. @Pacers @SacramentoKings@pickuphoop Hey @DetroitPistons @SacramentoKings he's really good. Take him.@cessianooo I’d imagine the Kings would like those picks but instead of Kemba &amp; Fournier they’d probably want IQ/Obi/Mitch. Would be a larger haul in terms of potential for Sacramento. Also not sure if they’re actually willing to move him.For instance, you could make this work salary wise by including Fournier to Philly and Korkmaz to Sacramento so:

76ers: Fox, Fournier
Knicks: Simmons
Kings: Randle, KorkmazThe Toronto Raptors are back in action tonight as they host the Sacramento Kings at Scotiabank Arena! 

#WeTheNorth -4.5(-109) &amp; -189

Under 220.5 -105

#NBA75 https://t.co/ETSbOXQtVQCould a 3 team trade centered around below make any sense?

Knicks get: Simmons
Philly gets: Fox
Sacramento: Randle

Other things would be included to bridge the gap on talent/salary. Thoughts?

Now, not really having any family left, the holidays are a sad reminder of better times. I just try helping others who have no one to have a hot meal and company.@CarmichaelDave Dave, I'm very proud and thankful for your persistence and your career, your contributions to Sacramento were integral to the Sac Kings staying in the city, what you did will be remembered forever. It's an excellent premise for an independent film.@Michael41690186 @SacramentoKings Right there with ya ✊@j_sepan5ki @SacramentoKings Understood….

Sacramento Kings is a dumpster fire franchise, fired their head coach but still stinks. Can’t punish Buddy Hield for that crap.@FadeawayWorld @jkubatko Sacramento kingsLast night before the Cavs broadcast, there was some footage from the Rochester Royals (the forebears of today's Sacramento Kings) and this one dude did this "layup" that looked like some unreal BS even by today's standards.
