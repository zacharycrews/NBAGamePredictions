https://t.co/434VUM0kOG@ChadwikoTWW Exactly, Ive been said this. Knickerbockers, Yankees, Red stockings/Sox, Lakers, Redskins. All these names without the history and us being accustomed to them sound weird and/or corny at face value. Oklahoma City Thunder sounded weird in 2008, now its normal. Just takes timeThe Houston Rockets continued their climb out of the cellar with their fourth straight win, sweeping the Oklahoma City Thunder in their back-to-back matchups, 114-110, on Wednesday (Thursday, Manila time).
