Hoping the boys can bounce back tonight against the Kings!!L❤🏀❤🏀 #WeTheNorth https://t.co/XljnvZJqMW@alibubbs @Raptors No, I don't. This team's offense &amp; personnel don't pair well. You have an undersized starting pg that teams know, can't finish at the rim. Bigs that don't play in the post, teams know that &amp; force Raps to be more a perimeter shooting team that's not filled with great shooters.Kyle was the best thing that ever happened to the Raptors. He was their heart, their fire...an incredible leader. IMO his "never accept second best" attitude changed the culture in Toronto. https://t.co/jLdEhbiBuM@TorontoScottie @Raptors Nah actually I tried to warn you.
