It was the last of 106 consecutive 25-point games for Chamberlain, the longest such streak in NBA history. https://t.co/TdBdZfQ8Ds@currysgoatt_ @xClubster @warriors Harden didn't have to recruit KD to his 73 win team because he blew a 3-1 lead and couldn't beat LeBron. Say what you want about Harden in Houston, but he didn't have to pull one of the biggest bitch moves in NBA history like Curry did. That's Steph's real legacy.Steph Curry hit "just" five threes last night, keeping him one shy of tying Ray Allen for most all time (the Golden State Warriors still picked up the 102-100 victory over the Indiana Pacers)

Second of all, Ray Allen took 7,429 attemps in a span of 18 years. Curry attempted 6,889 in a span of 12. Consistency is key and that's a luxury that Ray barely had in his era.Lebron was out of this world and in his bag when the Cavs beat arguably the best or one of the best teams in history, The Golden State Warriors. First team ever to come back from a 3-1 deficit. Also he very phenomenal defensively too. Kyrie was a Phenom!

#DubNation@burrrrrberry @warriors Every year,long term futures are risk/reward. I learned about this in Reno from a chain smoking horse race expert. Folks who do this as a job, I tend to bend an ear. My best longterm nba bet right now,if the team stays healthy( oh and klay is about to come back) is golden state.Stephen Curry finished one 3-pointer shy of the NBA career record on Monday night, making five 3-pointers and scoring 26 points to help the Golden State Warriors rally late for a 102-100 win over the Indiana Pacers. https://t.co/bXKUirYZop@SportsGrid @warriors Show a clip if steph on that last defensive possession🤭@warriors Good job.@RyanRayReed @NBA @warriors He tripped on Gary's D.Steph Curry.

I hope Kuminga can share some minutes with him or Draymond when those two are on the bench.@tess_tikle @SportsGrid @warriors y’all create narrative to make him a non clutch player. They had a rough night offensively, but with a minute left in the game down 5. Steph makes a 3 and follow that up with a layup that should’ve been and 1. All you care about is the miss that should’ve been and 1 too@pulluppopouttt @warriors i know right 😌👌🏻@statmuse @StephenCurry30 @warriors @WarriorsPR Praying Covid doesn't hit him🙏🙏I don't believe they can beat the @warriors or @BrooklynNets #nbafinals2022 @3peatwarriors01 @Thekingiscrown1 https://t.co/jPhiIL12ej@warriors @googlecloud LoonGOD@JakeElrod44 @Michonn79884930 @NBA @warriors Both can be true.

Plus-Minus doesn't tell us about Curry's impact we don't already know.

Y'all forget Warriors was one of the worst teams in the league last year. Had it not been for Curry dropping 57 every night, they'd have no wins. Instead of complaining that we won by 2 points, appreciate the better season 🙄@warriors @googlecloud LD Looney caught up in 🔥 make the difference how much do he need to do but he is doing well with his wisdom playing his game right in the right direction and the right time to win 🏆 games GSW .

We need to do what teams being doing to us on the inside pass to Looney on the inside and let him dunk it@JakeElrod44 @Michonn79884930 @NBA @warriors But if they aren’t hitting shots when you’re out it subtracts. Because it’s point differential (in game) - point differential (out of game). That’s why it is one of the statistics that shows stephs on court “gravity” impactsCurry drains a team high 26pts including 5 more 3pt makes as the @warriors (22-5) outlast the @Pacers 102-100. #DubNation@RealRm30 @megbleachers @statmuse @StephenCurry30 @warriors @WarriorsPR Mf we’re talking about the garden not the smoothie king center 😂The @warriors just needed one basket to cover! https://t.co/qSfcUWpoEgWarriors beat Pacers, 102-100, as Steph Curry leads the side with 26 PTS, 6 REB, 6 AST!

Pacers fans are such good nice people, respect y’all and that’s for being so inviting to us warriors fans@g_evw @warriors Trade this ratio.@Michonn79884930 @NBA @warriors Yes, but it also has to do with how the team plays with you off of the court.

Steph shot much worse, but was +17 (highest from both teams). Sabonis killed us inside all game tho, great game.Won the USA Pickleball National Championship with Paul Rudanich in the 65+ age group, 4.0 skill level. @Medicileaf1 @Big3N3ws @warriors https://t.co/perIWDmoHn@warriorsworld Warriors as an organization really need to get to League's officials to address this ASAP --  otherwise,  it will be too late when they'll get Steph hurt on the court!!!

It's blatant, dangerous fouls on Steph right and left, and refs pretend not to see them!!!

@warriors@noringsforever @warriors @OfficialNBARefs This is moronic. Pacers attack the inside more thats why they have more FTs. GSW has to play rough Ds too since they are playing small.@yeezysosa @VersatileNBA @warriors @googlecloud drake looke nice in this photo😮‍💨@warriors Great win, but Steph missing the three in the finals seconds not just to win it but to secure a historic record is a microcosm of his careerIf Kevin Harlan will call the game tomorrow against the Warriors and the Knicks I want him to exactly say this “look at curry so inspirational man”
