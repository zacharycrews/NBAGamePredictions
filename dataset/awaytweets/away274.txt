Find out if there is any value in our preview. #GamblingTwitter #Punters https://t.co/enFlwKnO9o@hughesaz @addicted2helmet I'm just glad my favorite NHL team, the Washington Capitals and my NBA team the Washington Wizards (Bullets) went back to their original colors which were Red, White and Navy Blue. When they went to Downtown DC from Landover, it was Blue, Gold and Black for both teams for a whileThe Washington wizards would never win anything if they think Bradley Beal is there “⭐️ player” Bradley Beal is a common copy of  Russell Westbrook. Loser Tommy Shepard need to trade him if the Wizards is going to progress.  Real talk@NativeSonn @LakersNation Montrez Harrell is NOT A NBA PLAYOFF KIND OF POST DEFENDER. 😭😭😭 Strictly for the Regular season, both L.A. teams trying to win NBA Championships. The Washington Wizards have smaller dreams, Montrez perfect for their smaller dreams.#Pelicans shootaround update ahead of Wednesday's 7 p.m. home game vs. Wizards (Devonte' Graham expected to be game-time decision; Graham on impact of Hernangomez, Zion; Washington scouting report focus on Beal, Avdija; lineup notes + keys): https://t.co/AVxOijHWFd https://t.co/2G6FOgIIvQSistema #NBA75  🏀

“But the smarter money still seems to be on him staying in Washington and getting the full five-year, $242 million bag.”

My expectations were a 500 team and building up. 
I really hope the Pistons don't become the Washington Wizards, or the old NJ Nets.Pulling off a five-team trade in the NBA is difficult. 

@JeffZillgitt with an inside look at how the Washington Wizards came out on top of the multi-team trade that sent Russell Westbrook to Los Angeles Lakers.
 https://t.co/DeCrXv32sd@unofficialdboss HE LOVES IT IN WASHINGTON THIS WAS AT TRAINING CAMP AND HERSHEY 5 YEARS AGO HE IS NOW UNCLE VITEK TO SERGEI AND GOES OUT WITH THE BABIES FOR DESSERT AND TO WIZARDS GAMES HE JUST MISSED HIS BESTIE they were literally in the car together when jakub was traded 🧍🏻‍♀️
