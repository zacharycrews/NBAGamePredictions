Go Detroit Pistons@RRBBSLIME @marviemarv__ NBA fans are still soft af.

In NBA history, only two other players have had such a streak:

Steph Curry (twice) and James Harden (twice).

Siakam, OG, GTJ etc arent it.@Raptors 20\62 at the end of the 3rd and you talk about ASG...S..U!He’s a horrendous coach that actively hindered the raptors just as much as that loser in Chicago and yet becomes a top 5 coach of all time against Toronto https://t.co/SHdcbMyjkfplease reevaluate @Raptors we ain’t winning the game.@Raptors just give up, let FVV OG and Siakam rest for tomorrow.

The fact Detroit's hammering Toronto right now has everything to do with the Raptors. It really is that simple.@Raptors This is baaaadI really can’t stand how shitty the @Raptors are against the @DetroitPistons@Raptors Win the game2007 &amp; 2011 New York Giants.

Can’t have a championship coach if at least 2 of your players refuse to play (1 literally and the other just does nothing when on the court). If the Raptors truly want to be a championship contending team, they need a better head cosch!!!@JamesWe14200015 @Raptors Nah yall just suck. Letting trey lyles dominate y'all is sad@Raptors Come on raptorsI know DC is motivated with how he got canned in Toronto, but that the Raptors can NEVER beat this shitty team when they're fighting for a playoff spot? It's early tonight, but bad first half. #Wethenorth #RaptorsGod dammit Precious. Pass the fucking ball. #RTZ #wethenorth @RaptorsWe’re @Raptors are better than this. Seems truly an off-night.

They don’t want either team to play. Both teams were in the bonus both quarters but the 2nd quarter both teams were in the bonus at the 8 min mark. 28% is bad too@Raptors The only thing colder today is Raps offense. C'mon boys just b/c Casey did a lot for the franchise doesn't mean Raps have to give every game away. Please! play it like you mean to be in the playoffs conversation.@Raptors Face it, this team sucks, totallyWhat’s going on with the @Raptors? Such a bad half@scottiethegoat4 @Raptors That’s true but the guy doesn’t even wanna do anything with the ball now as soon as he gets the ball he gives it up in an instant it’s sad to watch@princethegoat10 @Raptors I knew this shit was gonna happen once all the starters got healthy. He was gonna get relegated to basically a 5th option

I wonder if border issues played into fans not coming from Toronto...not as many Raptors jerseys as I'm used to seeing.Any Boss Cat Raptors fan out there?

Come say hi! https://t.co/2yVbjv8Jr9All geared up for  the @Raptors and @DetroitPistons game! #tangerinefanangle #raptorsfans #aboyandhisdog https://t.co/RwRSjpZRzw@Saruhambagu @Raptors @DetroitPistons Pistons are absolute assAmazing that the @Raptors can shoot 30% against the @DetroitPistons 50% and still only be down by 4 after 1Q #WeTheNorth@DetroitPistons @Raptors why the Raptors head coach gotta scream like a hogtied piggly wiggly 😭😂 easy there Wilbur 🐷🐽💀@Raptors Please just win this gamePistons clearly play the @Raptors with some different energy for sure. Do not let them get hot from the 3 and we should be good.Honestly, sloppy first quarter for the Raptors.  We're lucky to only be down 4 after 1.  I'm going to go out on a limb here, and just say it: We're not losing this game, book it.

#WeTheNorth #nba #toronto #basketball #canada@Raptors Groat 2.0@Raptors Why do we play bad teams like piston so terribly but play good teams like the suns so good? It’s embarrassing. Need more consistency and to learn how to control the ball.
