Some of his decision making skills are questionable.@Yeetdabish @TraeFor3 @ATLHawks @emoryhealthcare Yea about that...@ATLHawks @cbrownballin935 I wonder why Chaundee Brown Jr. Is not in the NBA!! This guy is a big body,tough defensive player who can also make outside shots. This guy can defend more than most of the guys in this Hawks roster. He can contribute in the playoffs for this ball club!!! Would Nate play him?@outrcty @foggieraw @ATLHawks @thederekminor @parrischariz Cool@ATLHawks @cbrownballin935 Get it @cbrownballin935! #GoBlue@ant4xs @KingJames @ATLHawks @KingJames we also been saving careers these couple years, you’re welcome to join@ATLHawks All NBA voters when they see TYs name... https://t.co/Lr3QhTA9pCI really like all different teams.
