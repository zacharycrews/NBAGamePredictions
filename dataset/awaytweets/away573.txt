I‚Äôm a 28 year old NBA fan (not even a Washington/Wizards fan) and I knew of Kevin Porter. I also assumed KPJ was his son so when I heard the comment, I thought ‚Äúnice reference.‚Äù

In that context it makes sense for a Washington TV announcer to say that on the fly. Home town announcers reference old players all the time. Makes more sense than making fun of a murder.According to Fox 5 DC, on Wednesday night, an announcer with the Washington Wizards, Glenn Consor, was calling the game against the Houston Rockets. https://t.co/fACP0R8Zp9Chicago Bulls vs. Washington Wizards NBA betting odds, lines,¬†trends https://t.co/OD5FNul5jEWashington Wizards Starters:
