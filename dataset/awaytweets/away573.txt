(Cash App: $Marlawn7) https://t.co/rS2eqIgAIhWashington Wizards (+6) @ Chicago Bulls #BullsNation #DCAboveAll #NBA #NBATwitter #NBA75@thenightmaker1 @glennconsor I did no research. I’m a 28 year old NBA fan (not even a Washington/Wizards fan) and I knew of Kevin Porter. I also assumed KPJ was his son so when I heard the comment, I thought “nice reference.”
Had no idea about KPJs real father.NBA Basketball Game Betting Picks Simulator: 8:08 PM ET - Washington Wizards vs. Chicago Bulls - YOU CAN RUN THE GAME SIMULATION FOR FREE HERE: https://t.co/QHVNjcMZpG #nba #sportsbetting #freepicks #cappertek@littletopdawg @KingJames The connection he was trying to make was older Kevin Porter played for the wizards/bullets. In that context it makes sense for a Washington TV announcer to say that on the fly. Home town announcers reference old players all the time. Makes more sense than making fun of a murder.According to Fox 5 DC, on Wednesday night, an announcer with the Washington Wizards, Glenn Consor, was calling the game against the Houston Rockets. https://t.co/fACP0R8Zp9Chicago Bulls vs. Washington Wizards NBA betting odds, lines, trends https://t.co/OD5FNul5jEWashington Wizards Starters:
