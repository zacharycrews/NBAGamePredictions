[533] GOLDEN STATE WARRIORS -122The Grizzlies gave the Warriors a fight last out. Enough to cover. In fact, Golden State is just 1-5 ATS against the Grizzlies in their last six games, and they're 2-5 ATS after one day of rest in their last seven. Before you lay the 2, get the trends.

Warriors have assembled a basketful of snipers and it is a good strategy. The Hawks have to figure out how to generate offense when the point guard and leading scorer is smothered.
