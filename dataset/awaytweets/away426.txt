üì∏: @DetroitPistons &amp; @GavinRhoades https://t.co/cI5nN908pf@telziah @GeorgeV_AFC @RjArsenalBlog When the Detroit Pistons went up against Michael Jordan and the Bulls in the late 80s ‚Äî their plan was to slow Jordan down by playing extremely physical defence. This helped them throw Michael off his game, and this, win in that era.

These were, the infamous, Jordan rules.@AG2000000 @TheMarkMathur @NBA @DetroitPistons Should've thrown Tree Rollins in there.@DetroitPistons @Pacers @BallySportsDET @WWJ950 @Shopify @GainbridgeFH No pistons fans really give a fuck fire Casey an make some better trades I have lost count on how many losses the pistons have not even going to waste my time watching them loose again#Pistons Mail Satchel: Where does state of rebuild rank among Detroit's pro teams?: https://t.co/hZHap4spyc https://t.co/9aKZuvznd0@DetroitPistons @Pacers @BallySportsDET @WWJ950 @Shopify @GainbridgeFH Tell Weaver to make a deal for Sabonis.

https://t.co/n6QU6mvXxr@rudyjuly2 @TheBukShow I am trying not to be too big a homer, but I do think the Pistons have all of the leverage. They don't have to trade him at all and there are a bunch of contenders who might want him. I think Detroit has to get at least one real NBA player back. I low-key like BojanAs we all know quiz players, the @NBA #NBA have had their fair share of very tall basketball players. Well, the #Pistons are no different in that fact.
