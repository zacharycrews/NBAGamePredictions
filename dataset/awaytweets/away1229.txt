Then that $44 gets split to the other 22 teams for $2 each.Utah Jazz are without Donovan Mitchell (illness non covid) and Bojan Bogdanovich (calf maintenance) tonight v. Portland@j3enos87 @dolfanshow Nice.  I remember seeing Boston play the Utah Jazz in early 1990s.  Kevin McHale didn't travel due to an injury.  Seeing Robert Parish, Larry Bird, Danny Ainge and Dennis Johnson was so awesome.  I can't remember who won.  The John Stockton &amp; Karl Malone years.@McCadeP8 @GrouchPotato20 @utahjazz Why is he paying $1000 to other teams??@utahjazz Sick maybe we’ll get some team basketball tonightUtah Jazz -17.5

This will be a beat down. Not only they can lock up the 5 spot, but I believe they’re looking to bounce back after a terrible loss to suns. Matchup nightmare and Portland is the ultimate fade ATS. #TakeNote

Seeing concepts this good in the purple scheme kills me. I’m not ready for what’s to come. ☹️BY THE WAY … today is the final regular season game for the current Jazz white jersey.
Jazz will have new jerseys next season
Of course this jersey could make an appearance during the 2022 playoffs

Dubs washing #UtahJazzUtah Jazz, LA Galaxy and Mitch Trubisky are trending today on Google. https://t.co/TKPkqlaMu7@MisterCBooz @utahjazz Any chance you could give 10 to 15 mins a night to this squad? The missing piece here is a force on the block. Need you big man.I don’t have many followers so this will fall on deaf ears but I believe in the @utahjazz!  I trust @spidadmitchell and @rudygobert27 to lead them to a great playoff run and even if they fall short, I’ll love this team and every player on it forever! #takenote@MaryannChierici @FollowingAlong8 @tiffanee_dawn @hansenjames Um, the #UtahJazz have double-digit leads for how many games?@noalsynoals @tiffanee_dawn Absolutely. 

Bojan was open repeatedly last night when iso Don was driving into traffic and either shooting a lower-percentage shot or (hearing the voices of angry fans) forcing a pass to Rudy

#UtahJazzNBA standings: Who will the Utah Jazz play in the playoffs? https://t.co/0xKtli6Siy@pow1105 @qqsheed @dane_dlsu @LegionHoops How many titles did the Jazz win? 

73-9 and and a win difference of over 10 points a game. If you think that Utah Jazz team was better than Golden st you are either 

36 years old or a Bulls fan 

Or you are from UtahOMG RSL gave up a late lead on Utah Jazz Night https://t.co/lXhD2Hy0BRUtah Jazz some ass@MisterCBooz @utahjazz Booze I loved your low post game and thought you and D-Will were missing one player from making a serious threat  But appreciate your years here and must say you had a lethal baseline jumper! Thanks Booz@Tricoloredpasta @RAZ0RFIST &gt;Purple looks bad

Classic Utah Jazz?

Sacramento Kings?

Even the Diamonback shit above proves thag wrong.

Vikinga Jerseys have always looked dope as well.@Jkush85 @utahjazz @PresMoss2 @utahjazzbear @Utah_Football @BuffaloBills Mike...  He's not weird!A wild game. Utah Jazz in all of its elements 🤐 https://t.co/b7qpuiq1dV@noalsynoals @tiffanee_dawn "Loosing", you say?

You were the one who were touting the #UtahJazz's #1 offense (or maybe "offence"); if it were really #1, couldn't it overcome whatever defects in the D--or at least score more than 13 points in the ENTIRE 4Q?

(All they needed was 19 to win)

#EnforceExcution“hey we should hold a Utah Jazz night, that would be fun.” https://t.co/y1omcUZYY5@MisterCBooz @utahjazz Great to see you Booz!This is fitting because it was Utah Jazz night at Rio Tinto. Also, RSL gave up what seemed to be a stable lead in the final 10 minutes of the game. 🤐🤐 https://t.co/qIsKwQ6XS8@utahjazz @oliviarodrigo carlos mf boozerTrail Blazers Game Notes: Portland Trail Blazers (27-54) vs. Utah Jazz (48-33) – NBA News https://t.co/qSPF8gWvHGTrail Blazers Game Notes: Portland Trail Blazers (27-54) vs. Utah Jazz (48-33) – https://t.co/QL2S6lDTAmPretty fitting that Real blew a lead on Utah jazz night https://t.co/EAZLdu8gmm#RSL doing their best to imitate the jazz on @utahjazz night! #TakeNoteWe win if this wasn’t Utah jAzz night. https://t.co/q6g78J0DJ7@MisterCBooz @utahjazz Love you, Booz!If you…

Then follow my guy @colby_colonel 👇 https://t.co/DYMbLRshYPRepped @DeGodsNFT hard at the @utahjazz game last night. Got the DeadGod up on the Jumbotron!! @frankdegods https://t.co/s5bA6WdZnC@sofiasunss think she meant the @utahjazz needed a good humbling. And a humbling is what they got last night. Good job @Suns see y'all tomorrow at the @FootprintCNTR LET'S GO!!!!!!!Best way to have the RSL game be Utah Jazz night is to end up losing this game in the last 6 minutes.Jazz look to wrap up No. 5 seed with win over Blazers  #NBA

Honoring the Jazz by blowing a lead late in the game. #Synergy@JacobCHatch #RSL's Herrera and Wood are like #UtahJazz's Gobert and Mitchell in clutch time--oh wait@noalsynoals @tiffanee_dawn If you're fine with 39% Bojan shooting it in the clutch, then you should be fine with 42% Juancho man
