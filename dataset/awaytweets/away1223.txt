Lonzo/AC + Gobert p&amp;r defense combo would be nice, though.Bucks vs Bulls in round 1

Then again I'm not rooting for the Bulls and I'm from Chicago so there goes that1. Dolphins (massive divide to number 2) 
2. Oakland A’s. 
3. Utah Utes 
4. ISU Bengals

6. New Jersey Devils. https://t.co/2H36FoNUZNReally disagree with Sixers' decision to rest Embiid/Harden tonight. Worth going all out for a chance at playing Bulls in the 1st round rather than Raptors. Chicago much less of a matchup problem, and you avoid the handicap of Thybulle's anti-vax nonsense.

#NBATwitter #NBA75 #NBATopShotThis https://t.co/IxQsBw3l8DOn this date, Apr 10th in 1999-

The Bulls lost 82-49 to the Heat. The 49 points by Chicago are the fewest points scored by an NBA team since the introduction of the shot clock prior to the 1954-55 season. 

Chicago’s 18 field goals made is also an NBA record-low.

This is huge!🎉🤍@gabrielayuso @chicagobulls …to the next generation of fans without requiring someone like Michael. A ton of assuming on my end, but I think that the team realizes the artists they’re working with can build a steady loyalty to the franchise for neutral fans who have no current NBA allegiance.@BIGALNFT @chicagobulls @Deadfellaz NICE!!@ClaireSilver12 @chicagobulls @Coinbase_NFT congratulations!@gabrielayuso @chicagobulls This is a great thought and thread. My best guess is that the Bulls have signed a bunch of talented artists to showcase a medium that their next wave of fans is generally invested in: digital. The Bulls realize a more intentional focus on digital art = an easier connection…When Friedkin gets his turn front and centre in "Easy Riders, Raging Bulls", Peter Biskind sets the scene with a quick, carefully phrased intro noting the lower-income area of Chicago Friedkin came from.

 #ChicagoBulls #NBAChicago Bulls will have the #18th pick in the 2022 NBA Draft.

While it's a very real possibility we may trade this pick after the draft, if we keep it, who do you want to take with the #18 pick?@RTFKTstudios im hearing rumors about @chicagobulls looking to make a NFT collection on @Coinbase_NFT ...when colab with Jordan?Wen @chicagobulls x @ToyBoogers for @Coinbase_NFT?  👀 https://t.co/UQT4oJLEpI@ClaireSilver12 @chicagobulls @Coinbase_NFT Congratulations 🎉🍷⚔️ https://t.co/uA5wvc9rmSNBA playoffs start in a few days, yet I'm thinking my Bulls will be a 1st rd exit. Injuries, and the @chicagobulls never addressing our "lack luster defense, especially at PF and Center, made me lose hope 🤷🏽‍♂️Ok.
