Miami Heat - Brooklyn Nets
Tip: Brooklyn Nets @ 1.79

The line shifted as it provided too much value on the Nets. The Heat has struggled in the last three games and the back to back will not help. The Nets have too much offense and should take the win here.🏀NBA🏀

The Nets are coming of a disappointing 132-120 loss to the Memphis Grizzlies.🔥

Irving- “There’s no way I’m leaving my man #7 anywhere.” https://t.co/HN8fS3xa7f@celticsforum But the standings are too packed and too fluid to avoid facing the Nets. The Cavs or Bulls may drop down to the play-in tournament. Toronto could move up. Have you seen the standings for those 3 teams? It's not guaranteed that Brooklyn would face Toronto in the 7-8 play-in game.@celticsforum The thing is Brooklyn can't try to avoid any team. The ambition is to make the playoffs. Celtics on the other hand are playoff confirmed. Thus, Celtics and other top teams can only do the avoiding and not Brooklyn nets that is scrambling to make the playoffs. Do you get?@Oladudu_Nil @celticsforum Agreed, the standings are too tightly packed and too fluid to try and position yourself away from playing Brooklyn. Just get the 1 seed, and the luck of that may be to not have to face the Nets in the 1st round. 🤷🏾‍♂️@dcwriter360 @itsjwills @MiamiHEAT @GraysonJAllen @BrooklynNets Lol you said class and Grayson Allen in the same sentence, your team is overrated and lame, go sit down 🛋️710 POD:

Brooklyn Nets -3.5

Miami looks atrocious and Brooklyn needs to win this game. Curry is back and should help them with more options. https://t.co/7DEP8TLKRU💰 Chelsea are likely to be sold for highest ever price paid for a sports franchise
💰 More than 20 parties have made bids to buy club from Roman Abramovich
💰 It's expected #CFC will be sold for £3bn, a sum that would beat the £2.5bn paid for the Brooklyn Nets

@mjshrimper https://t.co/O7DcpqmRk8@NetsKingdomAJ @ArtOfNova_ @KDTrey5 @KyrieIrving @BrooklynNets Nah not a big fan of that one@celticsforum They scored 120 because they have arguably 2 of the best scorers at their positions. Once they get going - it’s hard to stop em. Brooklyn also got 54 from JT. I hear being diplomatic - BUT you might be the only worried about da Nets pimp. Maybe you should start @Netsforum.@BrooklynNets @HSpecialSurgery What is the story on Simmons?  Been out all year now he has a sore back keeping him out? Also heard on a broadcast he has a slipped disk or something. Makes me wonder if he’s been keeping in shape while he been out all year.Kyrie Irving says he will re-sign with Brooklyn Nets this offseason
https://t.co/k7FxMtI0Mj@NetsKingdomAJ @ArtOfNova_ @KDTrey5 @KyrieIrving @BrooklynNets I miss the coogi jerseys 😔@ceasaleoXL @itsjwills @MiamiHEAT Not gonna happen. We have class. All our top players except maybe @GraysonJAllen is a nice guy on and off the court. Unlike the tacky, dirty @MiamiHEAT. @BrooklynNets is gonna clobber them tonight.@Oladudu_Nil @celticsforum Agreed, but what if the Bulls or Cavs drop down to the play-in games? They're only 1 game up on Toronto. The Bulls and Cavs have been fading. If Brooklyn beats one of those teams in the play-in game, the Nets become the 7th seed and then play the 2 seed. That could be Miami. 😆@BrooklynNets please mop the floor with the heat tonight, respectfully.🚨 Line Change 🚨
