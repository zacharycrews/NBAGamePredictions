Bet here: https://t.co/ECPrLfNSnt https://t.co/vqrHSoVgGS@gjjjnb3 @warriors The team is solid from top to bottom. But it's so bad to focus on a guy scoring 30 in a loss cuz it kinda makes the loss ok and you never wanna do that. I play city League ball and I get mad at my teammates if we win big but get careless at the end of games..@ekrup @CuseMilitia I agree that ACC refs are notoriously terrible.  Duke may be the better team, but Syracuse was the better team in that first half.  They looked more like the Golden State Warriors out there.  And in my opinion, Boeheim out coached Coach K in that first half.Warriors: Golden State #Warriors have one of NBA's best young cores - Blue Man Hoop https://t.co/tIXTtKdarQ@Lakebrown3 Golden State Warriors before Midkerr ffsWe’ve seen Shaq, Kobe, Allen Iverson and Damian Lillard all take stabs at doing music.

I might have to go with them I've always like that golden state broom@Reusiky My guy these are tough times. Good thing I've been a golden state warriors fan since birth. So if things get wilder I have something to fall back on@theboylexx @warriors As long as Curry and Thompson stay fit
The younger players are stepping up
Next season they should cook sha
Iguodala and Green as well
Poole, Wiggins, Moody
Decent team
Not star studded@smhgoofys @Lakers In the name of bucks fans I kindly reject your offer, I'll pass this one to the golden state warriors@Forty4_Forty4 @warriors 💔
But in the long run how good are they as a team ?@theboylexx @warriors I'm a warriors fan

Just move your emotions to the Phoenix Suns
Warriors have lost 4 of their last 5 matches

Even the out of form Lakers beat us
But we can't drop out of the top eight
We'd most likely make the playoffs but form has dipped ridiculously
So.... Don'tHow are the @warriors doing in the NBA?? https://t.co/5UWMg9iapd@markdavids200 @JorexLol @warriors @NBA So you choosed to be a noname, living a noname live and post „i could have been…“ on the internet.

Congrats Champ - been a long time coming! https://t.co/pEyS0vFVgQHi Bill, I think there are 2 major concerns the @warriors need to address: 1. Playing aggressive defense for 48 mins, specially in the 4th. 2. Setting strong picks/screens for Steph &amp; Klay. Kuminga issue is minor.

The NBA without the focus on the @warriors is like the PGA without @TigerWoods … 🤷🏼‍♂️@JohnetteDHardy1 @warriors I had a blast but my niece also told me some horrible school news. She said not only do they not teach History at her school, but for Black History month they studied "1" person for Dr King i made sure i was clear about what i was asking her "Uncle i know what 1, is"🏀 NBA MULTI 🏀

Two-leg multi with BIG VALUE coming around the @warriors &amp; Steph Curry. Take a look 👇

#DubNation  #NBAAllStar@Isaac_Rivals @nbagleague @BigTicket_JW @NBA @GLeagueWarriors @warriors It’s a shame! Hopefully the warriors will trade him in the off season. Would be great with a young core!That Warriors/Nuggets game tomorrow night is big for the #Grizzlies as Green is on his way back and Golden State’s schedule lightens up a little bit afterwards. I got a feeling the Dubs get them this time as they lost short handed out there the other night but an L would be nice.1st certain Americans were complaining bout leaving Afghanis to be harmed by the Taliban. Then other Americans were complaining about Golden State Warrior's owner saying "nobody cares about the Uyghurs" in China, although what he was really saying is he cares about AMERICANS 1st.@blakecm97 @nbagleague @BigTicket_JW @NBA @GLeagueWarriors @warriors They absolutely have the utmost interest in developing him. That’s why they hired Milojević. They are just prepping him by getting him heavy reps in Santa Cruz before he has to face the top players in the world. Makes perfect sense to me. The guy is coming off a yr-long injury.SOUTHERN MISS/FL ATLANTIC U135.5 (1U)🏀❌
