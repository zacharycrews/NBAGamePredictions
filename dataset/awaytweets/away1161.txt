#LetEmKnow | @SerenaWinters https://t.co/codGeS4NmE@tyler_zaire @cavs @keybank tonight? we play in 5 minutesI’m going back to listening to @cavs on the radio because tv rights restrictions in sports are out of pocket.@DevaronPerry I would enter, but if Garland had 3 bad games in a row, I feel @cavs twitter would be talking about him needing to be traded.

  So it is hard to know which jerseys to buy, because  this flip flopping #cavsfanbase, hates everyone at some point in a season.

https://t.co/Kn6B9gKUoG@SexIandCAVS Cleveland fans are the saddest fans in all of sports, moment there is a bump in the road, they all jump ship.

Please stay away from @Guardians for a bit.

Would be nice to enjoy them like we did the @cavs, before the venom migrated from complaining about the @Browns.

#GoCavsThanks for advice @JRCherry3 have plans on top of plans that's💯 what's up @egoldie80 @j_klimack20 that's funny @egoldie80 thanks for laugh and @JRCherry3 hey tell @cavs or what's it's called g leauge let me know about I still can hoop thanks 😁@cavsalcorn @cavs @DetroitPistons @RMFieldHouse @chones22 Tim.

Plant a Tree,

For EVERY attempted 3

We all are. Injuries have hit at the absolute worst time. Still so much to be proud of w/ the @cavs! @AmicoHoops &amp; I make sense of their struggles &amp; why the future is still very bright on our latest @CavsOnTheBreak pod. Give it a listen 😉! @PressPlayPods https://t.co/n7UV57UpJt@BalrogRed @cavs @SociosUSA I expect him to sit bench where he belongs. If you watch him play defense he looks like a deer in the headlights. You can literally see him say oh shit. I'd rather  see more Stevens than him. At least he can defend some and doesn't try to dribble up against 3 players losing ball@WeAreCavsNation @dariusgarland22 The @Cavs signing @dariusgarland22 before @CollinSexton02 would be a slap in the face. @_bigjayy_  and @evanmobley are the game changers.

 I don't know what the next part is, but you know what is funny the Team is still playing right now and you are talking about next year?

 Kind of making my point for me? hahaha

 #GoCavs@roger24ja @cavs @betwayusa 2nd tweet i’ve seen from you hating on JB, can y’all quit finding one person to blame when things go wrong, shit is so annoying and just dumb@jeffwltrs @Edible14 @MrStark_42 @DevaronPerry @cediosman @cavs This is twitter, you are not supposed to know.

 You are the one who came here in your feelings of despair and "the other shoe is going to drop"

You are getting exactly what you have craved, something to be upset about.

 This season started off well and you could not stand it.@216kobraEli @SportsTrumpATL @cavs Metro Atlanta is literally 3x larger than Metro Cleveland. Cleveland a dump. Atlanta is an elite city in the entertainment/media world with the world's busiest airport. Allstar game in Cleveland was a joke. It was poppin in the A.There’s no doubt in my mind the @cavs would be a top 3 team in the East if @CollinSexton02 @rickyrubio9 @_bigjayy_ and @evanmobley didn’t get hurt. If they can come back healthy for playoffs, Cavs a good sleeper pick to the finals. Next year full team, they gonna be scary@Oh__Cleveland @cavs @MarkkanenLauri @Huntington_Bank Right lol@cavs @MarkkanenLauri @Huntington_Bank Why are all the Cleveland stadiums named after companies whose bills I hate paying every month?
