I dont even give a F about the Texans but this post gave me major Bill Simmons/Windhorst #Rockets vibes. https://t.co/J0u7Jc40CTBrooks didn't shoot the ball well in 43 games with the Rockets this season (30% from 3), but he hit 38% of his 3s on a high volume (7.9 attempts per game) in Houston last year and is a 39% 3-point shooter in 59 G League games over 3 seasons.✨ Famous Followers

★ Don't excite you with their style of play.

★ Have a dominant post player

★ Have shooters around their dominant post player

★ Are taken for granted
