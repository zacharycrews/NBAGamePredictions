Bet slip link: https://t.co/xUuTDBlpl9 https://t.co/3oBEa60h6o11/27/91 – A day after losing 104-89 at SAC, the Phoenix #Suns routed the Kings in PHX, 141-100. Rookie Tim Perry scored a career-high 25p w/7r/2a. KJ had 22p/13a/5s &amp; Jeff Hornacek had 20p/8a/5s. The loss was SAC's first after snapping a 43-game road losing streak. #ValleyProud https://t.co/ymBmcaN974Suns gonna take the W tonight against Brooklyn. Let’s goo! #phoenixsuns@Suns Bing Bong??@KnicksMemes @Suns They have bigger fish to fry.Despite the Lakers being 10-11 we are still somehow the 7th seed in the western conference. On pace to play who in the playoffs??? The Phoenix Suns.Can’t wait to peep a @Suns game 😁👀@arxanii The Suns just became playoff caliber last season. So Harden’s record and performance against the present day iteration of the Phoenix Suns would look very different. This is a completely remade team now.When you are joyful, when you say yes to life and have fun and project positivity all around you, you become a sun in the center of every constellation, and people want to be near you.

Keep going. https://t.co/CdtxPqKL6RThe Phoenix Suns worst 5 man lineup point differential wise is when DeAndre Ayton is in the lineup. 

The Suns playoff run made Ayton seem much more important than he actually is. Javale McGee has been much better than him this season. https://t.co/j968oX1mVF¡Partidazo en la #NBAxESPN!

Of course, they shot well from the floor (.557), but it's only the third game in their history where they've had 1 or less offensive rebounds in a game.And likewise, her Phoenix is based off of the Moebius FF but with some changes such as magatama in the elemental wheel colours/aspects surrounding the sun on its back. https://t.co/qs4wm42vrc@SportsCenter @Suns But please @espn and @SportsCenter , just keep going on and on about that team in LA LA land@angelinams112 @Suns @suns_tutu_fan @SunsSquad86 @KevinArnett19 💜🧡💜🧡💜🧡

Winning time. !!!! @Suns https://t.co/bj4DYr8ph1@JBurs13 @NBA @Suns @nyknicks 🤣🤣🤣 I’m keeping this for sure bruhhhSuns still up on the Knicks heading into the fourth 88-71. 

New York made an early run and they're moving the ball better, but Phoenix just keeps hitting big shots. Booker is torching everyone. 

Booker: 32 PTS, 4-9 3Ps
Ayton: 10 PTS, 10 REBS
Crowder: 11 PTS, 3-4 3Ps@Suns Funny how much the refs were helping the Knicks at the first half of the 3rd Quarter. But, our guys keep fighting and Book holy crap.@Suns Last years obvious coach of the year vs some below average Knicks coachEnd of the 3rd Quarter:

Suns: 88
Knicks: 71

Phoenix continuing to hit big shot after big shot preventing New York from making any runs. Booker remains dominant for the Suns with 32 points.

Respect to you @DevinBook ! Really making her day it’s the small things that count🙌Knicks just aren’t in the same league as the Suns. They’re more athletic and have better shooters. Phoenix offense getting dribble penetration at will and shooting so well. Booker is elite. Knicks offense is stagnant and they’re missing open looks. https://t.co/imom3T7C9FThe Suns have won 14 straight and looking to make it 15 tonight vs. the Knicks. 

Phoenix is currently +1400 to win the title. Good or bad bet?
https://t.co/nLZZHcVJDCseparately, in beyond bizarre stats - according to the Suns series noted: Phoenix holds a 68-64 lead in the all time matchup, retaking the lead at 65-64, their first time leading the series since their first franchise matchup ever. In 1968. 

weird wow@IT_JI13 @Suns Ehh not reallycan we get @stephenasmith to finally acknowledge @Suns if they destroy his teamThe @Suns are just the more well-rounded team. There’s a reason they’re 14-3.

Suns culture@Suns Great start 🏀👍👏🏼💜🧡😊@Suns COMMON W FROM THE SUNSSuns lead 33-27 after 1. A quick 11 points in 12 minutes for Devin Booker, while Evan Fournier has nine points to lead New York. Both teams started out hot, with Phoenix shooting 14-for-22 and the Knicks going 9-for-18, including 4-for-6 from 3.Suns lead the Knicks after the first period 33-27.

New York can't handle the pick and roll right now. Everyone on Phoenix is finding space to score when they attack with it. Could be a long night for NY if they don't adjust.

Booker: 11 PTS, 5-9 FGs
Ayton: 8 PTS, 4-4 FGsIs it me or has @DevinBook 's improved significantly? 🤔.
