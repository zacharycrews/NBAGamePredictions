(+)@sarahrimmington @GregSylvander Sarah's bio says she tweets alot about the Toronto Raptors. 

I think it might need an edit to 'I tweet alot about Kyle Lowry on the Miami Heat'

Good to see you following the team and our new All-Star so intently. Welcome ☺️The Toronto Raptors have the 3rd best defence in the NBA in terms of Points Per Game (100.3 PPG)

Gary Trent Jr is 4th in the NBA averaging 2.8 Steals Per GameIndiana Pacers - New York Knicks
Cleveland Cavaliers - Portland Trail Blazers
Orlando Magic - Boston Celtics
Philadelphia 76ers - Chicago Bulls
Washington Wizards - Toronto Raptors

Bet slip link: https://t.co/y0dG0x4ZqQ https://t.co/ludP7O4QH9The Raptors are 1st in the NBA with 22.6 deflections per game. The second place Sixers (18.9) are closer to 14th than 1st.

1st in loose balls recovered, top two individual players for deflections, 1st in OREB%. 

No one hustles like the Toronto Raptors this season.Monday night belonged to OG and Gary but Fred VanVleet quietly had 17p/9r/8a.

The fact the man had a near triple-double with 1 turnover and it wasn't even the biggest story of the night speaks to the depth and potential of a fully healthy Toronto Raptors team.Drakes wants a WNBA team in Toronto. They have the Toronto Raptors already. What could they name the Women’s team? https://t.co/xg1SShZIAwTonight the Wizards are back at home and will debut their new City Edition Uniforms as they host the Toronto Raptors #DCAboveAll https://t.co/MjurJhuxIa@MagicEightBal Will the Toronto Raptors win tonight against the Wizards?So ppl really called the raps bottom of the East.. but they are proving just the opposite. Would be so fun to go against Boston in the first round and sweep them. Hot take of the day but raptor propaganda is overtaking. #torontoraptors #Playoffs #WeTheNorth #RaptorsIt’s Toronto #Raptors GAMEDAY!

And achiuwa is a project.

If hes the starting C in 3 years thats a W.Great game by the Toronto Raptors against the Knicks, cohesive defensive effort by the team. Particularly impressed by Birch protecting the paint, OG showing improvement in his offensive game. Trent Jr always dangerous from deep &amp; showed hunger defensively@SportsCentre416 @WhyThoBoucher @witcan74 @mooo2457870 @walsha @BlueJays @Raptors @packers What “issue” are you referring to?  That sexual predators exist?  I’d suggest it’s fair that issue filters all the way thru society. The whole “anti hockey culture” movement is ludicrous. The biggest problem actually facing hockey today is the financial strain on parents@MrChuckD @Bucks @NBA @Raptors League doing the same with the Jazz as well 🤦🏻‍♂️🔥 HOT STREAKS!
