Houston has gone UNDER 11 straight games since 2-2017 off a win where they allowed at least 125 points.

A lot of that is because CP is amazing.

The card was amazing and his beard was something special for us. So we watched youtube videos of him and became big fans. So I was a Harden Fan - becoming a Houston Rockets Fan and stayed with it 🤘🏻🚀@midrangehoops Houston has been playing well. I really love their big man Alperen Sengun. The Rockets beat Brooklyn and the Pacers recently. I will not be shocked if they beat the Knicks.

So much effort and love for the RocketsFor those who hate James Harden, a very common answer I get when asking that question is that James Harden made them a fan of Houston sports. 

But shouts out to all the foreign fans who stay up late or wake up early to watch the Rockets play.
