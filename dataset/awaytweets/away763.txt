Crazy value over on the Golden State Warriors side. (D. Murray should have an easier matchup aswell)My fellow @warriors fans can be infuriating. C'mon, we're going to the playoffs; that's clear at this point. That's when the real party gets started. So until then, stop worrying about when @Money23Green comes back, or if @StephenCurry30 is in a slump etc. We got this.

#NBA #NBAxESPN #ESPNCaribbean https://t.co/Z1pwcO8GJO@DogSurfRoadshow @StephenCurry30 @warriors I think he should be in the MVP discussion this year. His defense is much better now than in 2014-15. But to be fair, he’s FAR less efficient so far this season. His TS% that year was 63.8%. This year it’s 58.6%. That’s the difference between elite and league average efficiency.@warriors @Garydwayne God

It’s unbelievable how these refs officiate. They are trained to give some teams calls, and the others no calls.This game was 5 points away from being the worst jinx of my life.

They went from looking like a bunch of bums playing pick-up at the YMCA in the first half to the 2017 Golden State Warriors in the second.

I mean: turn-around step-back, turn-around fade-away, and a bunch of back-to the basket creation. Sometimes, it’s like watching Kobe. His bag is 🔥@warriors@TonyCaminada @warriors I was wondering if you went!
