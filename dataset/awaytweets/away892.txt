Not even close. Houston supports the Texans and Astros more than the Rockets, and Cleveland is definitely a Browns town with the baseball team in second.After an extended All-Star break, the Rockets resumed on-court activities with a Wednesday night practice in Houston. Here’s a look at what they’re working on, along with health updates.  https://t.co/iNKeig9pFJ@Embiid_prodzz The Houston Rockets should move to Las VegasThe Houston Rockets Luc Monte had a six pack of budlight for breakfast on game day.@BabyYogurt_ @BBallBecka @Embiid_prodzz Houston Rockets

Yeah they could probably do 3 teams like they have for the last several decades.@bob3919 @esco1156 @brooklynnets85 False.  Rockets picks from Nets: 2022, 24, 26.  Swaps are 2023, 25, 27. They have Ben, this or next years pick from Philly, and 2027.  It’s net 1 draft pick. Where will Houston be 3 or 5 years from now? If you think you know, you don’t know basketball at all. Marks&gt;Morey.@BenDuBose It's going to be a great feeling when both the Houston Texans and Houston Rockets are winning at the same time in a year or two. Times have been tough for two seasons in a row but it won't stay that way forever. A couple  strong drafts in a row. Good free agents. The turnaround!Houston rockets fans: NO IT ISNT https://t.co/64jdiA8KxjRemember the WHA Houston Aeros did outdraw the Rockets back in the 70s.
