It’s fitting that the meal we’re having is from a restaurant which sounds similar to the Toronto Raptor who surely helped me reach this milestone following in the first place.@DreamShake_R @CMcElhinney @nbatopshot @roham @Boards2Buckets @TheJurassicPack @RichDMC @Eisenberg43 @Raptors @HustlinShowroom @WolfPackWW @rippackscity @NineLivesLounge @TopShotKingdom @ElDumboTS Lemmie get in the lab tomorrow.

And would be amazed by a partnership with a female sports team. Think OVO and the Toronto Raptors.

I think you did wonders to help kill the oversupply.

As I always say to others, I like you because you keep it real.

We're all better for you bitching about the oversupply (even if he's a pretty decent player) 👌🏻
