Usually, it would be risky to take a team off a back to back going from Chicago to Atlanta. However, the Hawks are absolutely decimated by Covid adding John Collins and Delon Wright to the their Covid list.

But are they the Bulls?

Seem more aligned to 90's Utah Jazz (title change 'Last Chance'?).

Messed up that the NBA is going to force Atlanta to play with 11 players in protocol but that's what they are doing.  Trash@Derozan46 @chicagobulls @NBCSChicago @NBATV @670TheScore W hopefully we get these 2 wins@merosskimball @chicagobulls “MJ and Pippen will be there, we should go”

“Nah.. I’m good”

“Also Will Purdue”

“Lets leave immediately”@SteveBookit @chicagobulls @steve thank you! It’s great to see the hate come from someone with such a small following. Keep disappointing@JRodriguez_1521 @chicagobulls @NBCSChicago @NBATV @670TheScore It’s not the Hawks coach said they will have 10-11 guys and it’s going to be played@chicagobulls @NBCSChicago @NBATV @670TheScore let's go for the 21st? I have faith that if#Pacers rookie Chris Duarte has proven he can score, but against the Bulls he was also “thrown in the fire” and accepted the challenge of guarding Chicago’s dynamic duo, Zach LaVine and DeMar DeRozan.

https://t.co/JHfbTrKNJSGloomy day. At least the @chicagobulls play today 😤@Shisnoh @chicagobulls @SarahSpain @ZachLaVine Wiggins's was in his last year also and the wolves ended up giving him a 5 year max deal just a couple months after the trade. Lavine wasn't going to get near a max deal coming off his ACL injury which was another reason I wanted to keep him over Wiggins.@jdizzle513 @ImDeported @NolanSnyder12 @RJackie2021 @wustdontmiss @statmuse @ZachLaVine @chicagobulls In the finals he had 3 bad games and 3 good ones and he shot bad from 3. Thats why I said he was inconsistent.When you get Christmas presents to watch @ZO2_ play, but he gets ruled out on game day with covid :(.  @bigballerbrand @chicagobulls #JBA —&gt; #NBA https://t.co/Nx8Fmq1UZj@chicagobulls @ZachLaVine 🗣MVP!

He played bad in the second game even before the injury. I didn’t say he wasn’t good I said he played bad which he did. My first comment was a response to the dude saying “So ur telling me booker didn't play good?”GAME DAY: The Bulls will look to extend their winning streak as they travel to play the Atlanta Hawks.  Can the Bulls make it 4 in a row? Let us know your thoughts and predictions… GO BULLS! #GAMEDAY #BullsNation #chicagobulls https://t.co/ha4Yf9VOCNMonday, December 27th

Bulls -5 

Chicago is 4-2 in their last six. Lavine has scored over 30 points in three out of last four games. Hawks top players out.

Nets -4 

Nets are 4-1 in last five. Harden &amp; Mills will lead the way against a shortened roster for Clippers@statmuse @most_average_ @ZachLaVine @chicagobulls Wilt Chamberlain had 65 consecutive games over 30 pts and 14 consecutive over 4o pts.@seanseaevans @chicagobulls Demar on hot ones plz@thatman578 @95tilinfinity10 @ImDeported @wustdontmiss @statmuse @ZachLaVine @chicagobulls Not a stat watcher, all Zach and demar do is score they avg only 4 ast a game while cp3 leads the league with 10. For example, butler is a better version of demar he can score and get to the ft line while also being a top 3 defensive wing and an elite playmaker he avg 6 assists@Cripple55 @chicagobulls I'd rank them in the East as follows: 
1. Bucks 
2. Nets (with Kyrie)
3. Bulls 
4. Heat 
5. Cavs
6. 76ers (higher w/ Simmons)
7. Hawks
8 Celtics
9 Hornets 
10 Wizards

They're only option it seems would be to play zone.

I don't see them getting through Embiid, Durant, &amp; Giannis.@WinamaxSport le MyMatch sur le match Atlanta Hawks vs Chicago Bulls sera disponible ou pas ?@AhuraCuh @chicagobulls @ZachLaVine Dude is an absolute bucket@chicagobulls Trop beau 😻NBA Player DD. Date: 12-27 Clint Capela

Happens to be exactly what you are doing lmao@HagenTroy @chicagobulls @SarahSpain @ZachLaVine I think it also had to do with their contracts. Zach only had like 1 year left I think@HughBalls5 @ImDeported @NolanSnyder12 @RJackie2021 @wustdontmiss @statmuse @ZachLaVine @chicagobulls Bro, you are literally doing that, focusing only on his worst series performance, where he had basically one bad stat (38%). He played well in the series before that too lol, and his stats in the finals are good. Regardless, saying he isn’t a good player is idiocyToday's NBA Consensus (So Far):

Charlotte Hornets 77%
Brooklyn Nets 72%
Phoenix Suns 65%
Portland Trail Blazers 64%
Chicago Bulls 63%
Minnesota Timberwolves 63%
San Antonio Spurs 53%Chicago Bulls -5.5

The signings of Caruso &amp; Ball, and the need of some more size due to the loss of PF/C Patrick Williams for the year it would make sense that the Bulls would be looking for a trade partner.🏀 Oklahoma City Thunder def.

Because Detroit stopped them@SenpaiGeeze @catspoopinboxes @ZachLaVine @statmuse @chicagobulls and it proved that style did not equate in to winning basketball. MJ had his best year statistically and career and he said he did not want to be that type of player. He could have avg'd Lebron numbers his entire career he deferred that part of his game to Pippen after 88' season@SenpaiGeeze @catspoopinboxes @ZachLaVine @statmuse @chicagobulls see thats the point the triangle offense wasn't predicated around Lebron James type playstyle not many offenses are for that matter. Everyone touches the ball and Pippen's utilization rate would be higher means they're not as efficient. MJ did the year prior to Pippen avg 32/8/8@escott1028 Chicago Bulls only have one player out so the game is happened.

Pick: Chicago Bulls -5.5 (-110) 5u

Bulls are set for a back to back which is not ideal, but they are in much better shape than the Hawks health wise. Bulls are 5-2 ats their last 7 against the Hawks. This could get ugly, lay the points.Consensus Line Move:

Everybody with cmon sense knows this. 

That meant Jordan was going to drop from 30 to 25 or whatever and MJ being selfish and self absorbed didn't want that.

That doesn't change the fact he dominated my Lakers man@WizardsMafia @catspoopinboxes @ZachLaVine @statmuse @chicagobulls The fact that you have to compared Jordan getting assistance from Scottie to Scottie who constantly passed him the ball is another L. 

It's too early for you to be taking all these Ls@WizardsMafia @catspoopinboxes @ZachLaVine @statmuse @chicagobulls I lost the argument by throwing in facts? 

Jordan without Pippen couldn't get past the first round. That's a fact you tryna ignored.

Lol@SenpaiGeeze @catspoopinboxes @ZachLaVine @statmuse @chicagobulls I see you lost the argument. I love how you clowns like to prop up Pippen like he was this superstar next to MJ 😂

A great weekend in Chicago 😤 https://t.co/h6OnhwVQlC@NBATV @chicagobulls Why Kevin Durfraud is not the top 100 all time?
1. KDisney made the weakest move in NBA history because he blew a 3-1 lead and shot 10-31 in a game.
2. Kevin Durfraud has 0 all defensive teams/isn’t clutch

Nikola Vucevic had 16 points, 15 rebounds, and 2 blocks.

The Bulls are 20-10!BEARS WIN 🐻 
BULLS WIN #Bullsnation 

Period Chicago!!! 😎✨Pacers never got a handle on the Bulls’ playmakers (LaVine, DeRozan) and shot poorly from outside (27%) in a 113-105 loss in Chicago. LeVert went for 27/9a. Turner had 19.

With just 3 of 13 December games on the road, they went 0 for 3.

Up next: v Hornets on Wed.Bulls win? 
Bears win? 
Oh yeah good night in Chicago.

I know he has a lot of great stories and insight to tell. Make this happen Sean!@SeeingLotsOfRed @NBCSBulls @chicagobulls The “joke” was that Bulls PA intro’d him as from USC.

Very balanced game on both sides. Nikola Vucevic, who did not play the last time Indiana was in Chicago, has a team-high 8 points.

Domantas Sabonis leads Indiana with 7 points.@KOT4Q @chicagobulls @seanseaevans Can you tell them to fish this defense please and thank you@chicagobulls @NBCSChicago @ZachLaVine Like the haircutNBA Leader: 25.6 PPG Chicago Bulls vs Indiana Pacers Live Call https://t.co/lheTsXuRAD https://t.co/feA8VJoofvAbsolutely love this @chicagobulls team omg@chicagobulls @goaawol Let’s go@jasonbenetti @chicagobulls Hi JB!
