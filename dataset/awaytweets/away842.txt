#LetEmKnow #NBA75 https://t.co/RdP6xKT2sp@RobOstrom @cavs My thoughts, too.

It would be nice to watch them simply coast end-to-end for a victory.The @nba is in a terrible situation because it‚Äôs getting to the point where it has to start talking about the @cleveland @cavs who have no superstars but just play the game of basketball as a TEAM. Ya know, the way it was meant to be played.@CLETommy @xigents @cavs @evanmobley i know, thats why I would have started rondo or even Goodwin, just to get our offense off to a good startMOOD ü§© @cavs @KenCarman #cavs https://t.co/MDxIXIpyHl@CLETommy @xigents @cavs @evanmobley But, you cant deny Mobley played like charmin in the first half and some of the 2nd half. He didnt play up to his expectations. I expected him to step up with our injured roster@utdrobbo @cavs This is the way@best_bupdatess @cavs He‚Äôs gonna have nights like this one for sure.

FIR THE @CAVS #LetEmKnow https://t.co/E2TwrcRUH5JB essentially played eight guys (ninth, Stevens, played just 8 minutes).

Good learning experience, but not a great idea if youre trying to win. In the end RR and CL's 1-2 punch won us the game. EM stepped up too@cavs @CarisLeVert Nahhh he dribbles to much that could be problematic for us in the near future. We only truly came back within the time he was benched in the 4th for like 7 minutes. I admit those last 4 minutes were amazing.

@CarisLeVert ü§ù @_bigjayy_ https://t.co/qxkSq1k8SOI swear everyone on this @cavs team is more comfortable shooting the ball purely because they know @_bigjayy_ will clean up anything they don‚Äôt hit. Guy just eats glass üò§ #LetEmKnow@cavs @CarisLeVert I‚Äôve said it for weeks now and today it shows. We need a true backup Center to relieve our boy JA. Wade is perfect for Love when he‚Äôs off or if he‚Äôs needed at the three. Lamar can get by at PF with his strength and forward size. We do not have a backup PAINT PRESENCE though.@NolaDezzy @FIizop @cavs @socios Usually happens when you don‚Äôt play the entire 2nd Q@cavs @socios Atleastwe cut the lead to make a comeback. Now Mobley needs to wake up or im gonna lose my shit@cavs @socios Keep going Go Cavs!@sabalabading @cavs @socios Hes so useless offensively@cavs @socios @dariusgarland22 only 22 yrs old and already suffering from recurrent back problems. https://t.co/2HAfBukwkfNBA Second Half

Cedi was also good in the only time he was on the court@sabalabading @cavs @socios Stevens is just a better Okoro, sadly we wont be in the rotation anymore@cavs @socios Okoro jumper is cooked man@icecoldmjc @cavs @socios Rondo should have started this game AND the last game against the pacers@King0fCleveland @cavs @socios I remember that stretch where he was shooting mid 40s from 3 ah what a amazing 6 game stretch had a crazy amount of blowouts during that time too@MiIlsWrld @cavs @socios That can be said for everybody except JA@cavs @socios Pacers gonna stop making 3 eventually. Good job getting back into the game@cavs @socios Clean up that D in the second half and we win this game.@cavs @socios Please Love teach Okoro how to shoot 3 thx mate@cavs @socios I smell a road W. Walking them boys down! 
#letemknow@sabalabading @cavs @socios Anything.  He needs to score 10-14 points a game. He‚Äôs been giving nothing offensively.@cavs @socios Our defense hasn‚Äôt even been that bad. The pacers just automatically want to be the best team in NBA history and make every single shot contested and uncontested@King0fCleveland @cavs @socios Dog bro you got me dying@cavs @socios Right back in the game step up the defense more hit some shots and try to get Mobley going as well and osman@cavs @socios The paces are literally just hucking that shit up lol. I think we‚Äôll be fine@ItsReallyMarkCM @cavs @kevinlove Feeling a bit better eh?@cavs @socios Maybe playing a dude who has been on the team for 5 days out of position as the starting point guard wasn't the best idea.@cavs @socios Can Okoro please for the love of God hit a corner 3@cavs @socios Calm down y'all, them pacers bois just playin good nothing to worry about.@cavs @socios Hot take but if the Pacers put up 74 next half i don't think the Cavs will win.@cavs @socios We‚Äôll be okay. Mobley just needs to wake up and the Pacers will cool off@cavs @socios Cmon boys lets get it done in the 2nd half@sabalabading @cavs @socios been waiting this for 2 years now@cavs @socios (Impossible, I know)@cavs @socios Trade Okoro for grant@cavs @socios Levert refuses to shoot open threes and why are we leaving guys open in the corner every damn play@TheClevelandEra @cavs @socios Shut up@cavs @socios Defense has to get stops down low, also I‚Äôm still not used to Okoros hair. Thought it was Goodwin out there lol.@cavs @socios We got back into it, keep the same energy in the second half@cavs @socios That was better@cavs @socios Hopefully Okoro and Mobley can get serious in the 2nd halfTf is this guy doing at the halftime show at the @cavs game üò≠üò≠üò£@cavs @socios Hopefully they stop being the best shooting team in the league@cavs Do 2 more quarters like this and you'll snatch the win, dont fkin colapse again@cavs @socios We need to get our shot together defensively.Y‚Äôall better come back and get that dub @cavs@cavs @socios If we could just get any kind of offense from Okoro this team would be scary goodIt's break time.

What changes have you made recently?

Undo whatever you did.

It is terrible.

Austin Carr's audio is especially terrible.@MiIlsWrld @cavs Still doesn'tDamn @cavs gave up 50 points in 1st QTR. wow. #LetEmKnowThe Cleveland Cavaliers are tied for the second best record in the Eastern Conference üòé@cavs Damn i misses a quarter and this happened.@CarisLeVert's bucket brings the @cavs' current run to 14-6.

Please get in contact with Jason Gibbs @BGSUGibbs and pay him whatever he asks to fix your audio.

Your audio for Cavs games is getting worse and worse.

Have you changed staff, equipment or software recently?

What are you doing?

What else can explain why he has no points or boards almost halftime. Did he forget what his job is?@CLETommy @cavs @evanmobley i dont think so considering how good we have played. But, I want to clarify: #1stroundsweepI don't know what the Bally Sports people are doing but your broadcast audio has been terrible in this game and for the past few games.

It is almost as if someone is purposely sabotaging your audio.
