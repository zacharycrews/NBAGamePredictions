It reminded me that it was in fact just another Magic tournament after all. hbd.3/2/00 – The Phoenix #Suns blew out the Indiana Pacers 118-87, the 31pt win, PHX's biggest ever over IND. Cliff Robinson had 22p while Jason Kidd had 6p/9r/15a. PHX had 21 fastbreak pts. IND: 0.

His punishment should be having to re-sign with the Indiana Pacers next year until he learns his lesson!  I wouldn’t even look at him other NBA Front Offices.
