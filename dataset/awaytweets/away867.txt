#NBAPick #bettingpicks #GamblingTwitter@KevinTroyGA @ATLHawks I don’t mind the yellow as an accent, but this mustard yellow as a main color instead of tertiary is just gross and not representing of Hawks ball imo. the black red, or even the OG navy/red gradient would’ve been sick.@MonTANA470 @ATLHawks Interesting. Would you have rather seen it in the black and red gradient? I like the occasional leaning into the yellow, especially since I yelled so hard for us to get it back / dump volt. 😅ok but why would the @ATLHawks plan the member fan fest for the same day &amp; time as #ATLUTD's home opener??Simply asking for a Tide hoops dub along with an Atlanta Hawks victory 🐘 🦅Atlanta Hawks (-5) @ Orlando Magic! #TrueToAtlanta #MagicTogether #NBA #NBATwitter #NBA75Atlanta Hawks Starters:

I think the Volt one is really well done (all of them, honestly), but many of us were so ready to get rid of Volt as a primary color it likely holds a negative space for us.
