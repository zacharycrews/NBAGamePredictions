Easiest hundo of my life 😂Even the Indiana Pacers got a player in that deal, being the Lakers draft pick in 2021, which they used on Isaiah Jackson. Whilst Isaiah Jackson is raw, being a rookie, he has a lot of potential, as he was a 5 star recruit in high school and played college at Kentucky.Sacramento Kings vs Indiana Pacers 11/7/21 Free NBA Pick and Prediction ... https://t.co/i5InMC1ztT via @YouTubePower Plays
