We should dictate the changes, not change to match the opponent.@Tjonesonthenba @utahjazz I know, but its the Clippers Series last year, we lost by not making changes.  I think that big ball is what the Jazz should have gone to.  Think 3-2 defense to help the perimeter defense.  Offensively nothing changes with 3 shooters, Conley, Mitchell and Bogey...@bakersdaniel @whohasskyemail @BGN_5 @utahjazz @Lakers Yet Magic improved upon the new prototype Oscar Robertson w/uncanny impact. Like I said before‚Ä¶playing amongst ATG‚Äôs Magic dominated games with NINE points‚Ä¶Stockton never did that! Magic extended Kareem‚Äôs career, made Wilkes, Worthy, Scott, AC Green, &amp; Cooper better@JefferyLakes @bakersdaniel @BGN_5 @utahjazz @Lakers @NBA Stockton was a better playmaker and defender than Magic, feel free to show me where anyone said he was a better overall player, Magic had hall of famers and never got close to any of his records

[FD(27.9) DK(29.5)]@utahjazz bogey is really good but he need to do this thing when we are going against good teams.FYI: This is the 3rd time Bojan Bogdanovic has made 8 3's in a game as member of the Utah Jazz. Ingles, Clarkson, Hood, Foye and Hornacek are the rest to do it with the #UtahJazz! #TakeNote@utahjazz Yeah let‚Äôs bring up last game and how he got dogged the whole game. You‚Äôre going against a rebuilding team who‚Äôs missing 2/3 of their factors. Prove to me that you won‚Äôt ever get embarrassed like the Pelicans game and then I‚Äôll consider calling y‚Äôall contenders@RealSkipBayless True üíØ even 1998 Utah Jazz older than 2022 Lakers.Bojan has 8 made three pointers now. This is the fourth time in his career he's made 8 in a game and it ties the #UtahJazz team record.
