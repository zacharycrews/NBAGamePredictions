We should dictate the changes, not change to match the opponent.@Tjonesonthenba @utahjazz I know, but its the Clippers Series last year, we lost by not making changes.  I think that big ball is what the Jazz should have gone to.  Think 3-2 defense to help the perimeter defense.  Offensively nothing changes with 3 shooters, Conley, Mitchell and Bogey...@bakersdaniel @whohasskyemail @BGN_5 @utahjazz @Lakers Yet Magic improved upon the new prototype Oscar Robertson w/uncanny impact. Like I said before…playing amongst ATG’s Magic dominated games with NINE points…Stockton never did that! Magic extended Kareem’s career, made Wilkes, Worthy, Scott, AC Green, &amp; Cooper better@JefferyLakes @bakersdaniel @BGN_5 @utahjazz @Lakers @NBA Stockton was a better playmaker and defender than Magic, feel free to show me where anyone said he was a better overall player, Magic had hall of famers and never got close to any of his records 

You’re a casual lmao@bakersdaniel @whohasskyemail @BGN_5 @utahjazz @Lakers Again, not hating on Stockton…a true ATG! Just destroying the misguided myth he rivals Magic for ATG @NBA PG! There are stats that tweak the eye test…yet fall under the floor where impact goes! He’s a great, typical (Cousy-esque) PG…an improved version on an original dinosaurIts Almost Game Time! @utahjazz @dallasmavs

The problem with that line up offensively was Rubio not being able to shoot.  Conley is obviously a huge upgrade.  What do the Jazz have to lose trying out a bigger lineup occasionaly?2u •Utah Jazz ML +116

Royce Oneale does a decent job defending Luka tonight &amp; Gobert dominates the glass.

Los Ángeles Clippers 93-116 New York KnicksI feel Luka Doncic should go Under 50.5 Pts+Reb+Ast in this matchup, but he may be inspired by his fellow Euro Star Nikola Jokic. Expecting a close game with Utah Jazz.

I feel Mike Conley should go Over his Pts+Ast of 17.5 but he fell short last game and has a lot of pressure.@Dutch_Oven45 @dallasmavs @utahjazz Didn’t you strike out with some chick in the 3rd aisle of the 3rd base side?

Honestly I would have had to look it up.@Dutch_Oven45 @Carlos_Rodon55 @dallasmavs @utahjazz No way! Ty Cobb barely EVER struck out! It’s entirely possible that Dutch might have struck out Cobb had he ever faced him but since Cobb only struck out a little over 5% of the time, Dutch would have had his work cutout for him.@Dutch_Oven45 @dallasmavs @utahjazz Aaron hill..lol I'm in ft worth I can goMULTI FUN NBA 🏀 :

I’ll give my two tickets away to them with the first one to respond with who my first major league strike out was…. Good luckI reviewed my Twitter today. My takeaway:
1) Trumpers+GOP praise Russia *ew*
2) LGBTQ+ and BYU… (yup)
3) Utah Jazz are🔥
4) I have some angsty friends 
5) Is it Freedom of Speech or Complaint? 🧐

You are a casual no matter how many games you want to say you been to, talking about “played longer” like that factors in to season records lmao 🤡🤡@whohasskyemail @BGN_5 @utahjazz @Lakers I saw Magic &amp; Stockton play in person several times so I’ve got your casual! Like I said you take Stockton for your never win anything team except when you play w/Magic team. Stockton excelled at playmaking in a system, Magic at improvising &amp; WINNING!@utahjazz Ah, Hell no@JefferyLakes @BGN_5 @utahjazz @Lakers Stockton was a better playmaker, he created shots for mediocre players who couldn’t create their own, Magic played with hofers since his rookie year

Bringing up “he played longer” means nothing when Stockton holds the record for most assists in a season, you mad casual 😂https://t.co/fFH8A6jmSa

[FD(27.9) DK(29.5)]@utahjazz bogey is really good but he need to do this thing when we are going against good teams.FYI: This is the 3rd time Bojan Bogdanovic has made 8 3's in a game as member of the Utah Jazz. Ingles, Clarkson, Hood, Foye and Hornacek are the rest to do it with the #UtahJazz! #TakeNote@utahjazz Yeah let’s bring up last game and how he got dogged the whole game. You’re going against a rebuilding team who’s missing 2/3 of their factors. Prove to me that you won’t ever get embarrassed like the Pelicans game and then I’ll consider calling y’all contenders@RealSkipBayless True 💯 even 1998 Utah Jazz older than 2022 Lakers.Bojan has 8 made three pointers now. This is the fourth time in his career he's made 8 in a game and it ties the #UtahJazz team record.
