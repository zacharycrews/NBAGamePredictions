Road Battle at FTX Arena. https://t.co/v8yuGygKy4@jamalsheikh__ @nyknicks They're pretty easy. The key is to start out by pushing the words with the most vowels first and keep trying until you figure out the word.@midrangehoops @hhpthebook @nyknicks Speaking of ABA/old school. My dad played for Spingarn in DC said that “fatty” /“ducky”(vaugh)  ran “out” to “md” to pg to make teams because “inter-high” was so talented they couldn’t make it.@midrangehoops @hhpthebook @nyknicks I seen from 76-77 Archibald was there so… sheesh.Magic Johnson was traded by the Lakers to New York Knicks. 

True or False•The New York Knicks are 3-15 OU following a loss vs a conference opponent 

•CHA Hornets are 0-9 SU in the 2nd game of a B2B

•MIL Bucks are 8-0 to the OVER vs a conference opponent, when coming off an ATS loss (SAC)

Quick little guide for the night owls. We have more 📊@Gtown53001 @hhpthebook @nyknicks Yeah and if memory serves me right, the Nets also got Tiny Archibald right around that time. Can you imagine two local products like that?@nyknicks Cam Reddish has the potential to be a STAR for us. But we’re gonna sit here and watch Thibs treat him like a 10 day contract player, aren’t we?@nyknicks https://t.co/BbIZK4IIch are u kidding me?   Omg.. How are we going to get rid of him if other teams know this?? Management needs to step in.RJ Barrett Is A Superstar In The Makings For The New York Knicks https://t.co/oBoCE5d0HB@midrangehoops @hhpthebook @nyknicks Wow. Can you imagine Julius getting his just do as a hoper from the media local/mainstream then him visibly passing the torch to KD or etc.@hhpthebook @Gtown53001 @nyknicks I still believe Dolan is wielding influence. Probably the real reason why the young guys struggle to get minutes, and we have a coach who isn't fond of giving too many minutes to young players. The Walker signing probably came after a "get me a name" rant.@midrangehoops @Gtown53001 @nyknicks Yes sir. I believe all of that was Dolan still trying pove to NY, that he could do it without Riley. My feeling is he just gave up and gave it to Leon.@hhpthebook @Gtown53001 @nyknicks That's very true. Prior to that the Knicks were handing out first-round picks like flyers.New York Knicks: New York Knicks:  vs Miami Heat: Live Stream, Score Updates and How to Watch NBA Match https://t.co/A9cDZwslI2@Gtown53001 @hhpthebook @nyknicks They tend to chase guys (unsuccessfully) in their primes, but get them when past their primes or post-major injury. Penny Hardaway,  Francis,  Kidd, Rasheed, McDyess, Rose, Kemba, Amar'e, etc. Even hired Phil Jackson for a job he'd never done before and wasn't interested in.@Gtown53001 @midrangehoops @nyknicks There is one thing that came out of the Phil Jackson Era. We starting keeping our picks. Even tho' it was the French prince and Porzingis. But that moment of clarity has held up.@midrangehoops @hhpthebook @nyknicks What about Steph? And my DC guy Steve? Are they part of that terrible signing club ( chasing big names)?@hhpthebook @midrangehoops @nyknicks I’ve spent significant amount of time in that city and the one thing I know I can say is I’ve overlooked the ousting of P.Riley. That is possibly a move that set the franchise back a couple decades. His work in MIA being an ex. ? For my NY bruhs is BK a real threat to Knicks?@hhpthebook @Gtown53001 @nyknicks That Ewing trade set them back for over a decade. It's not even the fact that they traded him, but they ended up taking on some cap-killing contracts in addition. Chasing names have prevented the Knicks from committing to a true rebuild.@Gtown53001 @midrangehoops @nyknicks mistakes.
1. Not keeping Riley,  2. Trading Ewing 3.  Not respecting VanGundy

Dolan, thought of  Riley as a big name. He thought all this team needed was a big name, he went big name hunting   from Zeke to Melo. This is our first rebuild in decades.@CardBoba Penny Hardaway was coaching Memphis East High School

Lol seriously 90% of the @nba looking for that 10g win streak. @nyknicks included@BullsGotNext Nets don’t have fans lol kd and kyrie should’ve went to the Knicks but they don’t want that media attention they ain’t built for that spot light of New York@Josh_Rodriguez_ @JHarden13 @nyknicks LA with LeBron and AD?@nyknicks I think Knox has potential but Cam has even more potential. I am happy with the trade but was frustrated knowing that we have a coach that may not even play him. SMH. Knox has played more than Reddish since the trade. Thibs' allocation of minutes is mind boggling!!!What's #Best today on https://t.co/DVTf2jd2ZR ?

Mets Jets Giants and Knicks so trash. The fans of these teams should sue@BullsGotNext Knicks are the best team in New York@nyknicks Trade Burks!!LeBron always said New York is his playground. Unfortunate he got suspended for the Knicks game at MSG.@Johnny_Kilroy1 @LeBronfactcheck So the NBA could rig it for Cleveland but doesn't give a damn about rigging it for New York City? The best thing for the NBA is the Lakers winning. The next best is the Knicks winning. They've been irrelevant all century. NBA conspiracy nowhere to be seen to help them.After only 15-days I will be getting this Carlson /5 back from PSA along with two other monsters. Hard to avoid looking, since it is only a click or two away. Wish me luck.

Not saying I agree or not, but want to illustrate his angle.Back in Fort Worth to see Texas @ TCU, along with 4 NBA teams- the Detroit Pistons, Milwaukee Bucks, Utah Jazz, and New York Knicks. Should be a packed house, and a big game for many of the fringe top 100 prospects playing tonight to shine. 8 PM on ESPNU@eepdllc @YankeesKnicks99 @rahmmagick @BadBadLeroyBro7 @Knickanators @LukeHen73716015 @KnicksBig15 @LegionOfKnicks @Rick__War @AngelBeingAngel @0oty_Mac @Knickloyalty @StateNYKPOD @victorlb03 @ShannonTFortune @AJTheManChild @Woodshed_1914 @eski225 @IanChisolm @DonaldP47082631 @queens_dude @Markjoh91017488 @MikeFromQns7 @DababyfannNYK @SellDaTeamDolan @Chuck1one @Freekeith @Trace_AVP @Knickstape2005 @_knicks1688 @stalling_e @J1gg__ @JeDiGoLLuM01 @EdMemphisPimpin @mikenieve @acedghill @M4tch3sMa70ne @fthevenin_a @tbarbeeESQ @the_process101 @TMal761 @Jaelin_Taylor @ArchangelReuel @_IamTrueHate @KembasHome @MsMJsays @Sharonchik266 @TruePG718 @boxand21 @nyknicks He would have one if Thibs was the GM of this team like he was of the TWolves. 

Also every team in the NBA makes that Lavine/Butler trade at the time it happened.

Damn.
Basketball.
Game.Since we are a playoff team all i want to see out of my @nyknicks is consistant basketball.@JakePryor77 @NBA_NewYork @MavsFilmRoom @JakeLFischer @thehalftimeapp Sadly, the knicks are the team with leverage in this situation. If Brunson wasnt going to be a FA then this would probably be the package but the best Dallas could get is: Toppin, Noel or Burks, and whatever pick Newyork offersGreat job with both City uniforms @nyknicks @obitoppin1 https://t.co/uxuQLjwofk@JakePryor77 @NBA_NewYork @MavsFilmRoom @JakeLFischer @thehalftimeapp 1 of them is more of a possibility in my eyes. I wish we could off load kemba and Evan but that prob won’t happen. Knicks prob just wait until FA if deal isn’t favorableThanks Sal.  Much appreciated.  Enjoyable days when @NYRangers and @nyknicks were always in the playoffs.

There was nothing worse than dealing with New York media scene intersect with Knicks superiority complex.@NBA_NewYork @JakeLFischer He is most needed.
