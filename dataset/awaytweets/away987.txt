Wilson suffered a non-contact injury with the Toronto Raptors last week. He was re-acquired by the Blue on Monday.

Have to feel for Wilson. He averaged 18.5 points and 10.4 rebounds in 25 games w/ OKC.NBA Picks Wednesday

Toronto Raptors,  Vancouver Grizzlies &amp; Orlando Magic was added with Jordan winning. Bill Russell isn't better than Jordan. STOP IGNORANT HATE PLZ!The Toronto Raptors have had three meaningful winning streaks this season, and a common thread runs through all of them. @michaelgrange tells us what it is and what needs to change for the team to succeed.
