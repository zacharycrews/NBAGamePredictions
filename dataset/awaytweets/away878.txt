MIA are 5-1 in L6 and have a healthy roster here. They rank 4th in DEF RTG over there L10 games and are 14-6 ATS after a loss. CHA are 2-8 in L10 and are 28th in OFF RTG over L10. I expect MIA to make it tough for CHA and win by 6+.

They signed him then sent him to the g league. Don't ask why. No clue@JuiceboxCA I’m a Suns fan and they’ve done some good work, but the Nets and Heat are my favs. Nets always keep it New York. Clean. Urban. The Heat embrace that Miami Vice/summer colors scheme and it always feels like South Beach. 

Worst: Dallas Mavericks@MiamiHEAT @betwayusa We blow double digit leads and lose in the 4th quarter. We need Dragic back. Much better in the 4th quarter than Vincent and even Lowry.

1- Possession
2- Pace
3- Points per game.
Then I asking myself why Miami es better team?. That made me to create a new formula:
EFPP=Points scored/Fiel goal attempts. And here Miami is much better.Consensus Line Move:

https://t.co/QZK5qF2SRH@TheNBACentral Wait what?! Not healthy?? The Miami Heat are number 1 and aren’t healthy!!!@WillManso Great day for a Miami diehard. Wish Heat played and beat the hell outta somebody. But we shall wait. lol@VaschettoSofia @Ticketmaster @TMFanSupport Debating giving up. Was going to surprise my brother to a @MiamiHEAT game on our way to Vegas for his bachelor. No number to call to buy tix and I'm certainly not trying a third time even IF its for different seats. 

Blockchain solves this.@statmuse I wish this DeMar played like this against LeBron Miami Heat team lol 
It would have gone 7 🤔@MannFacts My mom took me to see Collateral in theatres when I was 15, and my dad made me watch Heat on cable with him when he found out I was watching Miami Vice reruns. TIL my parents are super cool!@HeatNationCom Yep yes ok @MiamiHEAT@CardPurchaser /10 opulence - 1st place Miami Heat 🔥 https://t.co/zcGfe2Om9xBeing in the 2 seed like some peasants ain’t for me @MiamiHEATThe nets with Ben10 is actually very scary but i like pressure @MiamiHEAT in 5 VS ANYBODY38 wins for Chicago Bulls unbelievable and we go above Miami Heat in the eastern conference table we’re the number 1 seed now #BullsNationwith the Bulls win, Miami heat are down to 2nd in the eastern conference@DrGuru_ Huh ? Who hates these teams ? Nets I kinda understand but clippers ?? LOL 😆 you trolling. I'm a Miami Heat fan but I feel bad for the clippers. If PG and Kwahi were there they would be doing so much better! Injures suck!@MiamiHEAT y’all got room for another fan I’m done being a Knicks fan@cnkworld @akerzys @NotDasto @uhhkenzo @AgentDoal I be like sheesh (sheesh)
Sunset on the beach (beach)
Make me wanna pull up on Miami with the heat (heat)Bulls are going to win their 5th straight and enter the All-Star break guaranteed to either be atop the East alone or tied with the Heat, depending on Miami's outcome tomorrow.The bulls have ReTaken the 1st seed. Just win tomorrow and set everything back to normal going into the all star break @MiamiHEAT95% of nba Twitter was in kindergarten the last time the Celtics won a playoff series against the heat so it doesn’t really matter #Heatin5 #HEATCulture 

(FYI it was 2010 when the Celtics won a playoff series against Miami.) https://t.co/69BfEUEdBY#Knickshate is a great past time… why do they keep putting this trash team on national tv meanwhile the nba actively has a bias against the #MiamiHeat https://t.co/gvj6QhHTwhi can't believe the raptors traded a miami heat practice facility attendant for thad young. masai &amp; bobby have done it again.Thinking about it, It makes sense for Miami to sign Goran. We need experience at the backup PG spot for when the playoffs start.  #miamiheat #HEATCulture #HeatTwitterMy Miami Heat will save Julius Randle from the Niggabockers soon.@embreyNBA He should be a Miami HeatChicago a few minutes away from a win vs Sacramento which will move the Bulls into the one seed and drop Miami to the two seed. 

A win tomorrow would move the Heat back to one@byBrianGoins @MiamiHEAT @Goran_Dragic Yes... 1 year@elliott_jacks @MiamiHEAT Last charlotte game Lamelo hit him when he was in the air and they banged knees. Likely a contusion. He needs rest.@MiamiHEAT Well don't do it.I’m getting braids this trip, my lace ain’t stand a chance w that Miami heat@HoldenCantor HORRIBLE HORRIBLE AT EVERY SINGLE YEARS HORRIBLE HORRIBLE AT EVERY SINGLE YEARS FOR THAT WORD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Any team needs star power to win in the NBA. LeBron is the one guy who singlehandedly wills his teams to the Finals, he’s a separate debate. Kawhi is closest with his run in Toronto to that.@PT_Arsoras @LilMonsterJDR @junior248123 @MiamiHEAT I never said you did. The person I responded to did.Miami Heat from @growwestcannaco

That’s kinda how championship teams work dude lol@MiamiHEAT I love u@houtz All these hires have me feeling a way I’ve never had the chance to experience with this team. But as @MiamiHEAT fan as well, I can tell it’s serenity and beautiful@TonyBonesDenham @LilMonsterJDR @junior248123 @MiamiHEAT Never claimed the Heat own the Mavs*** lmao oops@TonyBonesDenham @LilMonsterJDR @junior248123 @MiamiHEAT Matters”*@TonyBonesDenham @LilMonsterJDR @junior248123 @MiamiHEAT I never claimed they owned the Heat.

I have my AC at 67 degrees and have the window open in the winter time. In the summer, I put it at the lowest setting it can possibly go.

My Miami condo never had a temp setting above 55 for my 3 years there!i want a miami heat jersey but the price lol and besides, i don't watch them as much as i do the Warriors@MiamiHEAT bring back the dragon!!!
@Goran_Dragic this will cement our title run!! https://t.co/xCRvxbyNsII ain’t been to Heat game in Miami in so long I need to have that feeling again soon 🤕@MiamiHEAT Caleb and Jimmy should both play or else we'll lose again.

With these injuries, the AS break would really be beneficial for the team. I'm looking forward to the 1st game after AS where Keef is the only one on the injury report. 👀👀👀@TheNBACentral But enough about the @MiamiHEAT all season longCome home @Goran_Dragic @MiamiHEAT! 🔥🐉🏠 https://t.co/TSVsrln0SL@MiamiHEAT @SFSkyforce I'm glad he recovered 🤲GUESS WHOS PLAYING AT HEAT NIGHT CLUB ON 2/20/22!
