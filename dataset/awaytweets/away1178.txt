Between the injuries and missed calls we‚Äôve had it‚Äôs amazing we are still in the hunt for the playoffs #LetEmKnow #Cavs #Playoffs #NBA@SportsProNick @ranaaissance @cavs @CapitalBlock1 I completely agree and that is the problem, people are comparing sports NFTs to the likes of Crypto Punks etc. We look at NFTs as longterm fan engagement. Because of what has happened in industry previously people just think NFTs and $$ and that should not be the case in sports@TimMangnall @ranaaissance @cavs @CapitalBlock1 It is only early days Tim, you're right.
