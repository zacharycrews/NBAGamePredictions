Run itI don't trust probable anymore so I'm gonna be slightly nervous the Bucks are more shorthanded than expected up until we get the afternoon injury report, although Milwaukee is off until Friday after tonight's game.The ball movement I saw last night by the Chicago #Bulls reminded me of the Milwaukee Bucks with more versatility.

The Eastern Conference should be concerned. Very concerned.Looks like the Pistons will have the first overall pick in the lineup when they take on the Bucks tonight.

Milwaukee could use another 1/8 performance from Cade as he adjusts to the NBA with so many players sitting out still. https://t.co/T9LANM1rBaI previewed the #Pistons match up with the defending champion #Bucks‚Ä¶this could be Detroit‚Äôs best chance to break a 10-game losing streak, dating back to 2018, with Milwaukee.

Both teams are supposed to be good but are in reality they are bad.i have to re-learn every season that no one respects one of the best alternate uniforms in NBA history
