Trae Young was just ruled out and the Hawks are on a back to back. The Raps are rested after their 3OT thriller and I expect them to take advantage of a tired Hawks team without Trae.

I’m not sure why the rules are like that, it’s just what I heard ✊🏻Seeing how Toronto Raptors fans talk about Goran Dragic is sooo crazy to me. I’d kill to have him back in Miami.#NBA,

https://t.co/aoo6FEvbF5Pregame with @ATLHawks Head Coach Nate McMillan. The Hawks face the @Raptors tonight in Atlanta. Coach McMillan spoke on the Raptors saying, “They play hard and they are going to always bring a lot of energy.” #TrueToAtlanta @FortyEightMins https://t.co/fuPdxJiNKnCoach McMillan said Toronto’s length, athleticism and pace will be the toughest part for tonight’s match-up against the Raptors. 

@HawksFanTV2 NBA shots I'm taking -

Boston Celtics vs. Miami Heat - Celts -4 - 1.70 odds

Miami loads of injuries, played 3OT Saturday and Celts been doing ok and will be home.

Toronto Raptors vs. Atlanta Hawks - -1 Toronto - 2.10 odds

Trae Young questionable, locking hoping he is outPersonally, I don’t think we’re going to get a bag of peanuts for @Goran_Dragic  The situation in @Raptors was a bad fit for both so no blame but without playing value is limited. #nbatradedeadline #Raptors #nba@rob_n_yeeezy @VeniceMase @ShannonSharpe Try going to a Dodger game when the Cubs or Yanks come to town. The Toronto Raptors take over Staples the year after they won the chip. It's just a perfect storm of team that travels well being in the playoffs at a new shiny stadium. Also, LA 9er fans.

In my opinion, obviously, he wanted to be closer to home but he also thought it would be hard to repeat if he stayed. He saw that every team was getting loaded lolY’all are really insecure over VC leaving the raptors when half y’all were babies, Chris Bosh barely moved half us growing up let’s be real. You think if Kawhi was traded to Boston he wouldn’t have left either?? I ain’t insecure at all😭 Toronto over everything lmao@CBCMurdoch @CBC @cbcgem @Raptors @yannick_bisson I certainly agree CBC only has a very few things worth watching the main one is Murdoch Mysteries Still Standing and I like Family Feud most other things we could do without always watch CTV news so don't say they waste my tax dollar!!! on Murdoch MysteriesRaptors fanbase is so traumatized they’re asking a rookie if he’ll stay in Toronto????!

My point is
These non calls benefit raptors help  and switch defence.  Nurse would kill to have those non calls.  and if you think the same discretion will be carried into tonight game you should bet on toronto.
https://t.co/JZdxWQ8WW4@IcyGafford @Lazron @DerozanFan10 @Cheechers___23 @jebronsburner @TheNBACentral @TheSteinLine @Raptors Raps NEED a creator off the bench, Dinwiddie would be good for that. Wiz need to clear the roster cause I THINK you guys are gonna rebuild and trade Beal this summer. We take 3 years of Dinwiddie from you and you guys give us a 2nd. It's good for both teams- Dragic didn’t want to come to Toronto, he was unprofessional from the start.

- He played some of the worst perimeter D I’ve ever seen a Raptor play.

- He never gained the respect of his teammates. 

Hopefully we can get a 2nd rounder for him and let Masai work his magic.So all the speculation and hype about Nick Nurse tonight. Will he be coaching the @Raptors or will he be making his debut in Murdoch Mysteries tonight? Maybe @tim_micallef and @jesserubinoff will discuss and talk about it on @timandfriends today.@NBulowski @Raptors @MiamiHEAT Ahhhhhhhh!

Making Sense of Toronto's Goran Dragic Trade Options

By Aaron Rose

#Raptors #WeTheNorth
https://t.co/vz5lb4SKYd@Cheechers___23 @DerozanFan10 @Lazron @jebronsburner @TheNBACentral @TheSteinLine @Raptors Ok yeah those all make sense to me but I think all of those are negative value@IcyGafford @Lazron @Cheechers___23 @jebronsburner @TheNBACentral @TheSteinLine @Raptors In other words, all parties involved should be “satisifed” somehow or else, there won’t be a trade.@IcyGafford @Lazron @DerozanFan10 @jebronsburner @TheNBACentral @TheSteinLine @Raptors It is, because we either get picks or we get a player who helps us. That is positive value for the Raps.@IcyGafford @DerozanFan10 @Lazron @jebronsburner @TheNBACentral @TheSteinLine @Raptors Dragic for Bledsoe and 1-2 seconds. Dragic for Rubio and 1-2 seconds. Dragic for Fournier and a first. Things like that.

Or you add something of value to Dragic to get someone. Example being Dragic and a first for Myles Turner (would require more but this is an example)@Cheechers___23 @Lazron @DerozanFan10 @jebronsburner @TheNBACentral @TheSteinLine @Raptors so either way overall it's not positive value in return@Raptors Good game Boys!! Siakam has been playing like a true ALL Star!@OspreysFB @Raptors @NewEraCap @UniWatch @PhilHecken @HatClub @jay_pea619 @SnottieDrippen @GribbitAndRipIt @chiguy2420 @EVOLbrims @ChrisRodz93 @d_reisenger Are you selling these or just showing your work?@IcyGafford @Lazron @Cheechers___23 @jebronsburner @TheNBACentral @TheSteinLine @Raptors “Bad” is relative to the team who owns it.@IcyGafford @Lazron @DerozanFan10 @jebronsburner @TheNBACentral @TheSteinLine @Raptors Yes, which means that teams would compensate the Raps with picks for taking on long term salary.

Or they're actual players worth that 20m salary, and the Raps throw in a pick to get that player. The team gets salary relief and a pick.@DerozanFan10 @Lazron @Cheechers___23 @jebronsburner @TheNBACentral @TheSteinLine @Raptors and what is one trade that would work where the other team is sending positive value in return@Lazron @DerozanFan10 @Cheechers___23 @jebronsburner @TheNBACentral @TheSteinLine @Raptors and those players they get back would have to be bad contracts@IcyGafford @Lazron @Cheechers___23 @jebronsburner @TheNBACentral @TheSteinLine @Raptors Wrong.  You ttaded some assets back too so in theory, you would still be 100M after the Dragic trade and then you’ll be down to 80M after this season.  You are not just adding 20M to your cap coz its a TRADE.10 best scorers in Toronto Raptors history: 

 https://t.co/1iXKaH7SVp@IcyGafford @DerozanFan10 @Cheechers___23 @jebronsburner @TheNBACentral @TheSteinLine @Raptors ....

They're trading players, not taking on 20 and sending nothing. Jeeeezus@DerozanFan10 @Lazron @Cheechers___23 @jebronsburner @TheNBACentral @TheSteinLine @Raptors yes because your trading for a terrible contract in the first place@Lazron @DerozanFan10 @Cheechers___23 @jebronsburner @TheNBACentral @TheSteinLine @Raptors that doesn't clear up space though for example if you are currently at 100m and then trade for Dragic you go up to 120m once his contract expires it goes back down to 100m@IcyGafford @Lazron @Cheechers___23 @jebronsburner @TheNBACentral @TheSteinLine @Raptors And that’s not a good thing?@IcyGafford @Lazron @Cheechers___23 @jebronsburner @TheNBACentral @TheSteinLine @Raptors A negative value to one team does not necessarily mean it would be same for the other team.Don't forget to join me @BottomLine_TO tonight for the @MapleLeafs vs @NJDevils &amp; @Raptors vs @ATLHawks https://t.co/Lx2EOEbAFS@Lazron @DerozanFan10 @Cheechers___23 @jebronsburner @TheNBACentral @TheSteinLine @Raptors Expiring money isn't a good thing besides the fact it gets you off the terrible contract@Lazron @DerozanFan10 @Cheechers___23 @jebronsburner @TheNBACentral @TheSteinLine @Raptors I would do that but that's because I see Dinwiddie as negative value@IcyGafford @DerozanFan10 @Cheechers___23 @jebronsburner @TheNBACentral @TheSteinLine @Raptors It's. For. The. Expiring. Money.@DerozanFan10 @IcyGafford @Cheechers___23 @jebronsburner @TheNBACentral @TheSteinLine @Raptors I get that he's a Wiz fan, but this is still an odd hill to die on. 

PS - Dinwiddie for Dragic helps you a lot@DerozanFan10 @Cheechers___23 @Lazron @jebronsburner @TheNBACentral @TheSteinLine @Raptors because teams aren't giving up something good for half a year of a backup pg@IcyGafford @Lazron @DerozanFan10 @jebronsburner @TheNBACentral @TheSteinLine @Raptors they might give up a player who has multiple years on his contract for salary relief. If the player sucks, they’d have to add asset to compensate that. If the player is good, then the Raps would add picks.@Lazron @DerozanFan10 @Cheechers___23 @jebronsburner @TheNBACentral @TheSteinLine @Raptors the fact they aren't going to give something good for half a year of a backup pg@IcyGafford @Cheechers___23 @Lazron @jebronsburner @TheNBACentral @TheSteinLine @Raptors Haha!  Man, how can you say that?  You clearly are a newbie in this subject.@IcyGafford @DerozanFan10 @Cheechers___23 @jebronsburner @TheNBACentral @TheSteinLine @Raptors Based on what?@DerozanFan10 @Cheechers___23 @Lazron @jebronsburner @TheNBACentral @TheSteinLine @Raptors Those assets wouldn't be valuable players though@Steeebo @Raptors What's this now? Was he traded? Can't see that anywhere.@CBCMurdoch @CBC @cbcgem @Raptors @yannick_bisson First episode of season 15 started last Thursday &amp; I’m hooked again after 1 episode.

Simple math.@pajarito_carol @James_bacalso @Raptors Loss* + ratio+ your team ain’t getting no where+ 3 lucky 3s@Cheechers___23 @Lazron @DerozanFan10 @jebronsburner @TheNBACentral @TheSteinLine @Raptors But he's paid 20m and nobody has the cap space to afford that@__OGtheClampGod What he wrote is deplorable, people like you should only hide in front a man like Dragić. Be ashamed. @NBA @Raptors@NBulowski @Raptors @MiamiHEAT Ahhh! Congrats Natasha❤️@IcyGafford @Lazron @DerozanFan10 @jebronsburner @TheNBACentral @TheSteinLine @Raptors you implied the Raptors would trade assets (picks) to get out of paying Dragic, when he’s an expiring contract. You very clearly don’t understand how this worksIn 2019-20 the Raptors went 3-0 against Atlanta.
In 2020-21 the Hawks went 3-0 against Toronto.

Listen ➡️ https://t.co/EYmkjkygDK https://t.co/0JsJMz7pLv#StarExclusive: Raptors finding great interest in a Goran Dragic deal before NBA trade deadline, sources say. 

Toronto is almost certain the veteran guard will be dealt in one of a number of scenarios, instead of being bought out. https://t.co/0p4uYBAhdkAll five of the Toronto Raptors' starters played 53+ minutes against the Heat:

Pascal Siakam - 57 mins 
OG Anunoby - 56 mins 
Scottie Barnes - 56 mins
Fred VanVleet - 54 mins
Gary Trent Jr - 56 mins

It's the first time a team has had five players above 50+ minutes since 1955.🤯 https://t.co/1izNvLpl3B#toronto #Raptors are so much fun to watch right now, https://t.co/4j1jP8bo4cThe Hawks have a chance to be a .500 ball club with a win against the Toronto Raptors at home Monday night.

TOR just played a triple-OT game against MIA Saturday. The Hawks have won 7 in a row.

The last time Atlanta was .500 or better was in early-December.

Whats bs is that we have to go to Toronto on Tuesday on a back to back again. You Raptors fans better hope you dont lose that game..@Raptors Amazing game 👏👏👏 .... go go Freddie AllStar  ...Did you believe that? Those pictures are from when the @Raptors won the championship and this was the street party in support of them. When people actually were United. 

There were certainly a lot of people in Ottawa. Thousands but now where near the almost 2mil for the Raps.Thoughts?? @Raptors @OrlandoMagic https://t.co/dVGNyVhyv3@BaliJibril And this was the championship parade for the Toronto Raptors when they won in 2019

Yes yes I know it’s a joke@DoubleDickie @AnitaTimeOut @bennyjohnson @TheoFleury14 Clearly Toronto… during the Raptors victory celebration a few years ago.  Fools.
There were fewer than 10,000 in Ottawa.  
Few were actually truckers. (Rednecks in pickups don’t count).

Poor little Raptor fans.  Rough life@JimKarasBoxing @Raptors man, if no one else, I would love it.

And I can say thy weren't distanced or wearing masks, yet you still won't allow fans at @MapleLeafs or @Raptors games.
