Mr Charles said that the @warriors can't beat the the @Bucks , what you think,  I am watching the game tonight at in the @Tutk 😷🍺@warriors @blackhonee need these kicks@NBA @warriors Am I crazy or does his shot look a little bit different@KingJosiah54 Why should race matter when hiring a head coach? The Golden State Warriors fired Mark Jackson and then went on to become a dynasty under Steve Kerr. Did they win because Kerr is white? No. Would they have become that same dynasty under Jackson? No... Fit matters race doesn’t.@warriors Give klay more time pls for the love of godNBA: Milwaukee Bucks vs Golden State Warriors Live Stream

It’s the laker fans that became warriors fans, because the lakers were terrible in 2017. Due to all of them not wanting to deal with losing. So when the warriors were losing they hated it, and had to have a scape goat@warriors @22wiggins It took a bit, but seems like he’s finally starting to get to where we all hoped he would go@warriors Giannis&gt;&gt;@warriors Draymond Green is the key to the Dubs.

https://t.co/dwBXJcaBb2 https://t.co/zEE8hos4PA@yikes763 @warriors @KlayThompson If you said it was unfair because he’s been out, then I would’ve never said anything. To say it’s rigged is nonsensical because a bunch of people want to see him and are voting for him. I hate the fan voting system in all of these sports but it is what it is.@warriors Locked in...@ov71toskala @StephsRings @TrolledByPG @statmuse @warriors @WarriorsPR And I agree that team success doesn't matter to be an all star. But it does matter to get exposure from the media to get votes. You think Ja would be a starter if his team was a 9 seed with his same stats? Hell no. Everyone's been talking him up because his team is also great.Will the @Sixers move Ben Simmons? How high can Klay Thompson lift the @Warriors?

I already said AD will probably make it. JV isn't even top 10 in votes, he'd need the coaches and players to literally all vote for him to make it. Ayton won't make it if cp3 and booker do, and, again, not top 10.@warriors and @okcthunder and need you guys beat and win tonight’s game for me@warriors Looks like he’s dropping 40 tonight@warriors feels so good to have him back@therealselena23 @warriors nobody is scared of the lakers@BetMGM @Bucks -1 over @warriors

PG is gonna be injured for the all Star game. Porzingis is playing worse than last season when everyone was tearing him apart, there's no chance he makes it.

The Golden State Warriors just lost to the Pelicans.  Does that mean they are a bad team too?  Absolutely not.  Win some, lose some. But this Wolves team is a top 10 Western Conference team.

I do think there could be a better balance between on/off ball than what we saw the last few games but yeah, never gonna be ideal when you miss someone as vital as Dray🚨NBA play🚨 1/13/21 @warriors +1.5.

do think it can be a good thing to shake things up.. just seems like there's this natural assumption that Dray's out so that means no motion.. without considering that Dray is key to the PnR etc too..@warriors Is Draymond back?@D_Huncho1 @warriors Slowly getting there...At least in points, in efficiency yea he’s still in a “slump”@warriors Plz just win at least this game ..@warriors gluck!@GSWRevengeTour @warriors I think that’ll happen next week...Or ar least I hope so@warriors Great..another brick show.I don't wanna see a single post of them shooting 3s in warm up@warriors Please win this game and tomorrow's game against bulls. We need to get back in winning column. Tell curry to pick his shot, pool not to force tough 3 pointers, lee to shoot wide open 3's, and kerr's rotation.
