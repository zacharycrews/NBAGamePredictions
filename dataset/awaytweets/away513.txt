He just hasn't been consistent because he has not found the right proper home yet and his opportunity wasn't enough. So he just needs a right chance and to be consistent. I'm just praying that he plays great here.@dallasmavs @isaiahthomas All money on Thomas!! Mavs win!! https://t.co/uSN4QDdXKlThe Bulls finished the night with a season-high 38 assists.
