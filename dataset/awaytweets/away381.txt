It's really incredible how awful that franchise is.Are you ready to see the @SacramentoKings take on the @memgrizz at @Golden1Center? Listen LIVE in 10 minutes for your shot to WIN a pair of tickets to the game! 🏀 https://t.co/r8pEegc3rXIf the NBA lets the 21-4 @warriors pick up @Dsabonis11 it just shows how Tremendously STUPID this league is 🙄 For Jesus Christ, PUT HIM ON A TEAM THAT F****** NEEDS HIM! @hornets @WashWizards @SacramentoKings @okcthunder? Just makes the Warriors looks like pussies 👍The Sacramento Kings only have one more loss than the Lakers and Nuggets, and two more losses than the Mavericks and Clippers. Let that sink in.@SacramentoKings @swipathefox What their record? Doesn't matter then.Hey @SacramentoKings,

Think surrounding Fox with a power forward that averages 19 points, 8.5 rebounds, and 3.5 assists a night would be smart. You could probably get him for Buddy Hield and a couple first round picks. Just a thought.@MattGeorgeSAC @Spotify Best Sacramento Kings Podcast 💯💯💯To my #1 podcast of 2021, Locked On Kings - Daily Podcast On The Sacramento Kings: thank you for keeping me company on @Spotify all year long! #SpotifyWrapped https://t.co/Gbxboy75Bf @MattGeorgeSACThe Sacramento Kings haven't been to the NBA Playoffs since 2006.

De'Aaron Fox scored 33 points, Tyrese Haliburton logged another double-double and the Kings picked up their third-straight win on Wednesday night.

Next up: a three-game road-trip beginning tomorrow in Charlotte. https://t.co/GsZfNqeRIo@SacramentoKings @swipathefox Is this a flex?

Like the heavy handedness here. 😁@SacramentoKings @TyHaliburton22 @alexlen @Chimezie_Metu @hoopculture13 @buddyhield Kings have a 15 year playoff drought tied for longest in NBA history. Last winning season record was '05/'06. Instead of focusing on acts for their half time show, they need to gutter the house. With such a bad record every year,u would think their draft picks would have helped.Houston Rockets 114-104 Brooklyn Nets 
Grizzlies 96-104 Dallas Mavericks
Minnesota Timberwolves 104-136 Utah Jazz
