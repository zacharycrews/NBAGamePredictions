Toronto Racoons, Toronto Towers, Toronto Traffic, would all be better suited than “Grizzlies”.

I like the idea of a Global Twine &amp; Wine!🍷Boston Celtics vs. Toronto Raptors: Stream, lineups, injury reports and broadcast info (10/22) https://t.co/YW1oFRF5SgI also think Vince Carter’s fine ass should have been on the Top 75 list. What was the Toronto Raptors’ without Vince?@teamFERRAND @Raptors The players are there to be sexualized. Everything’s tight fit on them.@Raptors @TangerineHoops That’s the Ghanaian spirit right there 🤩 🇬🇭We teamed up with @TangerineHoops  to honour Nana Dankwah, a hero who has continuously supported his community during the pandemic. He has kept the Raptors’ spirit alive and made a positive impact in the Jane-Finch neighbourhood.

We don’t have an NFL team, so you can pretty much choose whichever team you want I guess.  Odd that his helmet looks like the Eagles though! 😂@Raptors These guys know what's up https://t.co/ViEDg2z4nE@timandfriends Yup #TheDragon 🐉 @Goran_Dragic  tell it like it is... Veteran experience.. @Raptors #WeTheNorth chip planning@Raptors @DALANOBANTON Someone on Reddit called him D Rex which is about perfect. 🦖@imrubberuglue @Billius27 @Raptors @ScotiabankArena This is similar to what we have seen at Leafs games. Only a very small minority are wearing masks.@Taciiaa_ @Raptors smh.... let me steal something@HumberlyG @Raptors And the 🥨Toronto Raptors https://t.co/zltzsjWaae@blessedmom07 Noooooooooooooo!!!

Can they be replaced?@Raptors @DALANOBANTON Dalano lifted the game. The whole game changed when he stepped on the court. Excited to see how Dalano develops 🙏I've seen enough. @raptors are making the Eastern Conference Finals.

#WeTheNorth@Wainright24 @Suns Congratulations! We'll be cheering for you...until you play the @Raptors and then.....well...you know. 🤣♥️🏀🇨🇦

#WeTheNorthThanks to @Bucks, the @Raptors players and fans are now fully recovered. Solidarity under the rim.It’s time to admit that Kyle Lowry is a stellar defender now that he’s not on the Toronto Raptors@Sportsnet @Raptors @ArashMadani Ffs fix your god damn app!!!! It buffers every five seconds, unacceptable@william_lou 5 points so far and I thought @Raptors offence was bad yesterday ahaha@Bucks only have 5 points and the quarter is almost over!! Now I don’t feel so bad about the @Raptors@dakinsdesign @adamcooperF1 @Raptors Nah, if they're doing different teams they'll save the Warriors for Latifi, who's from Toronto.

Stroll backs the Giants in football, for what it's worth.@Roberty_Boberty @alysontheother @Raptors If you're going to melt down, do it at the Raptors game. The atmosphere is so lit, you'd fit right in 😀@BobHaggith @NBAonTNT I loved Vince!!! He put the @Raptors on the map!!!@blessedmom07 All the best to @Klow7 . We miss him as a @Raptors but wish him all the best and thank him for all the amazing memories he gave us.@BruceDwayne @Raptors Lol about a months worth 😅@JustEsBaraheni I wish we lived in a world where Kyle returned to the Raptors on a 1 year contract. Not only did he deserve a proper farewell in TORONTO, but he would have really elevated this years team.@elrj26 @Raptors Yes they do because men have been producing music videos and films where they have been sexualising women for years. So it has become « normalized ». Hence my request to normalize seeing naked men.🗣 “It’s hard to not be a fan……if you’re not pinching yourself, I don’t think you’re being realistic.”

What an amazing moment for him as he really sparked things in that 4th Q. He's going to earn many more minutes as the season goes along. He's really impressed me thus far.@AParent2021 @Raptors @Klow7 No you didn’t … I will always a part of you guys 💕Tough Lose @Raptors . We have to settle down, and not rush some shots. Lot of time on the shot clock. Lets play better Friday. @NBATV Love it. @dizzy https://t.co/9Rjgrs63z3@Raptors I think you should start with Fred, OG, Scottie, Boucher and Birch…. With Delano, Precious, Gary and Goran off the bench!

One time Raymond Cho stopped his car and spoke to my brother and I. Super random but it felt kinda cool. Haven’t forgotten that moment. Just wish he wasn’t pro-Cons@Wainright24 @Suns That’s fantastic! I love the @Raptors AND the @Suns https://t.co/sLTqQaRDZw'Q' FROM THE CBC AT 8PM FOR THURS. 10-21
