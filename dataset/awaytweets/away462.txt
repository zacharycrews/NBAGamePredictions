I project Collins at just over 23 pts with the volume he should see. In both of the 2021 previous matchups he’s scored over 201u John Collins o20.5 pts (-104) FD

Collins will have to take over tonight on a depleted Orlando Magic team. He has the green light as Trae Young, Clint Capela, Deandre Hunter, and Danilo Gallanari are all out.
