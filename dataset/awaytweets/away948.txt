 #NBAPicks #bettingtips https://t.co/D5ODqiHYQkMy pick of the day for today is Minnesota Timberwolves TTo120 (-120). Thunder are down dort, JRE, Giddey, Favors, Aaron Wiggins (who I think plays) and the timberwolves are a team that usually scores a lot anyways. Gonna be big games out of DLO and KAT without AE https://t.co/sLbW55NmlhThe Thunder returns to OKC to kick off a three-game homestand beginning on a City Night where the team matches up against a rare division foe in the Minnesota Timberwolves.
