I am VERY excited for starling marte in NY. Very good baseball player who by the sounds of it everyone in Miami wanted to extend last seasonThe Miami Heat can't beat the Minnesota Timberwolves; they just can't. You can't win games with poor, lazy defense, too many turnovers, and another fourth collapse on the offensive end.

There's no way "Golden Girls" is set in Miami. They wear altogether too many layers for Florida heat.@dirtyyybird @Lakers @MiamiHEAT Stop it bird lol this is the lakers ‘ 7th loss after leading by 10+ this season ties the nba record.. Them boys just can’t play defense and choke at the end of games@MrHonkdizzle @Lakers @MiamiHEAT Honestly, we have seen this pattern with Lebron for a while… he is basically the coach and GM of the team…@AO2501 @MiamiHEAT @JimmyButler @Bam1of1 @raf_tyler @Kia yep. so far he's the only one consistently living up to the agendaOne of the most undervalued teams and players...Precious Achiuwa for the Toronto Raptors (this was last years print for the heat), what a sick card from Panini Black, RPA /15.

That’s not the dna for a so-called championship team? 🤔 @MiamiHEAT@RealSkipBayless Lakers need Miami Heat version Lebron.

Jump shooter Bron not gon do it for them. https://t.co/CLkCclnX63Let’s be honest if the pandemic didn’t stop the nba season in 2020 , lakers would not have that chip , and even if they made the championship they wouldn’t have played the Miami heat@dennisstoly You do know Miami is in another time zone? I'm not even done with work to watch most heat games unless they're travelling... I understand you're dissapointed but I'm not the reason the Lakers lost to the kings.....

Hardly, I recall the Thibs Bulls sweeping the Miami Heat with Big 3 in regular season got their butts kicked in the playoffs by the heat Thibs was a good coach when Drose in his prime. Donovan is better See what happens in the playoffs unless the Knicks don’t make it.Win tomorrow @MiamiHEAT@Jaylen31055914 @nba_paint @JimmyButler @MiamiHEAT @NBA Get a job dude@quammmmy #theeyesareblindtowhatthemindcannotsee you gotta start owning these other @NBA teams/players. #Dominance @MiamiHEATNo way niggas made a Miami Heat space.

#BullsNation https://t.co/TU7NSNU2cQ@CourtneyFallon_ @MiamiHEAT There is one.This is the time of year where I REALLY struggle keeping up with pro wrestling content. 

Specifically WWE. 

NFL and college football is in full gear. 

I watch either the Miami Heat or NBA League Pass every night like it’s going out of style cause I’m not wasting $30 a month.#DuncanRobinson Is Key To MiamiHeat Being ‘Favorites’ or ‘Flops’

KFNKDJSJA me la aprendi de tanto ver ese video https://t.co/6Pv6EHgkiR@MiamiHEAT @JimmyButler @Bam1of1 @raf_tyler @Kia Gotta love the heat coreI will never understand the NBA schedule makers. So the Bulls play a back to back against the Magic and Heat but one is in Orlando and the other in Chicago. Why not just have them take the hour flight from Orlando to Miami?@TheJaxShow @ruthriley00 @WillManso @BallyHEAT @MiamiHEAT @Audacy @Mister_Pierce How are you doing today@Graham_Couch When it’s 32 F and snowing, talent differences start to narrow while toughness differences start to widen. It is the opposite physical challenge of the heat in Miami. The game tomorrow may very well be decided by 2nd half turnovers in a cold and sparsely attended Spartan Stadium.Really thought we would be facing the Heat with a 14-6 record but whatever. Can’t get over that loss to HOU, but i will if we win against Miami. https://t.co/b704QUexJU@chicagobulls @DeMar_DeRozan @NikolaVucevic @ZachLaVine Crush @MiamiHEAT tomorrow. #BullsNation@MiamiHEAT @JimmyButler is the inspiration behind my 2kleague  player I was wondering could ur organization or @JimmyButler like and retweet my let me in the combine tweetTomorrow's gonna be a tough game cause it's against Miami Heat😤😤FINAL: Bulls beat Magic, 123-88

We couldn't be prouder of our guy!

Sound On // @JBLaudio https://t.co/u7FkhUXGALMiami Heat- Can Oladipo return to form, can Lowry show more aggressiveness in scoring, is their depth good enough?

Utah Jazz- Can somebody be a reliable 2nd option on offense, can Rudy punish smaller lineups on offense, is their perimeter defense gonna hold up?@Wadesburner @RealGokTurk @MiamiHEAT @JimmyButler @Bam1of1 @raf_tyler @Kia Rare wade burner L#MIAvsCHI

Who will win?
