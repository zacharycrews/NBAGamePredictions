In a different situation, he could score 22ppg, but this team spreads it around. He is more likely to make All-Defense than All-Star, but Olynyk isn’t even close to as good as Mikal.The Dallas Mavericks (26-19) will welcome the Phoenix Suns (34-9) to American Airlines tonight.

There's a lot of star power in the backcourt of this matchup with CP3, Devin Booker, and Luka Doncic. Phoenix has won 7 of 8. Dallas is riding a 4-game winning streak https://t.co/lSM9jxLUYZ@DevinBook and the @Suns play today. So today is a good day! 🧡💜Day 20 of 2022 of voting for #DevinBooker to play in the #NBAAllStar game! Last double voting day @Suns fans!The Phoenix Suns have played 43 games so far this season. 33% of their losses occurred in their first 4 games. Since then they’re 33-6, i.e., winning at an 85% clip, often without at least one key contributor.

Without Murray and Joker the nuggets are bottom 5 in the league. Jokic does EVERYTHING for them. Giannis and others carry their teams but Jokic IS the team now. He also took out Marcus Morris who, although I'm a Heat fan, deserved what he got. Joker = MVP. https://t.co/2r1XLkmfbP@Suns @socios Since 1988. Kevin Johnson.Only 1 NBA pick so far: Mavs +3. I'm also leaning under, but total is rising, so no pick on that yet.

Suns are without Ayton and Mavs are 2-0 ATS vs Phoenix this year. Both were in Phoenix w/out Luka.

0.75U. Even down Ayton, the Mavs don’t have the Bigs to make a lot of noise down low. Dallas is hot but on a B2B off a W vs. a better Phoenix Team on 2 Days Rest. Given the Suns ability to disrupt Luka, they should come out on top tonight.

#NBATopShotThis@HollywoodHrndz @betting_joes @FDSportsbook Suns may cover, but don't base the decision off B2B. Mavs are 4-3 this year ATS on 2nd night of B2B. Mavs are also 2-0 ATS vs the Suns this year and both of those games were in Phoenix and the Mavs didn't have Luka. Suns don't have Ayton tonight.Phoenix Suns vs. Dallas Mavericks picks, predictions, odds: Who wins NBA game Thursday? https://t.co/uIMpaZXV0t@Christi58966336 @TrulyNolen @Suns GO SUNS!Devin Booker and the Western Conference-leading Suns are in Dallas.

Throw in a Savy vet superstar and now your the Phoenix Suns before the Phoenix Suns with the young core.@TrulyNolen @Suns Go Suns@Suns @socios Watching book highlights in 2016 made me a suns fanThe Phoenix Suns (11.2) and Dallas Mavericks (11.1) have the NBA's top net ratings over the last 10 games. 

During this stretch, the Mavericks have the top defensive rating (98.2) while the Suns have led in offensive rating (117.2). 

This will be a fascinating matchup.【Stock information】CHAMPION "PHOENIX SUNS 34 BARKLEY" BASKET TANK / PURPLE / https://t.co/KYm8hdjO0GThe Dallas Mavericks and Phoenix Suns are tied for the longest-active winning streak (4 games) in the NBA. 

The Mavericks have the league's best record (9-1) over the last 10 games while the Suns are not far behind at 8-2 during that stretch.

Both teams play Thursday on TNT.I really only do live bets now, besides long parlays.  But here’s my card for 1/20/22.

Steve Nash@TrulyNolen @Suns Look - yes signed shoes are a thing, but the phrase “autographed Frank Kaminsky shoe” is just about the best thing I’ve seen in print in a solid three+ years.  I want it to be known that I’m in this for Frank’s signed shoe. Right or left? 

-IT DOES NOT MATTER-

Go Suns!@Suns @socios Walter “Sweet D” Davis But Kyle Macy with his preppy haircut and his cute little crew socks kept me coming back for more! 🥰@MichelobULTRA Phoenix Suns 🌞@Suns @socios Steve Nash@Suns @socios Chris Pauli should move to phoenix these niggas my suns@Suns @socios Barkley coming to town in 1992 and everyone talking about it.

Collapse one on top of the other to make the black sun - AKA, solar eclipse.  The one tower that now stands was supposed to be called 'WTC Phoenix,' but that was too obvious.  

Also, the towers were built in '68.  They stood for 33 years. 👁️@TrulyNolen @Suns Go Suns 🌞@Suns @socios Walter Davis &amp; Kyle Macy@Suns @socios Devin booker@TrulyNolen @Suns Go Suns!@Suns @socios Kevin Johnson,from Japan.@money_talks65 @LakerCentral365 They could have done multiple smaller trades to address the 2 REAL WEAKNESSES = ability to make WIDE OPEN 3-POINTERS against Phoenix Suns 4 defenders clogging the paint.

Booker rekindled my love for the Suns.@Suns @socios @SteveNash mainly, @SHAQ@Suns @socios I've been watching the Suns since I was a baby in '99 with my dad@Suns @socios THE GOAT @SteveNash@Suns @socios Being enamored with Nash’s play style. But, looking back on it, it’s one of my favorite moments of my life. Sad to say, it’s the only Suns game I’ve ever been to.@MichelobULTRA Phoenix suns@TrulyNolen @Suns Go Suns!!!@Suns @socios I’m gonna sound so young, but Steve Nash. My parents and I went to a Suns game in 2012 against the Timberwolves. Nash had 13-17-8. I didn’t know much about basketball, if anything, I was thrown off that the score was so high, 104-95. I was big into football. But I remember…@TrulyNolen @Suns Go suns!@Suns I would inquire on Danilo Gallinari.@Suns @socios Steve Nast.@angelinams112 @Suns @socios Is that code for the free beer he got fans for not showing up to an event 😳@AytonDom @Suns @jj_redick @ESPNNBA @espn That is your opinion.@Suns @socios I was born in '84 so, been a fan since birth.@Suns @socios Paul Westphal@itdooonotmatta @deetrippy12 Winning an NBA Championship and having the best defensive rating at the end of the regular season mean “little to nothing”?

Full stop. Drink some water.

Lakers were about to go up 3-1 against the Suns, then AD got hurt. Phoenix didn’t run the Lakers off the court, injuries did.Phoenix Suns, not Golden State Warriors, should be West favorite, ESPN's JJ Redick says https://t.co/tpUO9jPzth@TrulyNolen @Suns Go Suns@Suns @socios Landry Shamet@ktsoowavy @DevinBook @Suns Way cool@MichelobULTRA @Suns The lack of respect for Suns from you just validates my preference to drinking @805Beer instead.@TrulyNolen @Suns Go suns!!!!!!!@MichelobULTRA Phoenix Suns for the win!@TrulyNolen @Suns Go Suns@MichelobULTRA That’s cool. Leave off the @Suns from your lineup. At least in this marketing pic. We have other STUFF that makes us the #1 team in the @NBA. Keep hating!!!! https://t.co/TBj2jPONOU@Suns @socios My guy Chris Paul 🧡💜@CooolJay_ How old am I? I'm so old, I remember the Bucks, game 2 against the Phoenix Suns, 1978.
The old Milwaukee Arena, seating 12,000 fans, going nuts, delayed the start of the game for 4 minutes after a TV time out, I believe in the fourth quarter.
No bad seat in the place.@ktsoowavy @DevinBook @Suns Skills@NBA @JaValeMcGee @Suns One of the most underrated centers in the league@MichelobULTRA Phoenix Suns@Suns @socios since 1993, because sir Charles! 💜🧡🏀 https://t.co/sLIui8Tnon@Espo @MichelobULTRA Aren't they a @suns sponsor???@TrulyNolen @Suns Go Suns@Suns @socios KJ is my all-time favorite player since I moved here in 1990@TrulyNolen @Suns go suns!!! :)))@Suns @socios Westy and The Oklahoma Kid in 1975-76@TrulyNolen @Suns Go Suns@Suns @socios @SteveNash is the guy who made me a Suns fan and is my sports heroThey clearly didn’t design a can for the @suns.
