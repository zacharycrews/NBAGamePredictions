San Antonio's extraordinary 22-year playoff streak ended because they haven't drafted an All-Star in a decade. #NBA https://t.co/XCKZVEWrY3@BigChrizzle Yeah I mean that’s a close one to me but I wouldn’t be mad either way. Timmy is underrated by a lot of folks but then again there’s a lot out there that respect his game. I’m a little bias bc I’m a spurs fan since Admiral was ballin.

But instead you rather he take Bryn's 8.5 minutes as a roleplayer instead of 30+ in Austin developing his game further in a lead ball handler role. A role he wouldn't get in San Antonio to start@Lore_spurs @TheFadeawayPod @thehalestone Also, Manu Ginobili didn't play for San Antonio until four seasons after he was drafted as he was playing in Italy still. Which you could even consider as him developing further in another league.

Even our most beloved player had spent time elsewhere to develop🤠 Otro duelo Tejano

He played 54 games in his career for the Spurs.@thebradbecker San Antonio doesn't have those minutes to give out nor that role compared to the rest of the roster. And this team is still in the mindset to win games and doing that isn't going to make them competitive like they have been so far. Spurs know how to develop their players@LakersReporter Same 1st Unit Center, DeAndre Jordan as in the San Antonio Spurs game the night before and against head coach Greg Popovich. 😌😌😌 Why less interior scoring against a group of very young OKC Thunder players programmed to lose games?San Antonio is 15-6-1 ATS in its last 22 road games.  The Spurs are 18-8-1 ATS in their last 27 games as road underdogs.  Dallas is 0-5 ATS in its last five home games.  The Mavericks are 11-22 ATS in their last 33 games vs. a team with a losing record.  Bet the Spurs Thursday.Thursday's Free Pick: San Antonio Spurs +7

The San Antonio Spurs opened their season with a 123-97 win over the Orlando Magic.  They have gone 0-3 since with three competitive losses to three of the best teams in the NBA in the Nuggets by 6, the Bucks by 10 and the Lakers by 4.@GuruLakers @_MarcusGuy Shortly after the disaster that was GM/Coach ML Carr in Boston, the GM of the San Antonio Spurs hired himself as coach. “Who is this 🤡 Gregg Popovich &amp; who does he think he is hiring himself as coach” pretty much sums up my sentiments at the time.

Spurs drafted for best available, so if their best available player was a 4, I’d bet money he’d be in San Antonio right now. One of the major reasons Primo is now in Austin is because he’s a guard, and there’s just so little room for another atmSpurs vs Lakers game at San Antonio 😩 it was stressful, never in my life have I ever felt so many different things in not even an hour #LakersWin #SanAntonio https://t.co/rF6NdJgZ2v@Sinfulskin2 Spurs vs Celtics in San Antonio 1979-80The Lakers that has two "MVP-candidate level players" in Russ and AD barely beat the 'who the fuck is still there' San Antonio Spurs and lost to the 'literally kids' OKC Thunder.
