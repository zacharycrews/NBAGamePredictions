Unique and has a very good chance for mass adoption. They will have fiat on ramp so it opens it up to everyone not in crypto. If the game is good which is pretty much guarenteed this will only go one way 👍👍👍🚀🚀@Mavs_FFL @TexasLegends And the best shooter on the Dallas Mavericks !!New listing!

They should have resigned him. SMDH.@dallasmavs @BallySportsSW weather forecast: raining buckets@dallasmavs Hopefully not we need to trade half of them@dallasmavs @BallySportsSW No Luka no hope@OfficialNBARefs @BrooklynNets @dallasmavs @NBAonTNT You all are less than garbage 🗑@dallasmavs @BallySportsSW The Mavs look like a lifeless, unsure of itself, no confidence, just having fun, waiting for the OTHER player to make a play team! Watch other relevant NBA games around the league. The MAVS can't sniff anyone of their JOCKS. Moses Brown J Kidd!Josh Richardson for Seth Curry… Like Breh. Wtf was y’all doing @dallasmavsOutside of 2018 our scouting department have been shambles I don’t understand why the mavs are so hesitant to trade their picks, never do much with them anyways @mcuban @dallasmavs GET LUKA HELP. If only mark was as good at creating a great team as he is when it comes to business@clegainz @nbatopshot @ShotTalkin Dallas Mavericks
TS: robert1an15th overall selection for the ’22 NBA Draft as we sit in December belongs to the Dallas Mavericks. I’d love to see Kentucky G TyTy Washington w/ DAL. Washington could run the 2nd team as a 6th man or step in and be the starting 2 right away w/ Luka at the point #NBA @dallasmavsDallas Mavericks star Luka Doncic has been ruled out of Sunday’s game at Oklahoma City because of left ankle soreness. https://t.co/GiFZp777wZ@Original_Turner Come to @dallasmavs@dallasmavs @mcuban hi there, my brother in law just lost everything in a house fire and had an amazing collection (jerseys and cards). Any chance for a RT? Maybe even a few cards 😉 Thank you, it means the world. https://t.co/Rkr0fgN4Cx@brockington42 @LukaUpdates @KarlTowns @dallasmavs talent is talent@mcuban  arrogance has the @dallasmavs in a spot after years of negligence that they can’t recover from. @luka7doncic will leave after this contract  because he can’t put a competitive team together. No trade capital and no draft capital.  He is solely to blame and it kills himSame……@dallasmavs now it’s just utter disappointment. https://t.co/J0AXyz8lLC@TasMelas Soooooo @dallasmavs, whatcha got?I would love to see Ben in Dallas. Mavericks need a shake up and an elite defender and another play maker. https://t.co/v4WHcOHyBV@jalengreenbetta @packersloren @AmyT917 @dallasmavs @Coreboar @FIizop @xk_tweets @AZ_Brittney @SC30WRLD @Jack37512 @SpoonOfZeke Thanks goatsA few of the @NBA scouts in attendance for tonight’s #mubb game include:

This type of one of a kind fan art is more than a topshot moment, is fan appreciation at its finest!!@dallasmavs por favor https://t.co/sux2TJUFh6@wviclaunch_bob @vo7tage @dallasmavs I mean.. he ran a historically efficient offense 2 years ago and the 8th best offense last year. I think he knows how to get others involved. However, I don't think there's much of a game plan this year. Just guys out there playing and running.To those worried about my Kane Stance, it’s highly unlikely he will be a Dallas Stars at the end of the day.

1. It doesn’t hurt to go and scout players who have off the field issues, Cowboys did with Aldon Smith and Mavericks did as well with Delonte West.Dallas #Mavericks superstar #LukaDoncic will not play Sunday against the Oklahoma City Thunder due to left ankle soreness, the team announced. 🏀 🤕🤕 #NBATwitter  https://t.co/5sUN217psa@dallasmavs Ummmm we aren't real fans here.@FundamentallySD @mcuban sign him and get Luka some help @dallasmavs@dallasmavs @NBA2K @kporzee What is he pointing at?
