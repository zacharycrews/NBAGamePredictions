I know, for instance, that only within the last 2 years has Tom Brady eclipsed the amount of championships Otto Graham won.So whenever we beat the Spurs in San Antonio we make the playoffs@CWilliamson44 That’s David Robinson’s home….. without The Admiral, Tim Duncan wouldn’t have had a San Antonio Spurs to play for.
