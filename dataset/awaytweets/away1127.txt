By the way, the Wizards are the best team in the NBA. They don’t need an all star head coach or a good offense to win games. Enjoy watching the Washington Wizards dominate this decade@warriors Lost to the wizards lmao this team is so trash 

All the warriors fans were like “our defense is bad because Draymond is out wait until he comes back”

He’s been back and they still suck 😂Enough is enough.  @warriors just put DGreen on the bench.  It is sad to watch.  He's hurting the team.   If he's good coaching or motivating others, let him do that.   But cut his minutes, he allows defenses to double team a shooter. @NBA@warriors ADIOS, Golden State! You have played your fans for YEARS (myself included) and I am taking a stand to your front office, roster, and any and every being that’s employed to your company. This marks the end of a 30+ year journey, but I am happily taking my fandom to Washington .The Golden State Warriors are 1-5 since Marcus Smart dove.@warriors That’s it! I’ve finally had it! I can’t keep supporting my tinpot NBA franchise Golden State Warriors because we are finished and trash.

I’m going to Washington where they know how to run a mega dynasty@warriors damn y’all this ass without steph ?@warriors I KNOW I speak for all the Warriors fans when I say we are poverty. This team is terribly coached and we have a dynamo defence. It just pains me that this trash offense continues to hold us back, especially 30 and 11. Send Curry and Klay immediately to the minors or trade them.@warriors @NBCSAuthentic Worst season from the warriors 💔@dbs408 @warriors The immortal Claude from AFTV.

This is a serious problem. We didn't have Steph, but the wizards are missing Beal and Kuzma. Look at the Grizzlies smoking everyone without JA.I don’t care how many points @warriors score, they will go home in the first round if the defense that was top 5 doesn’t return asap! Point blank man up and stop being soft/uninspired to defend with focus!! #NBA #NBA75 #Warriors #Defense #stepup #basketball@warriors Losing shit throwing me off@nucero8 @warriors Oh word? https://t.co/AkmoYTCIyJ@warriors Are they competing against themselves and no one playing good defense?  38/89 field goals and 8/33 3 pointers.  Help your teammates.  Or be comfortable falling below 3rd seed and cruising out of the playoffs, first round.  Not Warriors game skill.@warriors People were saying having Dray back was gonna solve everything lmao@warriors please get it together fast!!!! 😩😫@warriors Actually very impressed with Dubs. They are really very strong going to the paint. A small ball unit even. They can win games just doing this.@warriors Is it me or are we back in the 90's losing @warriors 🤷🏽?@warriors Please start Looney next game, I beg@markhaynesnba @WarriorNationCP The Actual @warriors problem is defense!
Offensive they have.
The problem is how to stop the team in the same way Warriors did at the beginning of this season?

Warriors fans are so rotten sometimes.@warriors suckReality check for the Golden State Warriors…on the verge of another 5 game losing streak! Not sure they can make a deep run playing defense like they have been. #DubNation@warriors Ratio@A2usman @warriors Stop attacking people with your selfish agenda. He is already showing a lot of development and meanwhile, this is a rookie you are talking about blame the short-handedness of the team not attacking the rookie who has hardly played. Not a good look on you@CJEvansLWOSport @Corkey910 @warriors They play their heart out and at a fast pace, no ball hogging or slow traffic control. They also adapt better in shot selection, notice when the rookies play, if the 3 pt shot isn’t hitting, they drive to the paint.@warriors Another overall dreadful team shooting performance, and terrible defensive effort. Thompson and Poole are just too inconsistent, and Curry has been shooting 30% from 3-Pt range since Thanksgiving. Winning a series in the playoffs will be difficult for this team.@warriors Good luck for the next three games,,I hope they won't get blown out,,but their playoff seeding is in danger now to be honest,they might lose their homecourt advantage for the 1st round,ending 5th or 6th..@Corkey910 @warriors Because our coach is Steve Kerr@warriors The As a Warriors fan Im calling it like it is we're playing like SHT anytime we have to rely on Damion Lee lets me know we're in trouble@warriors Draymond is useless on the court......@mdp_78 @Ipumpwhitechick @warriors @KlayThompson We were during the middle of the season@warriors Steph took this roster without Klay to 2nd seed,  now, without Steph,  this roster with Draymond, Klay cannot beat the worst team in the league Magic (15 seed),  and 32-42 Wizards? !!!!@warriors I am trying to find an excuse for @SteveKerr I honestly think he might still be heavily medicated  from his back situation . The substitution patterns that he put on the floor in crunch time is delusional ,with Damien Lee getting so much minutes. @warriors@gswbrasil2022c1 @warriors Imagine thinking the Warriors can avoid getting beat by 35 by Memphis, let alone winning.@GrantLiffmann I don't want any excuses from him.. they're saying he feels good and he dont want to come back if not 100% healthy,,so I don't wanna hear any excuses from him or the @warriors ..@fromchicagoto @warriors Enjoy this block.@CJEvansLWOSport @warriors I have more trust in Poole leading this team to victory. Won’t be surprised if win tomorrow, even if we don’t, the team will put a genuine effort and fight to stay in the game.The @warriors (48-27) fall to the @WashWizards 123-115. Poole scored a game high 26pts for #dubnation but was only 1-10 from deep.@BurnerOfNba @warriors Why the fuck didn’t moody play?@warriors Tomorrow the tweet is gonna say “not our night.” I was so excited about this season, right now I don’t think we make it pass the first round of playoffs.@ScharffReece69 @warriors Half of the hurt brothers 🤪@warriors y’all trashhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh 😭@warriors Sadly@TylerLe46616042 @warriors @Verizon Why do they need to be at their best?

Enough of these back-at-it posts. You can decide to let the bench play all the remaining games so we know we are resting for the playoffs. Because it's the same game attitude, same laissez-faire approach, no hunger, no desire... it is worrying.@warriors If Steph is not fully healthy by first round i see sweep coming our way@A2usman @warriors He’s been playing fucking good dummy@warriors It's ridiculous not to sign a substitute center.@DunkinTae @warriors even tho y’all loss, this makes me happy seeing dolo sad@TCruz_215 @warriors kerr : I am happy with our situation and we are trying to learn how to play basketballIf I'm Steve i shut down steph,klay,dray and andre for the rest of the season including playoffs. Were done!!!!!!
@warriorsEh @the_bmatt… it is TRULY a sad, SAD day when the Golden State Warriors turn into the Lakers. Can’t even be trusted on the ML. 

Yuck.@RatiodbyJordan @warriors why are u bringing dray down to make steph look good@TylerLe46616042 @warriors @Verizon You know take it easy on Kerr until your in his shoes. What I’ve heard from you guys is that all your basketball knowledge we could write on the head of a pin and still have room left over. So until you have a bunch of NBA titles maybe you should SHUT UP or become a laker fan.@warriors Why the fuck didn’t moody play? He’s better than Lee@warriors Why Lee still playing? He scored only 3 points, Poole had a bad day and scored 26 points, someone help Poole and Klay.@warriors Steve Kerr resign now before PLAYOFFS😤😤😤@dorothylizious @warriors cuz they suck it is simple.@warriors Without curry, this team is nothing.@warriors lose 🤦🏻‍♂️@AdmireIIII @warriors Ratio@warriors We can’t win@warriors Why the Dubs shoot the 3 over &amp; over when it is not going in??  The team we love is done for this season.  Anyone can now beat the Dubs!  Can't shoot the 3 &amp; refuse to stop shooting them. Who is at fault?  The coaches or the players? Next year must have a big center.@temetnosce730 @tutycrf @warriors Well yes now we just need to survive to the playoffs somehow and stay fit I also dont get why Moody didnt get minutes but it just was like that a bad night or a couple of them  it happens@Suns go to 61-14 with a 10 point  win   over the Philadelphia 76ers @sixers 114 – 104 next up Golden State Warriors @warriors #PHXvsGSW  #RALLYTHEVALLEY@MOBBIN44 @warriors Fucking scrubs@warriors No Kuminga Moody why? Draymond is a combined -43 over the last 2 games and his podcasting has never been better. This is not a Steph issue this is a coaching and front office issue. This team is getting out competed by less talent.@MOBBIN44 @warriors Trash team they always chokeLet’s go @warriors. Keep grinding and growing. I’m proud to be upset with the team in the 3rd seed, when people were saying they’d be a 6-9 seed. Injuries suck, but I’m hopeful things will improve. What’s meant to be will be.Done watching basketball @warriors https://t.co/ueLBoY6ljYThe @Warriors really got worked by the Wizards… https://t.co/AXNAWKsA8R@warriors This loss is not about no Curry. 
The scoring from Wiggins, Thompson, and Poole was good enough to win. PORTER’s support was decent. Nobody else. Off night from Draymond. 8-33 on 3’s is not good enough to win when giving up 16-28 3’s on the other side.

Silver lining: 31-39 FT@warriors Fuck Kerr
Fuck Lee

The winner from the Dallas Mavericks vs Utah Jazz game will have sole possession of 4th seed and be 2 games behind 3rd seed Warriors. 

GSW next three games: Grizzlies, Suns, Jazz.@_CoronaLime_ @warriors @Verizon Yeah you know you guys weren’t to hard on Kerr when he was winning championships. I have one thought on head coaches either trust them or fire them. You geniuses don’t have a clue why he’s doing what he does but he looks pretty competent to me so go rout for the lakers we don’t@warriors Stop playing DLee! He’s unreliable on offense and a liability on defense. Why is he playing extensively instead of Moody? What’s going on with this coaching staff? They are allowing corner 3s in many of the games including against the wizards. 😤I hope everyone understands why fans, including myself, are at a high level of concern because if the Golden State Warriors are really gunning for a championship this year, these things should not happen. Championship teams don't have this kind of a stretch and so many injuries.@warriors If Kuminga doesn’t play 25 minutes tomorrow night, I don’t know what Kerr is thinking. JK played 14 minutes with ONLY one foul.@warriors Kerr is the problem 
-2 games B2B starts kuminga and he plays only 14 and 13 min.
- bench looney? He was +11 against hawks and +5 today
- draymond was - 20 both games 
- no moody or beli playing time knowing we need shooters
- doesn’t use GP2 to his advantage@warriors Draymond Green is OUT OF SHAPE, NOT FOCUSED, PLAYING AWFUL@markhaynesnba The @warriors problem is defense.
Ofende they have.
At the beginning of the season Warriors were in the first position because their defense. Now any team can score a lot of points against Warriors because the Warriors defense is too bad. They need to improve the defense to win!@warriors I'm tired of Damion Lee ruining this franchise@UltimateGswfan @warriors And they are 1-7 lol@warriors tell draymond to stop being a diva and play basketball@warriors We’re most likely not doing shit in the playoffs this year sad to say but it’s very true 🤦🏻‍♂️@ArtButSports @KlayThompson @warriors @NBCSWarriors @WarriorsPR @artistgauguin Notice, no headband.

Very difficult! @Money23Green https://t.co/ONBpsfb2Jt@warriors decided to play defense in the last 2 minutes... nice work dubs.@warriors might as well just rest everyone. memphis will win in a blowout either way@BaykaluW @tutycrf @warriors Damion missed ft in the clutch time, Kerr only gave just 14 minutes to Kuminga and still confused about the team rotation
Fuck both, they don't deserve defense.@GoIdenState @warriors Im devastated!! I really am!!!! What the Hell are we doing???? Now we are in dangerous territory!!!!!!!!!! Come on Warriors!!@warriors Trade Klay while he still has value@warriors Ratio@warriors What even is this team, like we have the whole team except Steph we should have been able to at least win against Spurs, Magic and tonight hell even fucking Hawks we should have won but on that second half everyone fell asleep...Man this fucking sucks man😪 https://t.co/ZCJ0PmeYb0@warriors We gotta do something, maybe add Enes Freedom and let go Chiozza@warriors Honestly though, what’s wrong with y’all@warriors What in the actual fuck... https://t.co/oexT2wzoJH@warriors LMAO YOU LOST TO THE WIZARDS@AMBRYTH0MAS @warriors They are not they are 9th in the standings they might not even make the playoffs@warriors Curry is the only reason the team was looking like a championship team with Steph best team in leauge without him worst now who’s the mvp@warriors we suck ffs@warriors We’re finishedThe Warriors defensive continued struggling and no one outside of Klay, Poole, and Wiggins scored 15 points. Even against the Wizards, Golden State’s stretch of mediocrity continued. https://t.co/LBKJ8pMrWO@warriors I thought when Dray comes back they will be better defensively? What happened? Now who all of you saying Dray is the heart and soul of the warriors?@warriors down game for Kuminga. Bummer@warriors And yet we losing to the mf Wizards?🤨@warriors Can the rookies, G league players and GP2 play tomorrow with Looney?

Klay, Poole, Wiggs just scored at least 23 points but we still came up short. I still believe we can rally in the playoffs. But, man, these reg season games are tough to watch 😢@warriors If i am going to be honest with you ,in my own humble opinion without being sentimental of course, without offending anyone who thinks differently from my own point of view,but also by looking into this matter in distinctive perspective ,i would like to say i have nothing to sayPLEASE @warriors REST THE VETERANS TOMORROW@YoIoBurner @warriors Shut up they are a w franchise@James88085715 @warriors Go get some bitches@warriors Waive Lee and sign QC@warriors 58 pt blow out from Mem tomorrow - no Ja.....won't matter a bit.

Oh yeah also 3rd seed in the western conference.@warriors Not our night today? 🤡Steve Kerr @SteveKerr 
Golden State Warriors @warriors 
STOP SHOOTING ALL THOSE 3s, and SHOOT MORE 2s. Teams are beating your by 2, 4, 6, 10 or 12 points because they are shooting more 2s and your missing your 3s. And your playing catch up after missing 29 to 40 3pts shots. DUMB@warriors @KlayThompson Jordan Poole threw away this game....really??? If you aren't making 3s don keep fuc***g shooting them...and as the playmaker 1 assist is unacceptable. @SteveKerr keep giving him all that liberty to do whatever he wants and you'll be eliminated in the 1st round 🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬Y’all getting punked by Corey Kispert @warriors @SteveKerrSee Damion Lee too ah Awurade! @warriors chale ship him to the G LeagueThere’s a player representing the Golden State Warriors right now who’s itching to hit the locker room so he can shout out LeBron for hitting 37kEvery ref that calls the  @warriors game are trash! @NBA #blindAF#GSWvsWAS if you're earning a check and you play for the @warriors simply wake up each morning, look to the heavens and say "thank you lord for steph!" that's before you flex on ig...Let him go after this season @warriorsCan’t blame him.

We're in real shithole rn.@warriors @KlayThompson Did Klay just airballed?Steve Kerr @SteveKerr 
Golden State Warriors @warriors 
Your will win only 45 to 55% of your games if your keep shooting 3pts shoot. It does not matter if Curry is in or not. 2 pts shooting will give your more pts than shooting 3s.

Assuming Klay does not play tomorrow (34 minutes in this game) Memphis may have a change to essentially clinch the 2 seed Monday night.@DogSurfRoadshow @warriors I think it’s time to shutdown Draymond for the year like they did to Wiseman.
