Bet slip link: https://t.co/RsqQIjpoAG https://t.co/pYaHYDndz9So did @trailblazers and so did @dallasmavs … their offensive efficiency went waaay down when Seth Curry left. https://t.co/EbXKLEXJiEPortland Trail Blazers (24-34, 10th in the Western Conference) vs. Memphis Grizzlies (41-18, third in the Western Conference) https://t.co/6Gjyb0MBny@stephenasmith I seen a video clip you did about the Portland Trail Blazers beating the Lakers with practically no one and players who have the title “have bags, will travel” all the while the Lakers even though didn’t have Westbrook playing still had LeBron and AD.Combo is  pure. @MassGovernor @MassGovernor @trailblazers @BushFdn @acholi @RailaOdinga (I came home). @Luokenya
@MassGovernor @MassGovernor @MassGovernor 310; dangerous 007 https://t.co/g9P0ngo1UO@trailblazers @blazersforreal Block from Justice = cake from Chauncey.@Eraypetro @trailblazers Why would he wait when he is on the trip?  And I saw Dennis is out again tomorrow. Glad to hear Eric is cleared!@CathyCadenf @trailblazers I read that Eric has been cleared to play physically, however we may not see him join the team until they wrap the road trip up. Dennis still healing from the elbow injury but I’m not seeing a timeline. Maybe tomorrow, fingers crossed!@CathyCadenf @Joeingles7 @trailblazers I’m not sure how all that works.@PoetAndrews @trailblazers Sorry you had Covid .. I hope you’re recovered. Please take care of yourself@crunk2158 @Joeingles7 @trailblazers I heard though he can’t resign with Utah right?  He has to wait a year??Great conversation around the @trailblazers on the @JackedRamsays cast with @DannyMarang and @BrandonSprague! #RipCity 

https://t.co/LJ5VRHDQZ2 https://t.co/tzJy86U86D@1080TheFAN @trailblazers When do they play…I have no ideaI’ve been on the @AnferneeSimons train from the get go and dude is starting’ to ball out regularly! This kid is damn good. Love watching him play. @trailblazers #RipCity https://t.co/OSByyd6KEBBlazers heard tank, but interpreted it as war. Not talking shit tho, I love it. 😂 Lmao I’ll get ant tattoo if they get a ship this year. @AnferneeSimons @trailblazers let’s go boys@SpursUpNext What if the @trailblazers had chosen @Jumpman23"Butt slappin' Nurk is the best Nurk"

info: https://t.co/cRUzVUnyx0 https://t.co/4MUlTGTjWg@trailblazers @NCRMuseum Wow… amazing coach!@1080TheFAN @trailblazers It’s a blast to watch guys move in and know this is a huge shot at minutes.  The starting five is currently playing for contracts, but they have already started playing together.  Tanking?  Nah.  Running the break and playing defense without crushing the cap?  Maybe a new way…@trailblazers @NCRMuseum Know it well@Gwennieshaw @trailblazers Congrats, Gwen!!@blazershater @trailblazers @NCRMuseum deadass took the team on a field trip lmao@pbrowntv @bigjohnNEP @trailblazers Who’s the kid with all the hair? 😁@PDXjay Jeff McInnis added 5 more assists off the bench in the OT win that night, that made 6 @trailblazers with 4 or more assists in the game.Took a red eye last night to Memphis to go to the @trailblazers vs @memgrizz game tomorrow. I can’t wait! #RipCity@trailblazers @NCRMuseum @trailblazers wtc that crewneck!?@RIP_CTZN @Dame_Lillard @trailblazers Dames three point shooting paired with Ants ball movement would be a thing of beauty.@SpursUpNext The Portland Trail Blazers have a real training staff and don’t ruin the careers of Brandon Roy and Greg Oden. 

My biggest what it is Ben Wilson.@ZG3II @FullSailBrewing It's not a short drive but it's absolutely worth it.

@WidmerBrothers is my favorite in Portland. 

Not too far from the Rose Garden, @trailblazers@PelicansNBA @socios 3J making 3s every which way — we @trailblazers fans want @CJMcCollum back 🙏

Hey @trailblazers we should get a drum line too!!!@trailblazers @NCRMuseum Where's Josh Hart?I love @Joeingles7 and I really hope he resigns with the @trailblazers but even I know there is no way he is going to move his family to Portland while rehabbing his acl and knowing he is a free agent this summer.  Why would anyone do that to their family.@NCRMuseum Thank you so much for having us today, @NCRMuseum 🖤

What’s his future in Portland? https://t.co/Opnt6X57Ll@trailblazers @NCRMuseum I really like himThe Portland Trail Blazers have started to establish a new identity. How will Damian Lillard fit into the fold?

Weird sensation to see the new GM blowtorch the squad only to realize that maybe teams hated Olshey so much that they wouldn't even hear him, is Joe Cronin
winning by default or is he just this damn good? I keep Joe FT if up to me https://t.co/HRb4s5nr4H@trailblazers @NCRMuseum what did he say? captions?
