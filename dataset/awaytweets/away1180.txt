If anyone looking for help ect dm me@Free_Spirit2972 @jhardy575 @hornets Please no. I wish all Carolina alum success, but it is bad for Charlotte and bad for the player if they aren’t fitting a specific need or are the best available. Maybe Manek fits a need; I don’t follow the Hornets closely enough, but not just because he is a Tar Heel we like.@nba_paint can you make some @hornets merch/designs? 👀I heard a rumor that @PhilConstantino will be hosting the @hornets pre/half/post coverage for the next few nights.

Did you not know that? That game vs the Hornets in Charlotte right before the Pandemic says helloBecause with that last scenario, Hornets would only be tied with the Hawks and they hold the tiebreaker over Charlotte. 

It actually benefits the Hornets to have the Nets keep pace with them because Charlotte owns the tiebreaker over Brooklyn and the 3-way tiebreaker. https://t.co/9eZ3JCTIZXCharlotte Hornets – Miami Heat | AI Analysis https://t.co/AdqPK96gJ9@alannadeau2016 Doesn’t matter.
