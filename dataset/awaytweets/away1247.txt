It‚Äôs safe to assume that number improves. Heat shoot 39% vs the hawks on the season and they shot 47% in Game 1.

Also, they are way better than the underperforming @ATLHawks of this season.ATL Hawks need to remember that we gritted out to get to game 6 of the ECF with the same damn team! Yeah the East got better with some reshuffling, but we are not trying to hear that! We should have gotten better as players as well. @ATLHawks are y'all gonna turn on or be off?Check out 2017 Panini Status #134 John Collins Atlanta Hawks RC Rookie PSA 10 GEM MINT  https://t.co/yPLdA8CW4Y via @eBay #NBA #AtlantaHawks #Atlanta #Hawks #Basketball #PSAAny of my @ATLHawks.

So i can meet everyone. #TrueToAtlanta@Reese929IndAtl @MiamiHEAT @ATLHawks @TheTraeYoung False about the leg‚Ä¶ ain‚Äôt no way in hell he did that to intentionally hurt Trae. It was a 100% hustle play for a loose ball. You could see Lowry literally talking to Trae afterwards with concern. The throat thing I can‚Äôt comment on because I don‚Äôt think I saw it.@SouthBeachMamba @MiamiHEAT @ATLHawks @TheTraeYoung üòÖüòÖüòÖüòÖüòÖüòÖ

@SouthBeachMamba 

True or False:

Lowry was on Bounty time wit the Diving at the leg and the Elbow to the Throat push into the Power Forward?
