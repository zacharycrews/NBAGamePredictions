It’s safe to assume that number improves. Heat shoot 39% vs the hawks on the season and they shot 47% in Game 1. Their efficiency will more than likely drop.Aight @ATLHawks time to get our lick back....@ATLHawks hope to rebound in Game 2 against

I hope the refs do a better job tonight!!!@juulz5293 @HeatMakeMeSad @NBA @MiamiHEAT @ATLHawks Ain’t nobody wanna watch the heat crush the hawks by 30 again lol. Just from an entertainment standpoint, it’s a hard sell for me that watching Trae get shit on is a better viewing experience than the Ja v Ant experience@NBA @MiamiHEAT @ATLHawks Heat in 4The Atlanta Hawks will take on the Miami Heat at the FTX Arena in Game 2 of their first-round series.

#BelieveAtlantaOn this day in sports history April 19, Atlanta Hawks Small Forward Dominique Wilkins scored 50 Points in a 137-125 win against the Detroit Pistons in Game 2 in the 1st Round of the NBA Playoffs in 1986.@ATLHawks @MiamiHEAT @FTXArena @NBAonTNT @BallySportsSO @929TheGame @Hooters The Atlanta Hawks must consider playing Chaundee Brown Jr in this series against the Miami heat. This guy is physical, has confidence, and can go toe to toe with guys like Jimmy Butler!!! Play Chaundee Brown!!!On this day in sports history April 19, the Los Angeles Lakers swept the Atlanta Hawks to advance to the NBA Finals for the 3rd consecutive year in 1970.@OGToni3_ @ATLHawks @MiamiHEAT @FTXArena @NBAonTNT @BallySportsSO @929TheGame @Hooters Nah cuz when we lose yh we are frauds etc but when win oh they had no rest. U can't be using it as an excuse for that performance on Sunday@jackcameron987 @ATLHawks @MiamiHEAT @FTXArena @NBAonTNT @BallySportsSO @929TheGame @Hooters Literally an NBA scheduling issue not a seeding issue.
