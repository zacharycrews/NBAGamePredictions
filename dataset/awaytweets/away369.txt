We're going to be coming to see you when you play the @Bucks on April 3rd. Any chance of an autograph? She's very excited!@Bucks should go get @dekker@BazookaDhb @gcp2000 @BroadwayJay5 @nathanmarzion @Bucks Exactly what I mean. It would be an awkward fit imo@FrancescaHongWI @Bucks Well the noodles were also fire, and it's still fuck robin vos@blasian1nvasion @Bucks Giannis would look so hot in that 🥵🥵@dchipman10 @adamcappellein6 @epnohelty I know, I’m just being a smart ass 😂. All things equal I’d still take Turner on the Bucks over Sabonis. All he’d do in Milwaukee is take shots away from others or become a shell of his production. I see no net positive in adding him to this rosterBucks x Blasian #NBA2K22 @Bucks https://t.co/f7oDNNaOLS@Lady_Mac_vG @gcp2000 @BroadwayJay5 @nathanmarzion @Bucks Take up space offensively, right? That actually makes sense. Turner plays down low on offense. Sabonis can shoot from the perimeter. Yeah i get that.@investorchales @Bucks Cool now you can start earning ratiocoin@gcp2000 @BroadwayJay5 @BazookaDhb @nathanmarzion @Bucks I get the upside of Turner for defense but I think he’ll take up space where Giannis is most effective.  I don’t see that with Sabonis.  Both are improve our team thoRecap: Bucks 112, Cavs 104 (or, Slugfest in Milwaukee) – NBA News https://t.co/WnbiIi9rS8@BenjaminNuttin @Bucks 🙏 that was all Scout! I was on noodles last night ✌The Heat will try to turn things around on Wednesday night against the defending NBA champion Milwaukee Bucks at FTX Arena. The problem is Miami will be without Bam Adebayo and possibly Jimmy Butler on Wednesday for the fourth time in five games. https://t.co/LcaisvfsH4@ToniXBolomboy @BradleyThorla @Hargoat13 @GameTechSudios @lisapease He'll surpass LeBron by the end of his career and everyone was saying he won't win a ring in Milwaukee before he actually did lmfao. The Bucks are still a top 2-3 team in the NBA, so I don't see what's so unrealistic about him winning more rings in Milwaukee.@Bucks @Giannis_An34 Brick 🧱@BLACKMESSlAH From Illinois and close to Milwaukee so a Bulls/Bucks own also. Good all around.@gcp2000 @BazookaDhb @Lady_Mac_vG @nathanmarzion @Bucks So I take it you want Turner for the defensive upside?@BroadwayJay5 @gcp2000 @Lady_Mac_vG @nathanmarzion @Bucks he's an upgrade offensively. Not defensively. This team won a title because it can defend.  Sabonis would hurt them in this regard.@Bucks @Jrue_Holiday11 @boogiecousins Love the team work and work ethic of the small market teams like Bucks, Brewers, Packers
@Brewers 
@packers@BroadwayJay5 @BazookaDhb @Lady_Mac_vG @nathanmarzion @Bucks That’s great, he also wouldn’t benefit the bucks as much as turner would@dekker @BKBasketbol @OliviaDekker Good Luck play well the Milwaukee Bucks could use you later on in the season@Bucks LOOK AT JAVONTE MAN🥰@bucks I need a bucks logo weighted blanket for my gf for Christmas help me out and make some of those.@RexChapman Met Oscar Robertson at Bucks Sixers in Milwaukee in February 2020, Wouldn't have ever imagined it'd be my last game for over a year https://t.co/NGtqWW3yGPFuture Business Leaders of America (FBLA) members attended the National Fall Leadership Conference in Milwaukee.

Bucks are quietly having a fantastic season; 16-9, good for 3rd in the East! 🦌 https://t.co/fnYp5llPif#MIAvsMIL
