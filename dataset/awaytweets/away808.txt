Happy with their expedience.@Slaughter369 @Kenneth63372372 @Suns I disagree bro.Mikal misses the wide open perimeter shots.I love that he locks guys down, but he also needs to make his open shots.Teams are leaving him open purposely at the perimeter because they are daring him to consistently make those shots,and he’s not.Agree with the rest🤝The Phoenix Suns are 43-10. They lose 19% of the time.  The odds of beating them 4 times in a row is 0.13%.

If they could up those number consistently, then we would be alright,but I don’t see that happening. Hence, why I feel the Suns should get a guard that can shoot, and move the ball. I wish Shamet panned out better.🤷🏻‍♂️😂@Suns @sixers @BALLYSPORTSAZ @az_mejor Don’t blow a big lead pleaseToday's NBA Consensus (So Far):

Played a portion of his early career in Phoenix, familiarity is there. Plus, the Suns would improve their backup PG spot significantly.

Nobody can deny how good this Suns team is. They don’t have the best record in the league by fluke.

Bulls did cut the lead from 27 to 9 but Phoenix ran away with it from there.

Truly grateful 💜🧡💜 https://t.co/M6CitXsXj3@Suns Good win. I wished Monty would have play the bench minutes laters. Could have been costly but i understand why he did that with a game tonight then thursday. Amazing Booker@jointhefight20 @Suns I know right!
