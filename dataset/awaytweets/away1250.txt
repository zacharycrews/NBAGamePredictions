Curry is too exploitable, Drummond is trash defensively, and the Celtics are too deep@thatphillyman @BrooklynNets If I was really on some degen shit I would bet KD over 7.5 in the first quarter.

#OTnba #NBAPlayoffs https://t.co/PC3DSat6MYIt's all Brooklyn in Game 2 at @PointsBetUSA. Everyone's looking for a repeat of the last game in each series where the Nets, Sixers and Bulls all covered. Give 'em all the points. Except that bucket with Toronto. You can keep that one. https://t.co/0ta8gJSTtMBuilt for the challenge. 

#NetsLevel https://t.co/f6h1IZGRXyThe Boston Celtics showed they have the game plan to beat the Brooklyn Nets.

If they make it out of this series, they've got all the necessary pieces and firepower to make a deep playoff run, and they stack up with any other team in the Eastern Conference.

👉 https://t.co/HPerd0YH43 @wagertalkThe Nets are avoiding going down 2-0 against the Celtics in Boston tonight. The last time Brooklyn went down 2-0 was the 2015 first round series vs. Atlanta (lost 4-2).

Kyrie Irving is a perfect 5-0 in first round series in his career. Kevin Durant is 9-1 in first round series. https://t.co/MEBI1ow5h5NBA PICKS

#BoosterClub@BrooklynNets My fucking boys💫😤#Sports: Brooklyn Nets' Kyrie Irving Fined for Obscene Gestures

Brooklyn Nets guard Kyrie Irving has been fined £38,000 by the NBA for "making obscene gestures on the court and directing profane language to the stands" in their opening playoff game. https://t.co/IMufTQdjS9@GladWarriorsFan @BrooklynNets @warriors He will resigned with warriors this years#QuoteOfTheDay "Stay out of their way, stay above the fray"...@MadDogUnleashed referring to @KyrieIrving's (@BrooklynNets) "obscene gestures" to @celtics "obnoxious fans". @FirstTake @espn 🏀 https://t.co/0nVK0fKAPo🚨 NEW VIDEO 🚨

Though the 115-114 loss appeared narrow on the surface, the Nets were outworked by the Celtics in Game 1 of the 1st-round series.

I analyzed what went wrong for Brooklyn and some possible adjustments moving forward.

Where they at? Bc he been a huge player from us AND I FUCKING CALLED IT@Carter33699732 @NyyBkn13 @Joyy_pubgm @BrooklynNets Bruce prefers not to shoot the 3 unless he's like super wide open. Plus he's giving up size in  comparison to Griffin. Even if Griffin doesn't hit a 3 all game, the "threat" of him shooting a 3 still good enough for me.@BrooklynNets Legacy game@KlotzbachJoshua Not really. Just like it when logic prevails. For instance, heckling an NBA player who isn't at an MLB game, seems very illogical. Also, since there is no connection between the Minnesota Twins and the Brooklyn Nets, it seems illogical. https://t.co/ElrNrCBFFn@GladWarriorsFan @KevBruyne17 @BrooklynNets @warriors If warriors win he might sign somewhere else for money@Tony994445271 @BrooklynNets @HSpecialSurgery Ye but two most likely starters on this still isn’t great#NBA Brooklyn vs. Boston #FreePick from Covers Expert Marc Lawrence.

Last couple of games he played he was knocking down 3’s. Let’s be real for a second. He has gotten inconsistent playing time. Asking a player to shoot 40% with little playing time is asking for too much@CudiThaGOAT @Rainn_LoverBoy @BrooklynNets Yeah true but they just didn’t use the mismatches properly I feel they could’ve gone at him more that game guess we’ll see this game@BrooklynNets @HSpecialSurgery Ik we all bummed about Ben but can we just take a second to appreciate how empty this is after a season where like 4 names used to be the minimum@chealseagbeint @Rainn_LoverBoy @BrooklynNets Yeah, the nets playing 2 small guards at all times definitely hurts them but Patty wasn't even that bad defensively when he was on the court, I think Seth guarding theis was a bigger issue@BovadaOfficial Brooklyn Nets@BrooklynNets Yessir uncle Drew back at it@CudiThaGOAT @Rainn_LoverBoy @BrooklynNets I guess so numbers don’t@BrooklynNets ramadhan kyrieBrooklyn Nets : Brooklyn Nets Office Organize Notebook | NCAA Notebook Fan Essential NFL , NBA , MLB , NHL , NCAA #61

Patty should be playing more than 12 minutes though imo, one of the best plus minuses on the team this year@CudiThaGOAT @Rainn_LoverBoy @BrooklynNets No cause obvi Nash will realise that and they will try to feed him earlier to get him going like they did with Seth how Seth was doing mostly everything then he died down cause patty is a streaky shooter just cause patty didn’t do anything game 1 doesn’t mean he won’t try to Gm 2@Carter33699732 @NyyBkn13 @Joyy_pubgm @BrooklynNets he's AS consistent as Bruce Brown so why not?@BrooklynNets - More Ball movement and less Iso esp  down the stretch

Can KD ,Kyrie &amp; the Nets
  beat Curry and the warriors in the Finals ? https://t.co/r4qCHeR4aF@TheGreatRoofini It's literally 6.5 games. Out of 82. We'd literally be above Toronto. You're trying to be literal because you know that's the only thing you have lmao We literally finished one game behind the excellent Brooklyn Nets and you trying to say we don't deserve the playoffs lmao@jonmouyal @Suns @warriors @chicagobulls @BrooklynNets I like the Wolves chances more than I do the Nuggets… lol Warriors gonna’ Warrior so long as that core stays healthy… I just hope my Bulls can get out the 1st round somehow 🥲@NBAPR @NBA @BrooklynNets @celtics Who turned that game on and then turned it off?!?

The BrooklynNets had 3 of the best current players, and Hardin punked out because it was too hard to hold the fort while KD was mending, talk about taking the path of least resistance, he wants easy street wherever he goes, Not a StandUp guy. https://t.co/s7p7wKUBYU@DarkNarcist2 @thoughtsnbball @BillyReinhardt By the national media maybe yeah. I’m talking about the Brooklyn nets and their fans.@Louie17mx @NetsBurner10 @BrooklynNets @KDTrey5 @24_camthomas @Patty_Mills @KyrieIrving Disagree? So you don’t think Clax was out of position on that last play? That last line of defense should have been Claxton the center, not Kyrie the guard.NETS FANS!!!

 #Brooklyn_Nets@mspears96 big swagu the Brooklyn nets need a 25 points from someone that is not name kyrie or kelvin durant. Because they are going to get out rebound every game.I understand he needs to be held responsible but what punishment does the fans who started the nonsense get. These athletes are human, too. It might not be practical but some of these fans need to be banned from games for their conduct as well. @KyrieIrving @BrooklynNets https://t.co/Nb2C4u1qcfsign JJ Redick @BrooklynNets@RitmoNba Lo Necesitan Ya

As a @BrooklynNets fan, I think it's important to lay similar blame on @KDTrey5 and Kyrie for pushing for a coach who has never coached before, and it shows.@championayo77 @BrooklynNets @KDTrey5 @24_camthomas @Patty_Mills @KyrieIrving You must be a Celtics fan@Bertbalt @BrooklynNets @KDTrey5 @24_camthomas @Patty_Mills @KyrieIrving I would put him on Tatum@KAscuasiati @BrooklynNets @KDTrey5 @24_camthomas @Patty_Mills @KyrieIrving That would solve most of the problems with this team. And hopefully Sean Marks learns his lesson, need bigger role players that can shoot and play defense. However Curry is a keeper.@BrooklynNets can u guys win tmm &amp; I will regret all the negative &amp; overthinking thoughts u guys put me thru on Easter &amp; past 2 days please 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽Check out Jordan NBA Statement Swingman Brooklyn Nets Mens Shorts Dri-Fit Size Large https://t.co/gg0i1QyMYA #eBay via @eBay@GladWarriorsFan @BrooklynNets @warriors boy if he played with the Nets no rest on back to backs at all lol@NetsBurner10 @BrooklynNets @KDTrey5 @24_camthomas @Patty_Mills @KyrieIrving Bad! free throws and being out of position on defense. I like what Claxton brings to this team BUT, that last play of the game, he was out of position, no way should he be double teaming Smart on the perimeter, He plays center, he should be near the basket to protect the rim@BrooklynNets @KDTrey5 @24_camthomas @Patty_Mills @KyrieIrving Why has Kyrie got a Jesus cross for an ear ring when he’s Muslim?Congratulations to ez_money_sniper (@cymmbal) who moved up 1 spot to take #7 on the Brooklyn Nets team leaderboard.
