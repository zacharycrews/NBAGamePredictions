4 - Over 240 Atlanta Hawks vs Brooklyn NetsI would love to see a @BrooklynNets Finals Against @warriors , or a @Bucks Finals against @dallasmavs@wlai @BrooklynNets @KyrieIrving Rooting for the playin scenario where Brooklyn travels to Toronto and Irving can’t play.@SteveLichtenst1 Tonight focus is on rebounds and closure learning to close out the game without making dum mistakes play hard for the whole game do not take a play off dive scramble every game is a playoff game get your mind right @BrooklynNets, @KDTrey5 I will be at the game can we jersey swapThe Florida Panthers are the team that no one in the NHL will want to play in the playoffs… 

Like the Brooklyn Nets in the NBA.

But legit.I really like De’Andre Hunter points today. He’s hit 15 points in 9 of the last 15 games and gets a good matchup against an injured Brooklyn Nets team. John Collins is still out, so we should see a good number of opportunities tonight for Hunter. #NBA #FreePicks

(With 3 key players missing)

Quit sleeping on Memphis!Brooklyn tied with ATL and Charlotte? If the Nets end up 9th or 10th and miss the playoffs it’d be crazyAll of a sudden the @NBA wants to be "transparent" about officiating.
Watching the @Suns vs @memgrizz 
&amp; They're doing pr for refs.
Which means, they know They fucked up the @BrooklynNets  vs. @Bucks game last night.
 the officials, &amp; the league has an agenda against nets. Imo. https://t.co/Axc0zsbIPU@LegionHoops How is he injured?!

I c yaKevin Durant makes honest admission after challenging ‘BROTHER’ Jayson Tatum to be a ‘killer’ https://t.co/WCwryfSMQM #BostonCeltics #BrooklynNets@KrissyCristiano @BrooklynNets @Patty_Mills @AndreDrummond @24_camthomas I hope Kyrie is aggressive and our shooters are hitting shots@MilesQBlack1 @BrooklynNets @MilesQBlack1 are you watching Grizzlies vs Suns, If U R Yur watching skilld Bigs  Griz’s bigs 58 paint points Nets don’t get paint points Irving &amp; Durant hog the ball 🏀 &amp; Jack up Jumpers nets bigs 5 touches per G same as Lakers  teams wit big name ball hogs low TEAM assists#’s@BrooklynNets @Patty_Mills @AndreDrummond @24_camthomas Tell Nash that Bruce Brown should be in the lineup at the end of close games instead of Goran. I think we lost 2 close games recently because of Goran’s late turnovers and bad shooting@SupportASDKidz @BrooklynNets KD was out Kyrie couldn’t play home, and harden was our main scorer. Before that we were 3rd seedKyrie Irving will almost assuredly play for the Brooklyn Nets next season and beyond. Should he consider making a change?  https://t.co/eUsYJgqQCU@NjTank99 Would rather see a @Mets WS, @BrooklynNets Championship, @NJDevils Cup, or @MiamiDolphins Superbowl ? Don’t let me down her Franklin.@KNadia_92 The streets need a @BrooklynNets vs @Suns finals@FAmmiranteTFJ Are you serious Frank? Man I had some bets on the Brooklyn Nets outright.I honestly think the whole eastern conference is tryna hide from playing the Brooklyn Nets in the first round. It’s honestly hilarious but understandable 😂😂@milbrewfan @GDESPOSITO08 @NetsKingdomAJ @BrooklynNets @NBA Kyrie drives all the time and never gets a call while being defended by 3 or more defenders - he is hacked but the word is out don't give Kyrie a shot at the free throw@Bucks playing mind games with the @BrooklynNets by sitting their stars. with a W tonight they would've moved into 1st in the East but instead stay in 2nd essentially tryna set up a First Round matchup with the Nets if they beat the @cavs in the Play-In.. 🤔 #ConspiracyTheories@TCIIIESQ @ItsWorve Nobody wanna bet nets bucks if they matchup 👀 I only put money on #7 for Brooklyn@BrooklynNets @Patty_Mills @AndreDrummond @24_camthomas Against the Bucks, the referee dominated everything, which is disgusting, but KD missed two lore, which is a pity.@TomBullington @chris_steller Like the Brooklyn Nets. How about the Baltimore Bleachers or Cleveland Concessions?And how are the Cleveland Cavaliers above the Brooklyn Nets I never saw that coming😂😅The East is so unreal that the Brooklyn Nets are the 8th seed@canilive47 @certifiednugget @BrooklynNets Lol sadly you never know, theres so many morons commenting.According to head coach Steve Nash, the @BrooklynNets still have no timetable for the season debut of @BenSimmons25 

Full story: https://t.co/Ywv5d2XRTc https://t.co/9iMyoxFBy4@canilive47 @certifiednugget @BrooklynNets Lol. I hope you're right@NBA 

Just rewatched the Milwaukee Bucks vs Brooklyn Nets Game from last night focusing on the 4th Quarter and Overtime. 

Countless BS Foul Calls that were completely unacceptable 

Check each of the Referee’s Bank Accounts.

The Fix was in for the Milwaukee Bucks.When the time comes, I hope @KingJames passes Kareem in the all-time scoring list in a convincing way. Not with doubt and shame like the way the @Lakers are right now. But the way @Giannis_An34 did it last night against @KDTrey5 and the @BrooklynNets - with zeal and fire.@itsjwills I think teams should have the flexibility to give their starters a break as they see fit. You shouldn't force a team to play all its best players all the time. Besides, @BrooklynNets prolly did hurt them last night.@hongtaeju2 @jarenjacksonjr_ @netsworldric @AlexIrving23 @BrooklynNets Clueless@Danneey4 @RobloxJeffSteel @HonestTrumpster @BrooklynNets Go to sleep bro you tired 😂@katerud0lph @Brooklyn__Ann @Charlotte_Stein Unless AMZ's policy changed in the few months since I last had a book returned, it's a net 0, not a negative. Still disappointing but less bad!@AhmedAa0204467 @BrooklynNets I agree that that has nothing to do with strategy@BrooklynNets Better change this jersey is a curse  always bad ending.@FDSportsbook Brooklyn Nets@JoeTheGoatArdi @BrooklynNets @Patty_Mills @AndreDrummond @24_camthomas Lmfaooo for real !!! 😩😭@GDESPOSITO08 @NetsKingdomAJ @BrooklynNets @NBA 2 “superstars” that love shooting jumpersWhen the Brooklyn Nets weirdos take over my circle 😂 https://t.co/WwDt6zqomK@sonnIBrown1188 @BrooklynNets all those roster gaps all year we still on track@hoeforsho69 @Joe_Makar @dbearak The Nets have been helping us organize our seating into one fixed section since ‘14-‘15 and the created The BK Block section in ‘18-‘19 to serve as a permanent home for The Brooklyn Brigade and similarly-minded energetic, positive, and LOUD Nets fansI’m All in for @BrooklynNets 💯 fuk the other side.@NetsKingdomAJ It’s disgusting how Giannis literally gets any and all calls..opposing players don’t even need to touch him. Side note  The @BrooklynNets have to be the only team in the history of the @NBA that get absolutely no calls while having 2 superstars@BrooklynNets @KDTrey5 You r being double teamed so you have to change how you play the game. As soon as you receive the pass give it right back and look for the pass 2 come right back 2 u. Don’t hold the ball on the 1st pass becuz the triple team is coming.Give it up get it back@BrooklynNets Loss.  Gutless lossBrooklyn Nets superstar Kevin Durant recently explained how his coverage with the Golden State Warriors was ‘unfair.’  https://t.co/wlCTyrHqLg@whohasskyemail @BrooklynNets I never said that. Did I accidentally imply it? Maybe. But it's not insanity cause I thought the refs were bad, it was insanity cause I couldn't believe we got him in that position.

and yes, I know the Nets aren't exactly famous for their paint defense...https://t.co/G4GHTnb33c
