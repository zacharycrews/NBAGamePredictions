Step up @WarriorsPR!RT @wojespn: Golden State has agreed to trade D'Angelo Russell to Minnesota for a deal that includes Andrew Wiggins, a 2021 protected first-round pick and a 2022 second-round pick, league sources tell ESPN.

#Astroport has the best space bar for me to chill around!@warriors @TISSOT This was probably before @Rick24Barry refined it to take the wrist out of the equation. I believe in later years the form ended with him bringing his wrists together. This resulted in more consistency in form/backspin.This has been too long of a stretch to not have @warriors game 🥱@BigFan6628 @warriors @TISSOT Horrible free throw shooters would rather be horrible than shoot underhanded. Rick offered to help Shaq. Shaq told him he’d rather shoot 0% than underhanded. If you’ve ever seen Rick actually teach his method, you’ll see why it’s effective. It removes so many variables.@warriors do something fun like this https://t.co/XBBSQ57JlYI miss y’all @warriors 🤧🤍Oklahoma City Thunder - Golden State Warriors

The NBA should not tolerate a callous disregard for ethic cleansing and genocide.  @mehdirhasanGot a new human shitstain for us to boycott @azsweetheart013 I just got educated on the Chinese concentration camps targeting Muslims in China that the co-owner of @warriors said he does not give a damn about, aloud in an interview.
