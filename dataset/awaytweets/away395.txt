Lebron is 37, Steph is 33 and he plays for a Warriors team that can still go on to win 3 more championships, unlike Lebrons Lakers

Soooo much respect for coach Kerr@Tristan21r @warriors No disrespect to Allen, I know he had much more to his game than just shots and also he became a regular shooter at later stages of his career but look those numbers that record been up for years and Steph is about to takw it much much futher, out of reach for anyone else@stephenasmith He has surpassed @KingJames. @StephenCurry30 never had to leave the @warriors to win a title like the queen or king did. He can win with whoever is on the team because he makes them better. 
Plus, as the all American family it’s Steph hands down.The @sixers vs @warriors tomorrow can’t wait!! Live games are always amazing@ndumohg @warriors Not really just look at volume of shots. Saying this is wild is disrespectful to Allen, although Curry is definitely better 3pt shooter.@GoIdenState @warriors @xo_tyraaaaaaa Lmao dont they have the Pacers before MSG. Curry gonna hit 10 threes in 2 games anyway. Plus it would be boring if he only needed 1 or 2. Imagine sitting on his ninth three and the anticipation until the next one drops.@warriors Its either vs his bro or in indiana@warriors The almost 60yr old me is a purist and admires the way Curry does not cheat the game and how he respects everything that happened before his time so that he could be where he is today.
