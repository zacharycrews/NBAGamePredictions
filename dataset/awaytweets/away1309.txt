I think Tyler Herro is better off the ball  than a true pg and a backup (6th man).

Meanwhile, the Heat are shipping up to Boston with hopes of stealing a game back and taking a lead themselves. Only one team can succeed, who will it be!?

(📸 @adbphotoinc) https://t.co/JUgmKkhqjh@EReidMiamiHeat Saw your post game words about Bam and Tyler needing to step up and help Jimmy . Agreed. But I find it hard to believe that Bam is going to be able to get going if the @MiamiHEAT don’t get him involved more often . (Continued in next tweet of thread)🏀 The Prop Master @BumpSports provides prop analysis ahead of Game 3 between the Celtics and Heat tipping off from the TD Garden in Boston at 8:30 PM ET. Boston blew out Miami in Game 2 127-102 in which Jayson Tatum led the Celtics in points with 27.

Lebron averaged 6.2 assists per game, his lowest since his 2011-12 Miami Heat season. Needed KCP for 3-pointers plus defense.It will be a “Sea of Green” tonight at TD Garden for Game 3 of the Eastern Conference Finals!

@Hizzay24@HeatMakeMeHappy @I_Man_12 @MiamiHEAT Well bam ain’t shooting &amp; not taking care of the mismatches. He hasn’t done anything on the offensive end at all, would you rather add Caleb who is good on defense but brick on offense or a sharp shooter. Duncan opens the lanes for the guys. He scored 28 points in the ATL series@Wick014 If you don’t think Lowry is that much of a difference maker, Miami has absolutely no shot in this series lol. You won’t even have to worry about the Heat going into Golden State without him because it isn’t gonna happen. Miami has no answer for three elite level 2-way playersWith the Heat shooting poorly against the Celtics, will Miami bring Duncan Robinson back into the fold? https://t.co/z76IObgCt3The Miami Heat play today. #HEATCulture@Obaptiste23 @I_Man_12 @MiamiHEAT Wtf is Duncan gonna do he ain’t done a damn thing all playoffsColin Cowherd explains why he doesn’t see the Miami Heat winning another game in their Eastern Conference Finals series vs. the Boston Celtics, despite the no. 1 seeded Heat having stormed off to a 1-0 lead before their blowout loss in Game 2. https://t.co/kERtI3My7E@YoungDynamo @MiamiHEAT Crazy!

The Heat should show maximum confidence in their superiority by playing their least capable players.

The more you force Celtics to dribble, the more difficult it is for us to set up our 1/2 offense.
Miami is guard heavy, so it makes sense to press.
