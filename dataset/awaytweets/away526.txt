Rodney is joining his brother’s staff. 

The Portland Trail Blazers are adding to their coaching staff, and it’s a familiar face for head coach Chauncey Billups. 

The… https://t.co/4IH5VDWgjP #RipCity https://t.co/xYws9n5oV8@trailblazers Very interesting@thezachattack_2 @DWaibs @trailblazers @wojespn He literally did worse every single year, his own alma mater let him go

The longer he’s here, and the more I listen to his interviews, the more grateful I am that he’s in Portland to lead our team. The guy just gets it.

Nepotism isn't always evil! He is probably actually qualified! But it IS nepotism and it IS a bad look@JoelSuspended @thezachattack_2 @DWaibs @trailblazers @wojespn That’s not really nepotism, Chauncey prolly just referred to the Blazers because he knew him and he was qualified.

Even if he IS qualified, and he probably is, most people aren't gonna take him seriously because of assumptions@CompDepths @noakurin @trailblazers Nah, y’all just take things too seriously.@RoCoXBlazersSZN @thezachattack_2 @DWaibs @trailblazers @wojespn It actually kind of is. It's why they changed the rules in the US Government.

And like I said, even if he IS qualified it's a bad look and it IS nepotism@thezachattack_2 @SethHolidayszn @trailblazers @wojespn He’s a good coach though@OnlyyBangers @trailblazers @wojespn Kinda disaapointed at this tweet, as it was once extremely difficult to become a black coach in this league.@OnlyyBangers @trailblazers @wojespn blevins still on the team?@trailblazers @wojespn ain’t this called “nepotism” 👀@trailblazers Is he related to Chauncey??@TJCarter48864 @thezachattack_2 @SethHolidayszn @trailblazers @wojespn people would be surprised how many of the coaches in the league are cousinsIs this a joke? It feels like a joke. Either that or an incredibly stupid move. Relatives working together is a really quick way to divide your staff. Way to mess up one last time in 2021, @trailblazers. 🙄
