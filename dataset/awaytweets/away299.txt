Remember Wiggs is a MAX contract &amp; Ariza a backup. Pts W19&gt;A10 Mins W35 &gt;A29, FG% W44.8&gt;A42.8, 3pt% A35.2&gt;W34.3, FTs Tied, Assists W2.3&gt;A2.1! Max contract? Nope‼️@HoopSpaces @warriors @LAClippers Clippers like the 16th priority in regards to Staples Center tenants

I wonder if the NBAPA gives program benefits to former players though, and if that overall has been going up because of TS ..or not? 🧐 @Fox_Ro10 @TroyCaylak @moldypeachTS @TopShotSadBoys @AwPtical__@JordanN1333272 @ColinCowherd @Suns @warriors LMAOOOO. Thank you for this 😂Golden State Warriors on pace for a 74-8 season 👀 chef Curry is different https://t.co/2QLCXVqA9uToday at practice, when asked about Golden State Warriors guard Stephen Curry, the LA Clippers' Terance Mann said he "can't see anybody (that's) more of a lethal weapon" than the two-time MVP. Extremely high praise from a peer. Clippers and Warriors play tomorrow.Check out this listing I just added to my #Poshmark closet: NWOT camo golden state warriors hat. https://t.co/LUSlCFQ7Hp #shopmycloset @poshmarkapp@BigM33sh @nbatopshot @BaronDavis @DwyaneWade @NBA @warriors TS: New8generd

@stupendous @TopShotDadMoves @Lukkabeast11Lookin like a healthy Golden State Warriors roster https://t.co/Pixa4NRHoy@TrolledByPG @warriors Ratio@ValleysProdigy @warriors I'm looking foward for that game cuz I love both teams. Love Stephen, but I do like CP3 and Booker as well). Along with Jazz, my fav teams. I hope they are all in their opi level and gives us a good show. I dont care who looses or who wins.This might be why we rarely see @NickFriedell these days (and huge props @CoachFizdale  for calling this the same way I saw it when @warriors first traded for @22wiggins) since he was so insanely off here. I never understood criticizing his defense either. https://t.co/L0j2UubNke@curry_lefthand @ImHulyo @warriors And the current leader of the mvp race is on the warriorsThe Golden State Warriors are currently on pace for a 74-8 win record 😱 https://t.co/CJztkLJNBZ@warriors I'm from Spain so I've never been close to a nba stadium.

Maybe we take this year off as a bridge to shed more age and develop the youth? #Isles@warriors I’ll just like to say one thing Clay Thompson you don’t nothing to hang your head for you’re going to play again and win another championship you’re also going@to be a hall of famer we Love you in dubs nation God bless you and keep your head UP #11 https://t.co/1TzxdPMsjE@BigM33sh @nbatopshot @BaronDavis @DwyaneWade @NBA @warriors @skunkystuff_de @marosticale @VamosErik88

 #GoldenStateWarriors@moseguera24 @VQHR07 @ComplexSports Seeing as how the Warriors are 17-2 with two major players still injured and the Lakers are under .500, I'd say there isn't a snowball's chance in hell we'll see Lebron doing the Same Cassell dance against Golden State.It’s fun when every opponent turns into the Golden State Warriors https://t.co/af3GCYHwbr@BigM33sh @cuteDAIE @nbatopshot @BaronDavis @DwyaneWade @NBA @warriors @kaseylandau @SpaceCityCards ts nadeauk keep up the good fight!I spent too much time commenting on basketball tweets using my professional account.

Thank you @NBA@JordanN1333272 @ColinCowherd @Suns @warriors How is there 2 min worth of shit not even 2 months into the szn 😭😭💀@warriors @Verizon Waiting for that Suns vs Warriors game! Gotta put an end to Cp3’s little win streak.

 “Kick me off the court again boy” 😂The @Suns won't loose...they won 15 in a row and are just one game behind the @warriors, The best part is that the two are meeting twice next week,the two games should be excellent match upsStarted the game strong.
Finished the game strong.

@Verizon || Game Rewind https://t.co/lDNq6vtA93@warriors @StephenCurry30 MonstroCalling it! It will be Lakers and golden state in the 1st round this year’s playoffs #bankonit @Lakers @warriorsLove how @juanonjuan10 is always so humble and grateful about being part of the @warriors and getting to play with his heroes. The Oakland native did not have any an easy road to @ChaseCenter; wonderful to see all the hard work paying off. #DubNation https://t.co/SB92TDbFRm@alexburtonjour1 @jtmvp0 “we” but wore a golden state warriors jersey 👎@msericalynnok That’s an honest answer, as I understand why you wouldn’t be happy about it lol. Honestly, how we matchup against Golden State will let me know what level we are at, because they’re back to being the Warriors of old 😳 PG should play well against them though!
