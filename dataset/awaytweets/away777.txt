#Raptors pre-game gets going at 7 pm with @Eric__Smith &amp; @Paul__Jones on the call at 7:30 pm. @william_lou has Raptors Reaction right after the game!

#WeTheNorth https://t.co/XksmZujpafI actually don't think that Chicago Bulls are going to get LeBron James. If I was an owner, I wouldn't care what your politics are. I don't think all owners are like that. I don't think Reinsdorf is going to get Tony Lou Rosa and LeBron James.It's really quite amazing how the Bulls have seized the mantle of the most competent organization in Chicago sports simply because Michael convinced Jerry to let John fire himself.

The bar, it is low.
