 https://t.co/kLGVL1dEwIThe talk about the @BrooklynNets being healthy to win. The @chicagobulls been injured all year and still represent the east as the top seed.

#WeTheNorth https://t.co/XksmZujpafI actually don't think that Chicago Bulls are going to get LeBron James. If I was an owner, I wouldn't care what your politics are. I don't think all owners are like that. I don't think Reinsdorf is going to get Tony Lou Rosa and LeBron James.It's really quite amazing how the Bulls have seized the mantle of the most competent organization in Chicago sports simply because Michael convinced Jerry to let John fire himself.

The bar, it is low.

#InAKMEWeTrust@Mhshoaff @AyoDos_11 @IlliniMBB @chicagobulls @KendallG13 @Stacey21King So happy and jealous for you guys!!!!I agree with @JakeLFischer who says: "From the ppl I’ve talked to in Chicago, it’s been made very clear to me that they are not going to consider moving Pat Williams unless it’s for THE piece, not a piece but THE piece that they think will push them to that championship." #Bulls https://t.co/GCQFzKNbMo@Sportsnet @michaelgrange @DeMar_DeRozan @chicagobulls @Raptors Without trading DeMar we wouldn't be champions in 2019 yes Kawhi left but hey it's all about championships so be it 👌💯👍🏆🇨🇦🚨🚨JUST RAN THE METRICS🚨🚨

@chicagobulls #CHIvsTOR@BullsSource NBA media needs to get off the idea that free agents go to big vs small markets. Instead (with maybe the exception of NYC) it's warm vs cold climates. It's why Miami &amp; Phoenix always outperform Chicago in free agency. &amp; it's why the team the Bulls have built is thru trade.Thursday NBA🏀

Need to see footage of it can’t find@FutureNBA0wner @taurusg47 @ZachLaVine @chicagobulls @celtics Yea but soon as playoffs start they just drop like flys. Think Tatum n Brown need to part ways. Get a pass 1st pg and center that has more weight than a broom.@bombadyl_LoL @NolanRamon3 @MrOverUnder @chicagobulls @NBCSChicago @670TheScore you need in person verification shit is stupid i’m in chicago and the closest place is 5 hours away@BDad617 @taurusg47 @ZachLaVine @chicagobulls @celtics one of my fav teams to watch. i keep taking Ls on yall because i keep telling ppl yall gon get to the conference finals and yall dont lol. the team is fun to watch, but very painful with the underperforming. they've been on a roll these past few weeks though@taurusg47 @BDad617 @ZachLaVine @chicagobulls i never considered anyone outside the lakers as finals contenders because i dont think no team in the west would beat a healthy lebron and ad.@Bulls_Peck @BN_Bulls @chicagobulls @DeMar_DeRozan I'm proud of you@FutureNBA0wner @taurusg47 @ZachLaVine @chicagobulls Bro im a @celtics fan and my dudes cant even break 500 barely. So i know this pain@taurusg47 @BDad617 @ZachLaVine @chicagobulls no because i did not think they would ever beat a healthy lakers team and i did not expect the lakers to not be healthy because they were healthy for the previous playoffs. 

if ad was healthy, the suns would have went home in the first roundFinal four showdown tonight at 7pm at Corliss gym for our ladies. #WinTheDay 🔴⚫️🔴⚫️🔴⚫️ @ Chicago Bulls College Prep https://t.co/C4NyTvu7XX@FutureNBA0wner @BDad617 @ZachLaVine @chicagobulls Im talking about last season. Prior to that finals run did you truly consider the suns as finals contenders?@BDad617 @taurusg47 @ZachLaVine @chicagobulls lmao yeah they def are until futher notice@FutureNBA0wner @BDad617 @ZachLaVine @chicagobulls So prior to the suns beating the lakers did you consider them as finals contenders honestly?@taurusg47 @BDad617 @ZachLaVine @chicagobulls bruh im a bulls fan lmao i watch every game. i just cant wait til all this plays out so yall can see as well lol. bulls are not making the conference finals as long as the east teams are healthy@FutureNBA0wner @taurusg47 @ZachLaVine @chicagobulls Lol Clippers are a pretend team@taurusg47 @BDad617 @ZachLaVine @chicagobulls no i wasnt saying that at all. and again, context is key. the suns beat a lakers team with ad, a denver team without murray and a kawhi team without the clippers.RSVPs who attends the zoom class, will have a chance to win free tickets to a Chicago Bulls game + more!@FutureNBA0wner @taurusg47 @ZachLaVine @chicagobulls Yea its tough im not even a bulls fan but can see their struggles specially seem like Zach dont stay motivated and is just a waste for atleast 2 qtrs each game. Hopefully they  figure it out....@chicagobulls @DeMar_DeRozan Tonight is a possible 1st round Playoffs Preview. Get locked in offensively &amp; defensively Bulls. Play Hard, Play Smart, Stay Focused. Don't take your foot off the gas no matter how big the lead is. 48 minutes of intensity. Get the W. LET'S GO BULLS!!!!! #BullsNation https://t.co/LK5Erih98A@FutureNBA0wner @BDad617 @ZachLaVine @chicagobulls Im pretty sure you were saying the same thing about the Suns and how they don’t have enough superstars last season to be title contenders. We will see how it plays outI’m convinced there’s a seasoned, NBA Veteran PG inside @AyoDos_11. The @chicagobulls are better in large part, due to his play and relationships he’s built on the team..@Jandosan14 @chicagobulls @DeMar_DeRozan he's from compton@FutureNBA0wner @BDad617 @ZachLaVine @chicagobulls Everything you are saying is very debatable but time will tell.

https://t.co/6TWIzSwmhU@TodayInSports3 Whoa.  That's some BS.  Michael Jordan was a bull.  When I seen that jersey.  What about it was one reason he ran off.  The Court I mean.  Retire the jersey in Chicago where he played@chifanpatt2 Cubs, Bears, Bulls, Hawks in that order in emotional investment of my Chicago fandom

Plus the sexual assault scandal has really dampened my fandom for the Hawks latelyCongratulations to tommyporo (@TommyPoro) who moved up 10 spots to take #10 on the Chicago Bulls team leaderboard.

Give us a effing big@Mr_Wils0n Are you a Chicago Bulls fan now?@JimMcMahon @JimMcMahon I moved from Chicago, early 80s. Right after I left the Cubs went to the playoffs, the Bulls drafted Jordan, and my beloved Bears won the Super Bowl. I bet my neighbor who was a Fins fan you’d win us the Super Bowl and sure enough, he had to pony up. Please follow meChicago Bulls will finally be a destination for free agents this 2022 offseason.

Discounted free agents looking to play for a winner and in a major market this offseason will prefer coming to Chicago. Bulls can offer the MLE, BAE, Theis TPE along with minimum contracts.Thibs take notes.  Taylor Jenkins knows how to develop youth.  And they are for real.  We have the talent to have a team like the grizzlies but thibs is wasting it reliving the glory days of the 2011 Chicago Bulls.Chicago Bulls Ayo Dosunmu currently is the 7th best rookie taken in the 2021 NBA Draft according to the official NBA rookie ladder rankings. https://t.co/fQNjvIP9j4@chicagobulls trade for Omer Yurtseven I beg youLet’s see…
