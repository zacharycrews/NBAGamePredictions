- Tyler Herro was phenomenal and the reason why Miami’s offense got going.

- Pistons had no answers for Heat’s early 4th 2-3 zone.

- Miami’s late-game execution was bad again.

#books #romcom #fun #Miami #beach https://t.co/uwen022ZsYFor example, last night the Heat went 10/38 from 3 and had some deep cold stretches from 3, but what kept them ahead the whole game was that in between possessions of dry spells from 3, they got to the line- 29 FTA for the game. Miami should always be a model for winningI was researching some stats with the Heat and thought their FT rate was a key trend that other winning teams would share, and... not sure. The top 5 FTA per game in the NBA:

Houston (24 FTA/G)
Utah (22 FTA/G
Miami (21.7 FTA/G)
Sacramento (21.5 FTA/G)
Detroit (21.2 FTA/G)@AnthonyPettit @MiamiHEAT That's a bad habit that will come back to bite them if they don't correct it.The return of @JimmyButler to @TargetCenterMN.   Are @Timberwolves fans still sore at him?

Good W. Be prepared for tomorrow.@MiamiHEAT We like thatThe @MiamiHEAT played that last 2 minutes vs the @DetroitPistons like they were the Monstars who lost their powers.

Why isn’t Lowry’s two points (originally scored as three) not showing in the total score?FACT OF THE DAY

Tyler Herro , who comes off the bench for the Miami Heat this season, is averaging more points 

...than former MVP, scoring champ and Brooklyn Nets starter James Harden ! 🤯🤯🤯

Tyler is scoring 21.6 ppg on 46/40/88 shooting splits, way better than the Beard'… https://t.co/6e5cjFAvEl#MIAvsDET

All bark, and no bite lately. 

Team looks bad on both ends of the court.@MiamiHEAT @betwayusa Bro it’s the fricking pistons cmon@MiamiHEAT @betwayusa Playing down to the competition again SMFH@MiamiHEAT @betwayusa Still time to ratio. 🙃✌️ https://t.co/MZtSFsYwvx@MiamiHEAT @betwayusa This is getting pretty sad@MiamiHEAT @betwayusa RATIO@MiamiHEAT @betwayusa RATIOOOOOO@David123458765 @BigShivs @MiamiHEAT joke went over your head@MiamiHEAT @betwayusa Why James Harden should join the Miami Heat:

-30+ PPG, 7+ RPG and 12+ APG (when he's back in form)

-The playmaker when Lowry doesn't play

-The shooter when Lowry does play

Atleast 7 assists to Bam every game (Can make him a top 3 center)still time to turn it around https://t.co/MYRecJOTvowhy are we trailing the PISTONS????? @MiamiHEAT@NoahN2020 @MiamiHEAT Game ain’t over@mashtimsnoc @MiamiHEAT You can’t do that bro🗣PLAY SOME DEFENSE @MiamiHEAT 🙄🙄

LET'S GO!!😤Told Andy I appreciate all the moves he helped make this off-season 🔥🔥 @MiamiHEAT https://t.co/oGTnHExRcqMiami Heat hit 2 threes in a row. 49-51 &amp; all a sudden the score goes to 46-53.
Watching live and zero explanation on why https://t.co/BtK8mdxh0jThe Heat have played AWFUL on both ends of the court. Pistons are lighting it up from three an unusual amount. 

Miami is only down 7 and have shown they been a 2nd half team basically all season. Throw that first half away and just play your actual game 🙂Do better @MiamiHEATIs it too soon to talk about some trade deadline moves? There seems to be a puzzle piece missing @MiamiHEAT @5ReasonsSportsⓘ This user thinks the Miami heat are winning a ship. 

*this is not a true source at the moment@MiamiHEAT miserable fan base. Can’t even enjoy a nice play without complaining.Heat come out tired and soft in the second half we going to lose by double digits to the DETROIT PISTONS! #HeatCulture 

Come out and play MIAMI HEAT defense against these young boys!!Another night at LCA. Pistons lead the Miami Heat by 7 at halftime. https://t.co/0GQuZft4YSThe Pistons are out-rebounding the Heat 20-19 at the end of the 1st half.

This should be a game that Miami is dominating on the boards, and it’s a testament to the lack of hunger that the Heat have shown tonight. 
#HeatCulture@MiamiHEAT Fraudulent performance by the fraudulent and musty franchise.MIAMI HEAT NIKE BLACK ON COURT T-SHIRT
