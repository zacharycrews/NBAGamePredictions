Kareem won a total of 6 NBA championships. 1 with the Milwaukee Bucks in the year 1971, five with the Los Angeles Lakers in the years 1980, 1982, 1985, 1987, and 1988. He also has two championship wins as an assistant coach with the Lakers.@boogiecousins was a fan favorite, similar to Bobby. He also contributed SOLIDLY almost every single game, with a handful of double-doubles. In the second half of December and into January, he averaged double digits with ~7 rebounds.

What the fuck were the @Bucks thinking?@Bucks Already choked in the 2nd qtr wtfWe forget how to play basketball and lose focus too much in games. Jesus @Bucks@Bucks Lookin good so far.

Milwaukee Bucks 94-90 Chicago Bulls“Malik Monk is currently making me rethink that last trade request for RJ Barrett! So @Bucks maybe it should be Malik Monk or if possible we could just get both of these snipers from 3!” #BangBang #MalikMonk #Bucks https://t.co/i8r4axCm6fI really think having Greg Monroe on the roster for the rest of the season might benefit the @Bucks on both ends.

I still cannot wrap my brain around not keeping @boogiecousins.@Bucks Keep him after 10@Bucks The moose is looselWestbrook is a league MVP, a 9x All star and leads the NBA in most career triple doubles ever. He gives 100% effort every game. All of his teammates loved playing with him and he’s a very loyal player.

He’s always loved Milwaukee and still seems close with many of the guys on the roster.

Bucks will reunite with Bled and Tony Snell in Portland tonight. https://t.co/f2R3tTv1JZThe @Bucks highest scoring averages against #NBA75 opponents since 2018:
