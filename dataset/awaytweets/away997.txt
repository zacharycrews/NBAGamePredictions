That's such a dumb trade for Pelicans. They can get something much better somewhere else.@KnicksOnClutch you know they do that for engagement right? @nyknicks will always react to these things.@NBA_NewYork A trade like that wouldn’t make sense. Zion, love what he can be, but he’s been hurt since he came into the league, and he’s too heavy. If you are the Knicks you scoff at this entire conversation! 😆😆😆 SCOFF!@hhpthebook @nyknicks When I say I bleed orange and blue I really mean it lol@NBA_NewYork This is the stupidest shit I’ve ever heard in my life.

I'm not going to waste my time with you of all people, but have your own dumb opinions. Be a troll somewhere else plz@StateNYKPOD @NBA_NewYork It actually gives props to RJ. It says of course they would want the Knicks best asset and of course the Knicks wouldn’t give it. They wldnt not ask because they know the answer. They would force the Knicks to say no before they say no for them.They make a decent point that the Knicks don’t quite have enough non-RJ assets to make a typical star trade work, however the whole reason Zion would want to come is to play with RJ. If Zion were to be a Knick, it would be after he made it clear he intends to sign in New York. https://t.co/IspziCSLZyMemphis Grizzlies Predictions and Preview for 3/11/2022 hosts New York Knicks.

Asking for RJ ends trade talks.@eepdllc @NBA_NewYork You can’t trade Barrett. The point is for him to play with his boy Barrett.

James Dolan owns the New York Knicks and Rangers@hhpthebook @nyknicks Crazy to think that the only reason Starks made the Knicks is because he tried to dunk on Ewing in practice before the season started. Ewing spiked him into a chalk outline and he broke his foot. You can’t cut an injured player so they kept him. The rest is history.@pistoleropeter @hhpthebook @nyknicks I’m a Knicks fan from Indy, I was literally cursing out my mom when that shit happened 😂😂😂 prolly the best moment of my lifePeople would come to New York to play with RJ, IQ, Obi, Cam, Grimes, Deuce, Jericho, Mitch, a cast of hungry talented gritty young players.

No trades (specially picks).

Even if get swept, is getting emotions streak and getting strongNew York Knicks forward Cam Reddish will miss the rest of the season with a right shoulder separation.

That exact group was at the end of their run and I didn’t want it to end. It was such a clutch shot.

I'm guessing the Sixers this year might break that considering the volume of free-throw attempts they have now.@nyknicks can anyone tell me why every year the same things happens…. #knicks ruin their chances at the post season by losing important games all season….. n then they ruin their draft position by winning meaningless games at the end of the season.
