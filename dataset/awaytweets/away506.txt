Same goes for lots of stars! https://t.co/tmqsxdUPDC@nyknicks Let's GO NY knicksAs soon as the Knicks’ core decides to start playing good basketball, New York will be well above .500

#TheGamePlan@bishifuever @nyknicks Double standard GALORE. Embarrasses Kemba with 9 DNPs, because the numbers show we are "bad" when he's out there. I believe currently at LEAST our +/- is the worst w/ Randle, not even his usage or minutes has changed. He needs a mental health pair of games off to watch&amp;"learn"..@nyknicks W and @MadKing1981 W https://t.co/vhPlMLAnYB@nyknicks Randle is an overrated and low efficiency player, trade himSwitch Obi and Randles minutes for this game and the Knicks game win by 15+ guaranteed.
