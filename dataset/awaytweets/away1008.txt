continuing to show what the @SacramentoKings gave up on🔥 https://t.co/0OI437IdUP@NBAMemes Where is @SacramentoKings in this ?@Kryynt Being in Sacramento I really love them throwing shade at the kings for getting rid of Marvin Bagley. I’m happy for him. Sacramento make poor decisionsThough their market is small, their reach is mighty. The National Basketball Association’s (NBA) Sacramento Kings are at it again and will tip off a live auction for gear with a blockchain-based app.@NorthStarsFist @OrlandoMagic @PelicansNBA @SacramentoKings Until Jonas Valanciunas is missing his legs and arms they'll be on the list@raptorsposting @OrlandoMagic @PelicansNBA @SacramentoKings @sixers They're just fat fucks don't care about themActively rooting for your failure @OrlandoMagic @PelicansNBA @SacramentoKings https://t.co/cTHUypUhQ9 https://t.co/WTI5n47p2lCan't believe @adaniels33 reminded me of the Seattle-Sacramento playoff series where the favorite Kings just got battered all series long, and while watching my now favorite Pels. Real Heartaches there. 😆💔@SubSoulReapr @twinkie_hunter @BarryOnHere The teams Jordan played in the finals would get dogwalked by the 2021-2022 Sacramento Kings 😐@SacramentoKings Is there any way I could get a seat from Arco as a souvenir? My dad worked for Lukenbill and he took me to so many games as a kid and I would love to get one for him.@ColeyMick As a lifelong Sacramento Kings fan from Sacramento, I can assure you the second person of this take is completely true and it has nothing to do with Marvin Bagley. It has to do with him being associated with Sacramento at all when they easily could have drafted Luka Doncic.@BSWest5 @LLcoolRay14 You don't want to hear Stephen A's take on the 57 year old LeBron James Sacramento Kings ?@SpaceRunnersNFT @celtics @SacramentoKings Be Active, always help New member. Very Strong project it's.i love this project 💞In Case You Missed It: Sacramento Kings head coach Alvin Gentry joined The Nick Cattles Show yesterday to discuss Domantas Sabonis' suspension and all things Kings with @JasonRoss1140: https://t.co/XXEcL6nFxl
