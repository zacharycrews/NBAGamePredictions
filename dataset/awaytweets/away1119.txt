Utah Jazz +4 (hold to tip) 1.1u

Think we can catch a better line with the Gobert news. Jazz won the last 6 games they played without Gobert and might be what they need to get out of this 3 game skid. 

Take a stab at the ML if the number is right.

Should‚Äôve changed to Utah Mormons or something from the jumpI see there's a lot of sharp money on the Utah Jazz tonight but I simply can't bet this team right now without Bojan. The defense isn't good right now and Bojan is a huge loss for a team shooting a league leading 43.7% of their attempts from behind the arc.@brettniels @TravLCox @RyanQualtrics @DwyaneWade @utahjazz So if the child in question was a teammate of your daughters and not competing against her would you boycott the team or hope that your daughter wished the child off her team?At risk of losing the 2023 NBA All-Star Game, the Utah Legislature's veto override of an anti-trans school sports bill sent a chilling message.
