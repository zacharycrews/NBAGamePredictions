They are playing hard, and if you look at the identity right now it’s just scoring from 3. Playing hard is given with Thibbs.@NotNope__ @HoustonRockets Vouch@painsworth512 @HoustonRockets We’ve had horrible city jerseys so not positive about the designers now. I can foresee a horrible combo of past jerseys w/ a current font. There’s only a handful of teams who’ve had a good design since Nike took over, so it’s not just the Rockets.
