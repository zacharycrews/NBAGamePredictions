GOOD LUCK DUBNATION!!@Durrell2021 The Orlando Magic made the Finals in 95. The Heat the ECF in the late 90’s I think. Bad teams don’t make the playoffs.

When you think of all the years that this guy got paid NHL front office money It has to make one think of poor people out on the street. Not to mention what he did to the Orlando Magic. He's a bum who just happens to be a Harvard grad.Just for all you mid-2000 Orlando Magic fans (uuuhhhmmm, @bykevinclark), Jon Weisbrod was just canned by the #Canucks. I haven't been able to reach Tracy McGrady for comment. 🤣Former Lone Peak High/BYU star TJ Haws with 19 points, six assists and three rebounds today for the NBA G League's Lakeland Magic (Orlando's affiliate) https://t.co/57PAzQNfZa@UrinatingTree I'm surprised they actually did it...

I feel we should note that John Weisbrod got canned alongside Benning, if only for the sake of Orlando Magic fans...Watch: Orlando Magic Cole Anthony takes us with him on an NBA road trip in new “The Road Game” episode https://t.co/YH4kZWTzv4@DannyDa27021564 It’s in Penny’s DNA.
