#takenote https://t.co/MBG8YZraOQ@BrooklynNets Pls do not trade harden@PBAinsider I think the Nets should include Kyrie Irving to that deal. I mean, his talent is needed yes but his lack of consideration towards others especially in the issue of vaccine is completely unprofessional. Brooklyn will find someone who's less talented but much better in general.You’ll get Ben and Thybulle and you’ll LIKE IT @BrooklynNets https://t.co/8Wwd1bIJtp@bubblefraud @chuucle @BrooklynNets Suspended@BarnesCohen @BrooklynNets Simmons is a problematic guy. He has brain damaged.@BrooklynNets Need Sharpe to play some decent minutes@BrooklynNets Wow @KyrieIrving play lets watch@Home_Brodie @BrooklynNets Please leave we tired of the dribble the shit out the ball on offense then pass with 3 seconds left or if not the lame stepback 3 that he rarely makes nowadays.Watch a live broadcast in high quality without cutting

#BrooklynNets https://t.co/upFZa0KeS8Harden for ben straight (unless we talking picks and shake or furk) it’s happening now or in the summer you bitches choose when @BrooklynNets@BarnesCohen @BrooklynNets Down bad 😹😹It appears Brooklyn is asking for Seth Curry and Matisse Thybulle too. That’s tough.

Philly would really have to insist on Cam Thomas + assets to compensate for those valuable pieces.

Nets aren’t really operating on a position of strength since Harden can be a free agent.The Brooklyn Nets will trade James Harden &amp; Jevon Carter to the Philadelphia 76ers for Ben Simmons, Tyrese Maxey, &amp; Seth Curry and there's no other way to spin it. It's going to happen.@BillyReinhardt Either way you look at it every time the Brooklyn Nets build any sort of draft picks there's always a superstar that wants to come here for those draft picks and then leave within two seasons
 that pattern has been going on for the last 20 seasons@BrooklynNets L incoming + announce harden to PhillyBrooklyn Nets vs  Utah Jazz | NBA Basketball LIVE | 2/4/2022 https://t.co/dhkqfeLjdV via @YouTubeI see the Brooklyn Nets and James Harden going 0-6 after this game with the Utah Jazz.

I'm not gonna say the nets are done because if they get ben they could definitely win a title but KD Harden and Kyrie couldn't work for even a year? That's crazyBen Simmons is perfect for Brooklyn because he’s going to be in the big market which he probably wants, but he’ll only have to deal with the pressure from all 17 Nets fans.If the Brooklyn Nets decide to trade James Harden to the Philadelphia 76ers I want six first-round lottery picks because that's what we gave up to get him @NBA 
If not Philadelphia can keep their problem child in Ben Simmons https://t.co/vsrJgvMknpIn #NBA news, the @BrooklynNets have reportedly softened their stance on trading James Harden ahead of the trade deadline. @sixers are interested in renewing talks of a Ben Simmons deal.Nobody knows if this is true (time will tell), but it’s plausible. Nets fans can at least talk ourselves into believing this today.

Has Harden even been a Top-25 player this season? If this is the best/youngest version of him left, it could be a blessing in disguise for Brooklyn https://t.co/as9TUWuPA8@brooklynnets85 @BrooklynNets Ditto for Harris if he gets traded too… or is that just me 😬I have said this many times about @NBA players.....
They are the biggest cry babies and should renounce themselves as athletes. @JHarden13 has been headache from the time he showed up with the @BrooklynNets &amp; @BenSimmons25 "REFUSES" to take the court.

#NBA #NBAAllStar https://t.co/3JzYFSseFr@brooklynnets85 @BrooklynNets All gear. I just bought a $30 Harden T-Shirt. If Harden gets traded, I should be able to swap that.Jesus, @BrooklynNets please don't do this! We never got to see our trio out @KDTrey5, @JHarden13 and @KyrieIrving in savage mode! Save Harden, I beg you! We will win this season if everyone is healthy! PLEASE DO NOT CHANGE ANYONE OF THE TRIO! #NetsWorld #Nets #nba WE DO THIS! Yo!Allow Nets fans to swap their Harden jerseys @BrooklynNets@BrooklynNets please trade the real team cancer for someone who will play and try in the games, Ben Simmons. 25 year old multi time all star is the defensive stopper we NEED. Kyrie and him will be UNSTOPPABLE on the floor with all the games they play inNBA plays:

But I just don't think Maxey will/should need to be included in a deal, if Harden is unhappy and the Nets are worried he'll want to leave in the summer. I don't see Brooklyn having enough leverage to get Maxey. https://t.co/dAlHbAEOGg@RealCodyMallory And to achieve that success, @BrooklynNets has to part w the questionable coaching of Nash.Harden has played more minutes in 1 season for BKN last year than Kyrie has in 3 years, fyi

Trade that mf Kyrie!!!@mhc_76 Everything about the nets since the Brooklyn move has been forced and weird@ChrisKirschner Many may call me crazy, but originally the Nets were strongly against any trade of Harden and then the Hawks get healthy and go on this streak. Truthfully the only team that can stop Philly and Brooklyn are the Hawks. They were watching TNT last night 👀I am not sure if a Sixers-Nets trade will materialize but if Harden wants out of Brooklyn, Daryl Morey won't pay a bounty to acquire him. It's probably Simmons + Shake or Kork, and some draft capitalidey support this finished club eno dey pick, idey support brooklyn nets too eno dey pick ei😂Excited for a Sixers-Nets playoff series after this ttade in which Kyrie Irving doesn’t play in any of the games in Brooklyn and Ben Simmons doesn’t play in any of the games in PhillyI personally hate the Nets because when the FIRST got to Brooklyn back in 2012 or whatever they came in talking hot shit how “they’re the real NY team” &amp; “NY finally has a team to root for” when they haven’t done shit themselves… I’ll forever pray on their downfall fr https://t.co/l7yGxglrM8The Brooklyn nets won’t win a championship with Kevin durant.

And after getting Curry, the Nets send Harris out somewhere else for another piece.Dude wants out of Brooklyn , Ben out of Philly.. Easy decision I don’t understand anything the 76ers or the Nets do as a franchise. Throw part time Kyrie in. It’s funny the 2 best teams in East have players who don’t “feel like playing” Fans don’t matter / we just pay the check. https://t.co/laWs58ODgO@BrooklynNets @JHarden13 Please stick out the season. Wait for a fully healthy roster… change up the spacing and hire a new coach. I can’t see one of my favourite players leave my favourite team 🙏@The_PhifthQ Harden has likely told Brooklyn he doesn't plan to re-sign

so we have leverage

a generous offer would be Simmons, Thybulle, Green, and a first round pick. That gives the Nets flexibility and a guy on a 4 year extension, and the chance to re-sign Tisse with Bird rightsAccording to @ShamsCharania Brooklyn @Nets are open to trade discussions with the Philadelphia @sixers for a possible deal for Guard James Harden...

I think whether it's a definite positive for Brooklyn probably depends on wtf the plan is for Kyrie?Ben Simmons to the Brooklyn Nets is the best kind of situation for him to be in.@aydenfranco_ @greenbean3742 @BrooklynNets Hell no@BrooklynNets I heard Kyrie is back on the court plying road games !@JeremyDavisNY @BrooklynNets Wait what happened?@TheAverageJohn5 Brooklyn Nets, we hardly knew yaNo HARDEN...Is it mental or physical??

Ben Simmons would be able be himself in Brooklyn. https://t.co/FpehdvpYtM@coach_thomp @BrooklynNets Yeah u said u was harden fan now he with nets and changed his game yo words😭😭 now this cus Kyrie fucking up his 3 rd team😭I am over the @BrooklynNets.

Thanks @BrooklynNets  🙏YA KNOW HES NOT COMINT BACK, MIGHT AS WELL DEAL HIM @BrooklynNets@perrylander_ The Rockets own the Nets picks until 2027.

 I will say, the best case scenario is for Harden to walk in  this upcoming FA, but the trade Houston made with Brooklyn looks a lot better with Harden leaving the Nets this soon.The Brooklyn Nets FIRED Kenny Atkinson to appease Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving 

The Brooklyn Nets traded for James Harden to appease Kevin Durant.

Steve Nash is a HORRIBLE Head Coach 

James Harden QUIT on the Brooklyn Nets and will be traded shortly 

🤔@theBKbig3 Dark day for the Brooklyn Nets.@TrellHunch00 @BrooklynNets Nets still in 4. We don’t need him. You know how I felt about him 🤷🏽‍♂️So if Harden is traded once more is he gonna get the Russ treatment same narrative? 2 years 2 teams although Russ didn’t underperform until LA 
One can argue Harden has been a disappointment in Brooklyn 👀👀👀

#NetsWorldThe Harden leak means one of two things:

1. Brooklyn knows he's gone this summer.

2. The Nets want to fuck with a rival and keep them in a holding pattern until February 10@MrChuckD @sixers @BrooklynNets I’m praying 🙏 for @BenSimmons25  I hope he moves on soon. Great talent. 🏀⛹🏽‍♂️How likely is a trade between #BrooklynNets and #Philadelphia76ers involving The Beard? 

"....a possibility." says @ShamsCharania https://t.co/O9ry4eso7GThe sixers are in the driver seat with this one. They can literally offer with little as possible with Simmons and nets got no choice but to say yes. Harden a FA this season and he won’t be around for another winter in Brooklyn. https://t.co/bqnQFJsiBII follow @JHarden13. I wanted him to go to the @sixers when he was still with the @HoustonRockets. My thought process was he needs a really good big. I thought @AntDavis23 should’ve gone to HOU instead of the @Lakers. I just hope this drama with the @BrooklynNets end soon.@RooshWilliams overall i think it’s a positive. thinking that #13 was going to leave brooklyn for nothing is incredibly naive. better to have ben simmons (a limited star) alongside part-time kyrie and injury prone kd, surrounded by g-leaguers than #13. #13 going to philly means nets never winIf the Nets got Lil Baby to move to Brooklyn, James Harden would play a lot better....@BrooklynNets come to think about it harden for simmons and say we got Tobias Harris. I think that makes the nets really really good. People forget before ben simmons was a crybaby he was a really good defender. Sure he can’t make shots but he could get to the layup and all.Curry is off the table hoes @BrooklynNetsIf the @BrooklynNets big 3 is blown up year 2 without even reaching a finals it’s the biggest collapse in sports known to mankind.Free @KyrieIrving, he doesn’t need a vaccine down in Houston!! Let that man go already @BrooklynNets #Rockets https://t.co/ZUSjR7k8ghA vegan diva and a snake that couldn’t win a piece without the greatest 3 point shoota of all time, ya fucking punks @BrooklynNetsI want this so badly. Also cracking up thinking of a Sixers-Nets playoff series in which Kyrie has to miss all the games in Brooklyn and Simmons sits out all the games in Philly. https://t.co/c3t3utQjhX@BrooklynNets if we make this deal I’m not a fan nomore https://t.co/vJ1K72jyc3@NatanelWRLD Owning the future of the Brooklyn Nets through 2027 making me feel real happy right about now@Xavier_Shane Ben Simmons go to the nets and harden becomes Free agent then goes back to Brooklyn 😂😂😂 3 peat and kyrie gets vaccinated or leaguer changes vaccinated rulesAt this point.. do it. He appears to be done with the @BrooklynNets.

We’re far tougher on him here in Philly than nets writers would beBrooklyn fan and Sixers fan right now. 

Sixer and nets are reportedly are in talks for james harden.

😭😭😭😭😭 https://t.co/04oeQfJaVHIf Philly trade more than Ben Simmons to Nets then Brooklyn wins the trade..@RooshWilliams I think it could go either way. There’s a world where Simmons gets his stuff together and makes Brooklyn really solid, and then there’s a world where Simmons is the version of himself that we’ve seen in the past and the Nets fall apart.James Harden must want this and the Nets have no choice but to recover some of the assets they lost trading for him

Regardless, it’s a tough spot for Brooklyn. https://t.co/OrfUsL50LS@robinlundberg @NYK_NYR_NYJ Harden has no leverage I still think he’d stay in Brooklyn 
Rather then give up cash. You play it out this year and try to win a title and see how it goes. You don’t hand the east to the Sixers.

#NetsWorldAaannnnddddd like I said after harden was ruled out tonight... @BleacherReport says that trade talks between @BrooklynNets &amp; @sixers are heating up. https://t.co/EYZQXcByF5👀 RT @ShamsCharania: Sources: The Philadelphia 76ers are expected to pursue Brooklyn's James Harden ahead of NBA trade deadline Thursday – and the Nets are now open to discussing a deal.

Details on @TheAthletic: https://t.co/JWlRgpwHqKSources: The Los Angeles Lakers could also be a team are expected to pursue Brooklyn's James Harden ahead of NBA trade deadline Thursday – and the Nets are now open to discussing a deal. Russell Westbrook could be a key piece of the talks.

Details on @TheAthleticImagine you’re gonna regret trading Bum Simmons to the Nets. Dude’s gonna have to take a number on when to touch the ball like he’s waiting at the deli.

Glad he ended up in a small market of Brooklyn, NY so he can “make mistakes”WHY ARE WE DISCUSSING TRADING HARDEN FOR SIMMONS… I MEAN SERIOUSLY THIS IS BEN FUCKING SIMMONS WE’RE TALKING ABOUT @BrooklynNetsDamn, can’t wait for the Nets vs. Sixers ECF playoff series. Kyrie won’t play in Brooklyn and Ben Simmons won’t play in PhillyBen Simmons helps Brooklyn a lot lol. And harden certainly helps the sixers 

Would be a good swap imo. (Nets obviously getting other stuff too)IF the Brooklyn Nets were to trade James Harden to the Philadelphia 76ers… what package would you want the Nets to get back??@BrooklynNets GO FOR BRADLEY BEAL @KDTrey5Report: the Philadelphia 76ers will pursue James Harden at the trade deadline, and the Brooklyn Nets are reportedly open to offers per @ShamsCharania.

Seriously?  @BrooklynNets are you crazy?That Brooklyn Nets trio folded after a half a season 🤣🤣🤣🤣just so we’re clear, tyrese maxey is, has always been, and will continue to be off the table @BrooklynNetsWOW... SO Ben Simmons to the @BrooklynNets??? https://t.co/PXEo7u2TjcBrooklyn Nets are a shit showBrooklyn immediately is the title favorite after they get Simmons + stuff from Philly.

Smart of the Nets FO to realize:

• A long-term Harden marriage isn't smart
• Simmons is a better fit
• They actually have to play defense
• They can't risk a poor Harden S&amp;T returnNo Embiid no maxey take whatever else u want @BrooklynNetsNets only trade Harden if they have been told directly by Harden and his camp that he is not coming back next year. Pretty significant situation in Brooklyn.BREAKING: The #Sixers are expected to make a serious trade offer for James Harden before next Thursday #NBATradeDeadline 

The Brooklyn Nets are now open to discussing a deal. (Via @ShamsCharania) 

Morey won’t stop till he lands Harden again eh? https://t.co/UZF9B8UtqkDuncan Robinson for Harden would be pretty solid tho @BrooklynNets@BleacherReport @ShamsCharania Do KYRIE for SIMMONS @BrooklynNetsDa Brooklyn Nets’ (da fake team here in New Yawk) project widda Big 3 has been a colossal failure. https://t.co/Joo8ttoOISSimply put, Harden wants out and will be leaving after this season and the Nets would be FOOLISH to just let him walk. If I’m Brooklyn, I’d pull the trigger. But I also get why you won’t because you’re desperate to see if this could end in a chip, which it probably won’t. https://t.co/c6Kzm7QAHMben and seth you are brooklyn netsTo all the James Harden Defenders; he QUIT on the Houston Rockets, he QUIT on the Brooklyn Nets.

Follow him to the Philadelphia Sixers! 

I GUARANTEE the Sixers will implode in the Playoffs, hopefully it comes against my Brooklyn Nets!Brooklyn always made the most sense. Harden or Kyrie. Nets make away like bandits if it’s a package featured with Harden IMO. https://t.co/BKxPJSWDxi@Demydeee Yes please 🙏🏾 with KD &amp; Kryrie Brooklyn Nets will win it all obviously if Kyrie get the vaccine.If James Harden has played his last game as a member of the Brooklyn Nets, the Big Three of Harden, Kevin Durant, and Kyrie Irving will have only played 16 games across two seasons together.

Would go up there among the biggest “What Ifs” in NBA History. https://t.co/AFWEe9Y3ge@TheHoopCentral @ShamsCharania Time to BURY the Brooklyn nets 💀Wtf are y’all doing @BrooklynNets https://t.co/uv4M4ftUAR🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣

To be clear I'm mostly laughing at the Nets. But also Harden and Morey. And also Simmons. 

OK maybe I'm laughing at everything and everyone.

What's going on with Kyrie Irving is ridiculous.

Kevin Durant only signed with Brooklyn because of kyrie Irving.

Bron was phenomenal but Harden was terrific too and led his team to more wins. Nash benefited from D’Antoni’s system tremendously. He never averaged 10 assists until he got with Amar’e and Marion despite having Dirk all those yearsGood time to remind everyone. The Brooklyn Nets this season (per game):

With Joe Harris: 13/35 39% from three
Without Joe Harris: 10/30 33% from threeN633JB, Brooklyn Nets special livery, Airbus A320-232 operating as JetBlue B6189 landing KSAN runway 27 on 2 February 2022. #avgeek #planespotting https://t.co/TkY8jYTBJs
