Neither Hardaway or Bullock have the ability to do that, they are bad vets. Need to start great defenders who can relieve Luka of some playmaking duties. Why not develop Frank for the future and form chemistry?@dallasmavs @Chime @RealJasonKidd Frank has been playing well as starter. You should leave him as starter even when the others return. He's by far the best defensive guard on the team, look at how DLo, Jrue and Mitch couldn't score much on him. Bullock &amp; Hardaway should not play more than him.@dallasmavs No way he's an All Star, shouldn't even be playing as much as he does. Chuck artist that can't playmake or defend.@MavsPR @dallasmavs Yet we have players from the Lakers who literally got out of H&amp;S protocols after a day!
