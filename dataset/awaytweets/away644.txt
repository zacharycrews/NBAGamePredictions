Eagles fuck you and that’s on the set.@HermanKosta @warriors @22wiggins I hope so, but defense will be keyed on him with no Steph. Also, without Draymond and GP II he is the top defender. Hopefully, he, Poole, and Klay are on. With Otto, Belli, and JK contributing.@ayden_mcdowell @warriors He was literally 1 point away from 20 and cmon the man needs a break he has been the offensive back for 90% of their games.@warriors Bjelica is a good player he just needs to figure out the power of his shots in game...He usually gets the ball right to the middle but sometimes it’s too much power on the shot or to littleWe will get outplayed if we still plan on playing small ball basketball and not make shots @warriors against the Wolves tonight

He was the part of the last-three-peat @chicagobulls as player (3 rings) and he is @warriors coach (also won 3 rings).

The argument of Gobert over Wiggs is strong but these 2 points are horrible. First point: WRONG. It’s not 1980. 

2nd point: An elite perimeter defender 😂 😂 😂. Elite is top 10.

Can we acknowledge Wiggins is having a very nice season without the Rudy slander?@sp_3521 @NunyaMyGuy @cavfanaus @NCancellable @GiannisForThree @statmuse @warriors @WarriorsPR First - saying he is only superior “in the paint” is funny because that’s much more valuable defensively 

Second, Gobert is an elite perimeter defender. He just can’t guard the entire perimeter and the paint by himself - the Jazz have zero positive wing defenders@cyanshsharma007 @Curry2021mvpszn @warriors @Verizon Casuals box score watching@LukeMoynan @305SportsGuru @warriors @Money23Green Klay was awful in the 2015 finals when they won@Kiel1718 @StephenCurry30 @ApesOfFlovatar @BALLERZ_NFT @warriors @BoredApeYC @flow_blockchain @roham @ElDumboTS @flovatar NicePeople always bring up the whole would the 96-97 Chicago Bulls beat the 16-17 Golden State Warriors squad &amp; vice versa.
