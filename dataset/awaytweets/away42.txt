🔵Pistons under 100.5

Through two games vs the (projected) defensively inept Chicago Bulls, DET has scored 88 and 82 points. Tonight, they're already without Cade Cunningham and The Stimulus Check™ (Jerami Grant) is likely out as well.

So... who is scoring?@LocksChitown has made a pick for @Raptors vs. @chicagobulls

vs 
CHICAGO BULLS

ANBATV: https://t.co/EEbfcU9Bn1 https://t.co/0QwK5JssxiHonestly, one of the best parts of the Chicago Bulls starting 3-0 is, are is still room for improvement.

For example, Vucevic isn't going to shoot 35.4% from the field all season.

I expect Patrick Williams will get more involved. His 7.7 ppg will improve.Happy birthday to @JoshhTerry, 

Josh is my successor as Redeye Music Guy (#neverforget), an excellent music and culture writer, and an even better fantasy NBA GM!!!!

FUN FACT: The Chicago Bulls and Sky have NEVER lost when he and I watch games together.

Take some inspiration  worth watching!!Hot take: @AyoDos_11 should be the sixth man for @chicagobulls this yearAtleast my chicago bulls are good know@KOT4Q @ZO2_ is better tho. @chicagobulls #BullsNation https://t.co/W3usRgmPADI was watching the 'last dance' on netflix the other day and saw how Jordon took every loss as personal to never forget what championship meant to him. He came bqck stronger and bolder to crush and humiliate every opposition that @chicagobulls lost to.@CheerTheAnthem lol…if it wasn’t for Bulls title #5, 1997 would easily go down as the worst year in Chicago sports history. Cubs started 0-14, Bears 0-7, and these Hawks.  Your Sox did okay but also had the dubious White Flag Trade. Rough year overall.@ChicagoBears i need yall to fire everyone in the front office including Ted Phillips. It's time to do what the @chicagobulls and the @whitesox did bears. This is pathetic bears fans need to strike.Don’t worry @NHLBlackhawks the @chicagobulls will sellout the @UnitedCenter for you #BullsNation #SeeRed 👀🔴 🏀@Stacey21King @ctsbulls here’s a what if, say the @chicagobulls and the @nyknicks meet in the playoffs, how do you think the fans, in a playoff atmosphere, will treat D-Rose as not only an opposing player, BUT A NEW YORK KNICK!Not much to say after watching the Bears and Hawks get embarrassed. Chicago sports is in a bad place when the Bulls are the best team in town.Y’all really my only hope @chicagobullsBulls 3-0 🥰

They always cash in and back off.Where did all the Chicago bull fans come from??@CGross23 What a world it is that the Bulls have become Chicago’s only hope.chicago sports r awful. cubs tabked the season and sold off the entire core that got them the first championship in 100 years. hawks r 0-5-1, bulls r meh. only the white sox who like 75% of chicago doesn’t even like, are good@StanimalSZN @chicagobulls Stan revenge game tmrw😈😈@StanimalSZN @chicagobulls Omg grow upI don’t remember anytime in my life where the @chicagobulls were the best team I root for@TheOffKeyAnthem At least Chicago’s got the bulls?The Chicago bulls are 3-0 and 3-0 ATS 😍😍💰💰The bulls are looking good this year @chicagobulls #BullsNation #NBA75  happy to see zo damarr and Zach all high flyer ballin together gonna be a lot of highlights 😤mls

The Knicks haven't done squat since the 90s (that's if you're just talking basketball)MY @chicagobulls ARE A SUPERTEAM THIS YEAR I BEEN TRYNA TELL YALL😭🤞🏽❤️🤍🖤 TOP 5 FWM!! NEW VID UP ON THE CHANNEL YALL LINCOLN IN BIO 🕊 @ The Windy City https://t.co/IXRKxmQUin@BillSchulz @chicagobulls The Bears haven't done a whole lot since winning the Super Bowl back when the fossils in the La Brea tar pits were still animated. The Bulls had a legendary decade outside of 1994, 1995 and 1999. To be fair, MJ was an MiLB player in '94 and most of '95. '99? Time's unbeaten.@windycitybulls @chicagobulls You guys deserve a hug. The Windy City Bulls are awesomeThank Goodness for the @chicagosky, @chicagobulls, and @chicagoredstars .@KyleL00 @chicagobulls Their chemistry has been great right from the jump!@Real_JOF @arturasfanclub @chicagobulls What a dashing fellow he is@albonextdoor @TheElisaLady @chicagobulls U wanna bet@albonextdoor @TheElisaLady @chicagobulls Watch mf.

Those Jan 7.5 calls were had 2.6 on the ask just a few weeks ago.The biggest positive takeaway from today’s Bears game is that they play for the same city as the Chicago Bulls who are undefeated.@timmycarr @chicagobulls @NBA It’s so much fun! Even if you just watch the highlights and don’t admit it…Thank god for the Chicago Bulls.@AlanStonkson @Timberwolves @dallasmavs @BrooklynNets @chicagobulls @cavs @LAClippers @warriors Seems a new US deal pops every week. I think $SEAH passes $10.80 this week- $11/$11.25, if market cooperates. If I’m wrong... I will happily add closer to $10, now that volume is coming in.The bears suck

The Blackhawks have not been in the lead once this season

The Sox are too young
The Cubs suck. 

We are now a Chicago bulls city! 3-0! https://t.co/5tCHjhBGUv@depressed_bears @chicagobulls @NikolaVucevic I’m jealous, Vuch said to me in this clip when he played for Orlando “stay here I’ll be back in 15 mins” me and that other kid were told to leave by a security 5 mins later https://t.co/JHmeJEzg7h@dwcprodz @chicagobulls Because not only are they winning, they are fun as hell to watch. Love the defensive team effort and transition speed. Watching the Bears this year has been really, really painful.Sooooo….. how about them @chicagobulls eh?@chicagobulls @amuseTV_ want to see my Bulls beat his Warriors in the UC@NBA @ZO2_ @chicagobulls Kareem was NOT left handedAt least we have the @chicagobulls.....@bulls_nikki The Chicago bulls are 4-0 tomorrow nightThe Chicago Bulls are carrying Chicago@NHLBlackhawks Chicago bulls and......the rest of Chicago https://t.co/4Oit03WifHAt least the @chicagobulls representing Chicago the right way!@ChicagoBears Chicago bulls in Chicago sports https://t.co/ClHOh88u2hI think we’re gonna see the @chicagobulls make one more big move this year to position themselves as title contenders #ChicagoBullsNever thought with football hockey and basketball going on the @chicagobulls would be my main focus but here we are!!@YourRAGEz @statmuse @chicagobulls @ZachLaVine @ACFresh21 @ZO2_ Nope sadly it was the hornetsI have been very impressed with both of the Chicago Bulls AND New York Knicks.#NBATOPSHOTTHIS  YOUR @chicagobulls #BullsNation https://t.co/uvFRtmzzbnWe have newly added veterans for the Windy City and a superstar in the making for Charlotte, can either team win it all this season? 🧐 

Chicago Bulls: +6000
Charlotte Hornets: +18000 https://t.co/lGckkX62MsThe Brooklyn Nets are (1-2), the Los Angeles Lakers are (0-2) and the Chicago Bulls and Charlotte Hornets are (3-0). Superteams? LeBron once again has to drag another deeply flawed roster to the playoffs. Can he get 2 pure shooters?

You’re telling me I should pay attention to the Bulls? No way.@TheElisaLady @chicagobulls You’re getting your first loss tmmrw buddy@chicagobulls @ZachLaVine @2Xtremebounce Well, we need you guys tomorrow@MagicJohnson @Lakers As a ball boy for the Chicago bulls Ervin is right I’ve nver seen that before when Ervin Zeek and all those guys played that should nver happened again play basketball ball don’t fight wit your teammates fight to win ❤️❤️@LouCanellis @ImRafaelNunezJr @mcuban @fox32news @foxkickoff @ChicagoBears @packers @NFL @NFLonFOX @justnfields @FiftyDeuce @AaronRodgers12 @JimMiller_NFL @KRoseSharkey @BigAntHerron @Buccaneers @TomBrady @chicagobulls Nagy vs. Colliton. Who gets axed first? My guess Colliton after the 11th game.Well…at least the @chicagosky are the 2021 #WNBA Champions and the @chicagobulls have the best record in the #NBA75 right now. #SKYTown #BullsNation@LouCanellis @ImRafaelNunezJr @mcuban @fox32news @foxkickoff @ChicagoBears @packers @NFL @NFLonFOX @justnfields @FiftyDeuce @AaronRodgers12 @JimMiller_NFL @KRoseSharkey @BigAntHerron @Buccaneers @TomBrady @chicagobulls Why doesn't Nagy take 2 more TOs in the final drive? He took one? Why not work on the 2 minute offense? The guy is a mystery. A late TD could have mad et 38-10 and 6 points off my prediction.@chicagobulls @ZachLaVine This team might not be true champion contenders but idc they are SO FUN to watch and I needed this@UrinatingTree And the only solution fans are gonna jump to is "FiRe NaGy!"

At least we got the Chicago Bulls.
