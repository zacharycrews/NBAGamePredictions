Legendary wrestler Ric Flair famously said: “to be the man, you gotta beat the man,” and Giannis is still very much THE man in the Eastern Conference.#Celtics all-time home record vs. #Bucks is 72-41 (.637), including four consecutive wins in Boston.

Where the teams are on the graph, doesn't have to do with seeding. They could be on a different place and still play same team@Bucks @buckgiannis Today the best player in the league plays. That would be Giannis Antetokounmpo. I expect Giannis to have a huge game. The Celtics aren't gonna be able to deal with him. He is gonna set the tone in this series. https://t.co/blHOW4M2NHGM Bucks Fans!  Today is the day.  A new series.

2. Know where you are on the court and don’t go 0-6 in OT
3. Can only play the team in front of you. Also they beat the sixers.
4. CP3 played every game + Giannis was hurt

Do you expect #Boston to get past the #Bucks? https://t.co/Q7iM682EMt #NBAplayoffs #MILvsBOSStarting tomorrow, the Milwaukee Bucks and Boston Celtics will engage is what looks to be a fantastic 2nd round NBA Playoff series 

Can Boston limit Giannis like they did to KD? How will Milwaukee feel the loss of Middleton? Here’s the full preview
 
https://t.co/Bvh87SLghB@squaresense @Bucks I listen to a lot of the nba podcasts. I don’t think many of these guys have watched the bucks much.

Just listened to one where they said Giannis almost never gets called for charges, which seems to be the opposite of how he gets called.@TZ1245 @Kaineisback2 @CallMeDDog @stankycrossover @pd771 @Yobi_BB @kirkgoldsberry @Bucks @dallasmavs @MiamiHEAT @celtics @Suns @warriors @memgrizz @chicagobulls @nuggets And its not arguable that bucks run was both lucky and easy .

1. Heat with zero rest after finals run the year before 
2. The nets without kyrie (took 7 games and 1/2 shoe size to big for KD to win)
3. A bad lucky hawks team
4. A suns team with no CP3 or a hurt CP3 team

Without a superstar player but with great defense, undrafted studs &amp; led by Jimmy Butler who is a certified star! Bam 💥 is also my top 5 favorite players! Hopefully they beat philly in 5/6 games. Dont need a long series there.@celtics got the best chance to beat the @Bucks ‼️1u = Bucks series spread +1.5 (-138 FD)

This means the Bucks can't lose the series 4-2.  If Boston is up 3-2 going into game 6, I dont see Milwaukee losing at home. I lean Bucks to win series.
