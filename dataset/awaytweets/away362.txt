You also have unvaxxed NBA players from outside NYC allowed to play at MSG or Brooklyn. Definitely agree w/ the beef at the owners/the team- he would be allowed to play on the road if not for them.Our dilemma is that we hate change and love it at the same time; what we really want is for things to remain the same but get better.

He eats 7 pound cakes a day. and throws a temper tantrum everytime he doesn’t get fouled and shoots free throws.@ScoopB @KyrieIrving @BallySports Still waiting for KI’s research findings and interpretations, which he promised to deliver when he decided to abandon his Brooklyn Nets teammates. Is it possibly that like so many Anti-Vader’s, KI was misled by junk science and phony evidence?My brain says Jordan but my heart says KD @BrooklynNets @KDTrey5 https://t.co/DtQ5GSPNMC@DeMarWrld @packers @BrooklynNets Lol ok then@DeMarWrld @packers @BrooklynNets Just say you’re talking bout harden then 🙄@ChanelDanielle4 @packers @BrooklynNets and Griffin@ChanelDanielle4 @packers @BrooklynNets I’m talking about everyone Beside KD, Kyrie, Claxton, and Mills@DeMarWrld @packers @BrooklynNets He is the nets so therefore u hatin on him@ChanelDanielle4 @packers @BrooklynNets who hatin on KD 💀A tight game from the jump.
