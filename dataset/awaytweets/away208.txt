Dudes acting like the lakers shouldn't have paid him cause they don't need his offense. Well of fucking course they don't. They needed his defense and high IQ. People acting like Caruso was a top 5 scoring option for the lakers@Ayaan3423 @DimeloWilton @statmuse @DeMar_DeRozan @chicagobulls The Spurs haven‚Äôt had to do a rebuild in 40 yrs and Pop is going to do it at 72? Pop‚Äôs rotations and coaching strategies have always been suspect but those Hall of Famers made it work. Now without that veterans talent SA stuck like Chuck.Chicago Bulls beat the Clippers &amp; the Dallas Cowboys won yesterday too.

Demar and lavine are #1 and #2 scorers, and lonzo is probably #3 while vuc is out. Caruso's job is to help set up defense and clamp up their best guard.

He controlled the ball with his right hand by pushing the ball to the floor. He then picked it up with both hands and dribbles again. This is a double dribble.  IMO.Crime in Chicago drops during Chicago Bulls NBA games https://t.co/8xMUMLS2La@FYAPhoenix @chicagobulls Howard had been through the wringer.

I got Chicago with the dub!@statmuse @chicagobulls @ZachLaVine @ZO2_ @DeMar_DeRozan Hey you remember throwing all this shade a few weeks ago? https://t.co/JbitJTvif5@n2thenate @m_land15 @chicagobulls @DeMar_DeRozan I know a few people from my area who like pretty much all the same teamsThe Chicago Bulls are fun again. 

That‚Äôs something I waited a while to say.@ExCossack @ZaktheMonster I mean, White is 21 years old and a former #7 overall pick. He's averaged 14 points a game in his career. I don't think Chicago is just going to bail on him. I like Caruso + what he brings but Bulls need both guys to give them something off the bench, it's their biggest weaknessThose of you who want the city edition #Bulls jerseys, they‚Äôre sold out in Chicago area stores. 

I suggest buying them off of DHGate for much much lower price. Yes, they‚Äôre fake but they look authentic and real for my liking. 

Just ordered LaVine for $30! #BullsNationDid @Stacey21King just say:
‚ÄúThe Warriors have had most of their Home games at Home?‚Äù

Well where else are they gonna have their home games?

Bam is like a lesser version of ad but he can get to that lvl@chip9197496 @EyeSeeRed2 @shlokpat6 @statmuse @DeMar_DeRozan @chicagobulls Nah bulls are good I just don‚Äôt think they‚Äôre top 3 in east. Top 5 for sure@brraaanndon @shamon_x @shlokpat6 @statmuse @DeMar_DeRozan @chicagobulls Well maybe he will be a all star but he competing with guards and not centers.

Bulls (8-4) The Chicago Bulls have continued to be one of the top teams in the NBA this year. They are not 8-4 on the season, fighting for one of the top spots in the East.
