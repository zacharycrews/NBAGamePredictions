Brooklyn is 13-3 on the road and are adding Kyrie Irving back into the mix — his first game since Game 4 of the Eastern Conference semifinal series against Bucks.Kyrie Andrew Irving plays basketball tonight for the Brooklyn Nets. 😈I just played the Brooklyn Nets instant win game.

More importantly how they perform going forward with such a good player only playing half the games. Can't think of another instance of this happening. Closest thing is the starting pitcher in baseball.......Spent the morning listening to stories about superstar athletes being jackasses (Kyrie Irving, Novak Djokovic…)

Also, loved @PabloTorre’s analogy of the #BrooklynNets here. 😂 https://t.co/1J2jdFYxarThe CDC now suggests that the @BrooklynNets Nets allowing #KyrieIrving to play could be strong evidence that the genetic component of the virus which enables it to spread isn’t spiked proteins at all, but rather…
