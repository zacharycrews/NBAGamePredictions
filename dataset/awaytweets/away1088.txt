@30reacts @ColbsPM @sunsbestteam @The_JackHanson @Jumpshot8 @Suns I attended a game in Phoenix in which we beat you without Booker, and the sample size we are talking is 3 games so who gives a shit? That was months ago when the Celtics were dogshit and Steph was MVP.

And no, you’re not better, by virtually any metric. You know this.@Suns @mikal_bridges @SociosUSA He scored 19 points https://t.co/nCVnjHYXeQ@redriverboat2 The Matrix is a staple of Phoenix Suns basketball and is beloved by this city.@30reacts @sunsbestteam @The_JackHanson @Jumpshot8 @Suns By Giannis actually 😵‍💫 By Giannis…@devinbookair Yes because he will have done what no other Sun could do. 

Think about how Packers fans treat their championship heroes. They name streets &amp; community centers after them. Phoenix will do the same. 

Loop 101 will be renamed the “CP3” and Camelback Mountain will become “Mt. Book”Phoenix Suns vs. Minnesota T'Wolves! #NBAPicks
https://t.co/bsIrpkFeBP@30reacts @ColbsPM @sunsbestteam @The_JackHanson @Jumpshot8 @Suns Correct. Why does that matter in the discussion of this season? Sounds like you’ve already waved the white flag, and recognize that we’re the better team. Yikes. That blows. Better luck next season. Maybe you and your lakers fan friends can buy property in The Past, ur fav place.@Suns Aaron &gt; Elf pls@KnicksMSGN I keep saying it, Obi should be used like Phoenix suns Shawn Marion.@devinbookair Book bringing a chip to Phoenix puts him in elite status that only members of the 2001 Dbacks know. Seeing Gonzo in public and old ladies crying and thanking him for something that happened 20 years ago is wild.

Memphis kept a key piece in Dillon Brooks and Suns ended up with Kelly Oubre. Without Oubre there might have never been a Paul trade. Best failed trade ever?@Dakodas_Dad @Suns @Timberwolves Every video, every bad news for the .....
Brings so much joy and makes my face crack from such a huge smile.
Thank you guys@NeeNeeSr15 @Thugnotes2 @IsiahThomas @DevinBook @Suns @NBA Booker is the best shooting guard in the league this year dog.@30reacts @sunsbestteam @The_JackHanson @Jumpshot8 @Suns No I didn’t. What excuse? You said AD was injured in a series where the suns won, in an attempt to invalidate it, and I said it evens out bc of CP3, so the injury narrative is dumb. You really are not literate. Although, ignoring CP3 injuries is a warriors past time &lt;3@30reacts @thenameisjoeyy @sunsbestteam @The_JackHanson @Jumpshot8 @Suns Championships don’t measure success… you probably have been a warriors fan for the last 7 years only… the only years they’ve been relevant@Suns Could you guys follow me pleaseMassive matchup in the NBA’s Western Conference between the Minnesota Timberwolves and Phoenix Suns tonight.

The suns overcame injuries to CP3, the warriors in your examples didn’t.

You are losing with every single argument you’re making, you need to log off.@30reacts @thenameisjoeyy @sunsbestteam @The_JackHanson @Jumpshot8 @Suns Half a century? Try a decade!

@SociosUSA | #RallyTheValley@brenandpeyton @Suns There's a lil set up right outside the Dos Equis beer garden in the arena.@IsiahThomas @DevinBook @Suns @NBA Also, so many in the media pegged Book from the beginning whereas, as in Embiid's case, for example, he was hurt a lot early in career, the Sixers still haven't won a title w/him, and they begged Harden to come over to "fix" that.  That doesn't necessarily make him more valuable@thrillathechase @Suns Did you get the Mikal and point god patches at the pro shop?@IsiahThomas @DevinBook @Suns @NBA I think the process does suck.  It's a media only award and they talk about it all year trying to convince their fellow media members who it should be.  That kind of discourse is why this shouldn't be a media only award.@IsiahThomas @DevinBook @Suns @NBA Also, I'm no speaking for Book, but he may not be so much talking about himself THIS year, but a little about CP3 last year.@NeeNeeSr15 @IsiahThomas @DevinBook @Suns @NBA most valuable player, not best player.  maybe you think lebron and mj or whoever should get all of those awards they didn't get back in the day.  Seems like above average Philly and slightly above average Denver should be better if Embiid and Jokic were truly more valuable@NeeNeeSr15 @_KeepItONdaDL__ @IsiahThomas @DevinBook @Suns @NBA Yes. He is first team all-nba. Great offensive numbers, has turned into a well- above average defender (lowest defensive rating for a SG), lead his team to an amazing record even without CP3 and other injuries, best player on the best team. Sounds like first team all-nba!@NeeNeeSr15 @Thugnotes2 @IsiahThomas @DevinBook @Suns @NBA More so**, not rather than.@NeeNeeSr15 @Thugnotes2 @IsiahThomas @DevinBook @Suns @NBA No he wasn’t.

The Phoenix Suns are currently on a 5 game win streak, and the Timberwolves are coming off of a tough, 2-point loss against the Mavericks. #Suns #TumberWolves https://t.co/WqlMX5xjAEPhoenix Suns vs. Minnesota Timberwolves picks, predictions: Who wins NBA game Wednesday? https://t.co/UraZJcqXwh@NeeNeeSr15 @IsiahThomas @DevinBook @Suns @NBA I can’t answer that because I don’t know the bias in the voters.   If it is being voted in fairly without bias.  Yes he is first team all NBA.   Of course when humans vote bias is always part of the equation.My two NBA picks tonight

Kings ML +200
Suns ML -118

Does anyone know why the suns are only -118?? They’re far and away the best team in the league so the value is great imo 

#sportsbettingpicks #NBATwitter #PhoenixSuns #SacramentoProud #GamblingTwitter@NeeNeeSr15 @IsiahThomas @DevinBook @Suns @NBA Looking only at numbers for points, assists…etc., is an overly simplistic way of viewing a players value.

Booker (or Paul) could put up better individual numbers…guaranteed. But it likely wouldn’t translate to as many W’s. His value is that he’s great without being selfish.@mellkk @Suns That would work for my cats! 🧡💜🐈@Desert_Dad1 @IamEthanG @IsiahThomas @DevinBook @Suns @NBA The Suns won without Booker too. So your point? That team is loaded.

But answer this, does Booker make the All NBA 1st Team?  Yes or No. You know that answer. There shouldn't even be a hesitation sir. He ain't the mvp.@USAproudd @NeeNeeSr15 @rfpcrawford @IsiahThomas @DevinBook @Suns @NBA he definitely does watch the suns play. especially in game 6 where he torched his lakers for 473/23/16 – Kobe Bryant played his final game at and against (#87) the Phoenix #Suns, a 119-107 PHX win (PHX: 20-51; LAL: 15-56). Following the game, Kobe gave Devin Booker Kobe's name-brand shoes with the inscription "Be Legendary". Kobe: 17p/3r/2a. Booker: 28p/3r/7a. #ValleyProud https://t.co/bjIkFFjYCoAmong elite perimeter defenders, @Suns F Mikal Bridges fouls opponents at the lowest rate per 48 minutes (2.7). And sure, that seems simplistic.

But @matissa15 explains why it's part of a greater story; one that shows he's deserving of far more praise than he receives ⬇【Stock information】CHAMPION "PHOENIX SUNS 34 BARKLEY" BASKET TANK / PURPLE / https://t.co/KYm8hdjO0G@NeeNeeSr15 @IsiahThomas @DevinBook @Suns @NBA A “statistical standpoint” needs to include his wins/losses. He’s not out there playing selfish ball. He’s out there as a top defender at his position, and an offensive weapon who is looking to make the entire squad great around him - value/effectiveness measured in wins/losses.@_KeepItONdaDL__ @IsiahThomas @DevinBook @Suns @NBA I have been waiting for someone to unequivocally tell me that Booker will make the All NBA 1st Team. No one can. If you are the MVP, there is not one hesitation about making the 1st Team.Our guy! 

@mikal_bridges is one of the most consistent and charismatic individuals we know. 

He is a tremendous example of being BETTER &amp; DIFFERENT. 

Best of luck with the rest of the season &amp; into the playoffs!

Is Booker a 1st Team All NBA?  Yes or No. If he isn't, then hes not an MVP! Case Close.@DevinBook nailed it though in his reply to IT… MVP criteria changes. How is Ja in the talks but Book isn’t. @espn you’ve gotta do better. @Suns keep grinding and to hell with the 🤡 analysts who aren’t being better at their jobs!Both are small market teams so don’t try that angle. I guess having someone like @KendrickPerkins screaming about the 🐻 for months is what it takes. Maybe the @Suns need an insider at @espn.  @DevinBook was right about the disrespect he gets for not being in the MVP convoThe @Suns should really be feeling disrespected at this point.

StatMuse: Let’s highlight the one guy who isn’t on the Phoenix Suns!

*Turns off replies* https://t.co/pRSNNgnp5eSteph had to save us in the 4th, so what will we do without him? Grizzlies knows how to beat us, without Steph out there, we might get blown off. Then the #1 team in the West, the Phoenix Suns, which has been winning without their point guard, same thing can't be said to us..@anthonyVslater @KellanOlson Wait I thought Draymonts greatness (2 points and 7 rebounds) was supposed to put Warriors on top, catching the suns etc …. ? ESPN all said GS with Draymont better than Phoenix and Memphis… lol … the team is a combination of too old and too young with overrated role players..@Cryptoniteezy @solelybrbdoo @IsiahThomas @DevinBook @Suns @NBA Nah. I know plenty of ppl that have never heard his name.@Jumpshot8 @VIVNPAZ @Suns I don’t think it will be tough until the WCF. Dallas round 2 might get a game from you guys or Utah might. Phoenix is great. Now if my Lakers are the 8th seed we will hear “do they have a chance”🤣🤣. Saw it 2 times this morning. Undisputed would talk the Lakers not the Suns🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️@Steve_Irvin @CTrevorNelson @azcentral @Suns It's way more fun to just beat him

Memphis is going to take care of them round 2 and hopefully beat 50% Kyrie tomorrow night. Phoenix/Memphis and Milwaukee/ Brooklyn, Philadelphia or Miami depending upon the other side of the bracket. As a fan so disappointed Kyrie is 50% https://t.co/550o8uWMw2@CTrevorNelson @azcentral @Suns Get us @luka7doncic or @JoelEmbiid instead!I’ve experienced seeing a @Suns player lift the MVP trophy three times, all three seasons ended in huge disappointment.

2022-03-23 Phoenix Suns at Minnesota Timberwolves from 234.50 to 235.50
Over business... man

That would be an epic Finals for Suns first Championship 🏆The Phoenix Suns have clinched first seed in the pacific, and it's looking like they'll be first in the western conference.

lol@ItWasAKindness @EighthRule @IsiahThomas @DevinBook @Suns @NBA This is just a pathetic amount of insecurity.  This dude made a perfectly reasonable point and ur responded with ad hominem tryna say hes jealous.  

Booker isnt as good as the top MVP candidates, and thats ok.  No shame in that.  Still great player.  Stop being so insecure@warriors bringing the heat with 88pts against the 19-53 @OrlandoMagic. @Suns are gonna run thru the West.@Suns @DevinBook @mikal_bridges BooK!!!@gmtoshit @Suns This you https://t.co/aCVsqx1wET@Suns @CP3 @DevinBooker31 @NBATV is streaming 1993 Suns road to finals.

Moving onto the next hater.@EarlyJulius @LukeSwiatek @AndrewLeezus This is not a discussion about that. I am simply stating that Booker’s season is not really up to an MVP standard, not because he’s a Phoenix Suns player, but because there are more impactful seasons occurring by other players around the league.@Suns @DevinBook @fourpeaksbrew Preach book you da man@ShannonSharpe I love you, Unc but you got to get on this Phoenix Suns owner situation. This is bad, real bad@IsiahThomas @DevinBook @Suns @NBA Tell me about itNo @Suns basketball tonight? Tune in to @NBATV. They’re showing 1993 Suns playoffs games.

Good lord. I plainly stated multiple times he’s good and that I like him. Just in my opinion I dnt think he’s at superstar status and that’s because he’s on the Suns. Annnd I even said I like the Suns. I like a bunch of teams@KumingasBurner @GraceMaximus @NeeNeeSr15 @IsiahThomas @DevinBook @Suns @NBA @Money23Green I wasn't listing a top 5 MVP candidate list. I was just listing the first players that's popped into my head. They are all valuable to their teams winning. Same for KD, Embiid, CP3, Draymond etc.!!Devin Booker’s (Phoenix Suns) vs Nikola Jokic’s (Denver Nuggets) Thurs... https://t.co/sAfaxyDX7y via @YouTube@drdicks @IsiahThomas @RexChapman @DevinBook @Suns @NBA Legendary profile pic broCUZ HE PLAYS FOR THE SUNS, IF HE PLAYED FOR LA THEY WOULD BE OUT OF THE PLAY IN AND BOOK WOULD BE MVP. but he plays for Phoenix… it’s a sad narrative man. https://t.co/l6Sy2lQGW6Los Angeles Lakers' LeBron James needs to be traded to Phoenix Suns, Charles Oakley says https://t.co/mOaiSyu4WO@IsiahThomas @DevinBook @Suns @NBA So clearly even NBA legends do not get things right when talking basketball.

You see the difference, right?@KiernanDaley @Suns I want to see the look on his face when they dont win it all 😄@TheNBACentral @CelticsGRD 2000 miles away you’ll hv to meet and greet and then (ahem) beat the Phoenix suns.
