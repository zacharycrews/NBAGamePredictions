There is no difference. Neither have rings #flockup @PelicansNBAESPN Sources: Phoenix Suns All-Star G Devin Booker (strained hamstring) is expected to play vs. New Orleans in Game 6 tonight. Booker is expected to test the ligament in pregame warmups, and assuming all goes well, he’ll be back on the floor after missing the past three games.@chrislewisASU @Jumpshot8 @AndrewDBailey @Suns @ManGamesLostNBA Never said you made it up but the amount of offense missing on that Nuggets team was ridiculous! Two guys that could easily average 20 just not there. IMO there’s a difference in missing some games in a year vs the entire season@kendallwheelerr @brawadis @Suns They ain’t gonna win it all so enjoy while you can lucky series@escobarnick3511 I like Ayton (being a @Suns fan), but if he wants/demands a max deal, then the Bulls can have him.

So if Suns lose, no one here will care... and, there's a Game 7, there IS that. https://t.co/7sEIr2zzluThe #Suns allowed just 97 points to the #Pelicans in game 5 but that could mean a higher scoring game is coming tonight.  

Phoenix has gone OVER 11 straight games playing with rest after allowing less than 100 points last game.

But football is just on another stratosphere. You would never have a ex NFL/HOFer say that coaching doesn’t matter in football@Ben_Cary_ @NBAonTNT @SHAQ @NBA @dallasmavs @Suns @celtics Very hard to say. The managerial strategy off the court and in the locker room is essential. Substitutions, matchups, defensive coverages, offensive play calls, constructive criticism. All things and more that have to be addressed by the Head Coach.Game 6 today! LFG @Suns! #ValleyProud #PHX https://t.co/4jGXwL8vil@NBAonTNT @Suns @PelicansNBA @dallasmavs @utahjazz Suns &amp; Jazz.

Playoff time, lets get paid! #NBA #bettingexpert@benmaller  You didn’t mention the Phoenix Suns in your NBA chip rundown, even tho they were Vegas faves until Booker was hurt.
He’ll return for 2nd round if Suns beat Pels.
