Suns close this tough series out tonight with focus on CP3 having a dominate performance and bounce back from the previous game where they still dominated with his performance. https://t.co/ysUUGJ1O3V@PlayersTribune @DeandreAyton @Suns @StateFarm This man was in Pathfinders— never would’ve guessed. @seantellem@Suns @dallasmavs @AZSports @az_mejor 🗣I’m in thea!@Suns @PayPal I’ve taken my four little cousins to as many games as I can afford and I’ve watched every single suns game of the playoffs and as many I could during the season!!@Suns @PhoenixMercury We should not be honoring someone who disrespects another country's loss and embarrasses a USA5/12/22

Lost 2 straight in Dallas but 3rd time is a charm. The Suns now know to guard everyone else and let Luka have his way. Mavs also don’t have a presence down low to match Ayton. Look out for CP3 too. He’s due@LethuTheLegend They’d ball hard, trust. Not sure about dominance though. They’re still a tinge weak. Difference between them and Suns for instance is that Phoenix has 3 sure fire ballers outside of CP3. Memphis really only has Ja, from a consistency basis.@Suns @PayPal I went to my first ever game when they were playing at the “madhouse on McDowell”, cried when the lost in the finals in 1993, and have watched almost every game since then!@brawadis @Suns @PayPal Love that energy bro, been a super fan since the 1993 team!

Yeah, those players I’ve mentioned have played with terrible rosters (injuries,rebuilds) you’re acting as if Portland has this amazing team without Dame. They would be the worst team in the league without him.🚨Game 2🚨

Chris Paul Over 8.5 Assists
Devin Booker Over 27.5 Points
Luka Doncic Over 33.5 Points

The 76ers have shown to be the better team when Embiid plays… at home at least.

Additionally, I’m hoping that Phoenix is too smart to go to a game 7 against Luka.This article is about so much more than basketball.

Phoenix ends this today. I'm sorry Luka bringing the ball down court 1 on 1 jacking up threes and fadeaways will not beat the Sun's.

Monty should show them this.  They are going to need to play great defensively to get this game 6!So what the Phoenix Suns don’t talk about is how Luka made the playoffs first before D Booker whilst the latter was in the league 3 years prior to Luka getting drafted.

Booker? The guy who choked in the Finals? Nah, he himself didn’t punk anyone@RyB_311 I honestly don’t know. Steph has been utter trash this entire playoff run and they’ve still been squeaking out dubs. That probably won’t work against the suns.

Game 6 vs. Raps. This arrogant no effort version of the @warriors is hard to watch. @Suns will wipe them if they get by @memgrizzAt times. And their disrespect to the game of basketball even if that seems dramatic. I was rooting for them to win the chip this year. It’s not going to happen, against the @Suns. @warriors are simply too careless and relaxed and not hungry enough.
