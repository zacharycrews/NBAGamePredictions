Milwaukee is just missing to many key players. Bobby has been coming off the bench so I think he’ll have a hard time getting going tonight .
 I wouldn’t be surprised if they pull off the upset.

I don't think the Spurs are gonna beat it but they could come really close.@BeccaMVP Washington Wizards head coach doesn’t know what the Dallas Mavericks NBA Champion player and coach knows, so Wes Unseld Jr. had no earthly clue of how to use Spencer Dinwiddie.@kylekuzma @Ballislife It’s because we don’t take them serious just like we don’t take the Washington wizards serious https://t.co/h60GqPGGSzThe incredible play from Spencer Dinwiddie since being traded to Dallas continuously leads me back to one question:

What on earth was going on in that Washington Wizards locker room?Bradley Beal said the Washington Wizards need a big guard who can get in the paint, shoot, and score.

That sounds like Spencer Dinwiddie to me.@BleacherReport @NBCSWarriors Washington Wizards better set their trade priorities straight because Miami is definitely coming for Bradley Beal to replace Jimmy Butler cos Butler is a goner. Going at Udonis Haslem and Coach Spo is an attack on the Miami Heat institution. The trade bell just rung on himAs for Kevin Durant, he is expected to weigh his trade options but sources expect him to choose between the Detroit Pistons, Washington Wizards, Golden State Warriors, and Oklahoma City Thunder. The Lakers could get in the mix and the Heat could be in play as well.@PanhandleRillo @LakersNation Gabriel shot 1 for 2 at 3-pointers on March 03 and 11th against the Clippers and Washington Wizards. 😄😄😄 Also 3 for 3 on March 18th against the Toronto Raptors. https://t.co/N4BOYy6XYK@weisselbergers I live around the corner from a basketball player for the Washington Wizards.
