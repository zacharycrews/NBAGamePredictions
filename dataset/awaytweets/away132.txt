76ers and bulls game I’m just not comfortable betting. #NBATwitter@trvisXX @HoustonRockets @HoustonTexans @TexasTribune how can you let your festival be so unsafe and unsecure.. people went there to die literally. I blame Travis &amp; his team and Houston for being proud of this@SNFonNBC @dallascowboys @Braves What about the @HoustonRockets and @NJDevils ?@SNFonNBC @dallascowboys @Braves No because in 1995, the NJ Devils won the Stanley Cup and the Houston Rockets won the NBA Finals. That didn't happen this year so this prediction makes absolutely no sense. 

Gas prices were $1.67 in 1995. Maybe by this logic it will go back to that.The Houston Rockets Clint Capela had a slip and slide free throw contest.Houston Rockets: Kevin Porter Jr

I had to get at least one Porter Jr on here. I’m rooting really hard for KPJ. He’s comes from a hard background that’s too much to fit into this tweet. He’s got a ton of potential.
