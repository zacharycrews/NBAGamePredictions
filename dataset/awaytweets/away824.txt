mark my word🥷Grizzlies GM Zach Kleiman addressing the media and said the @memgrizz have a lot of belief in the roster that they have now. The goal hasn't changed. They are working to win a championship. He has a ton of belief in what this group can do this year.@emi_f1sher the past 5 years with CURRENT stars. This excludes teams that look very different now such as the raptors or the cavs.

I am focusing on teams that are rising stars. I will provide pros and cons.

The Memphis Grizzlies:

Pros: Young star Ja Morant is a walking highlight real.Dillon Brooks is doing well but is slightly behind in his injury recovery and will likely not be back until March

My initial comment was in response to the interview w/ Ja, fyi.Great night for Brandon Clarke scoring 18 points off the bench on 9/12 shooting with 7 rebounds, 4 assists and 3 blocks in a win over the Clippers @brandonclarke23 @memgrizz@Mthomas9123 @memgrizz @jarenjacksonjr @JaMorant Didn't say anyone carried anyone on their back. I said he (Ja) has his team's back. Meaning, he takes up for, encourages, promotes, coaches, and yes plays alongside them. But make no mistake, he is definitely a leader on this team.@NikkaTrue @NBA2K @memgrizz bro what team are u a fan of??@MemphisHustle @JaMorant @memgrizz Yo the 26th is my birthday lesgoooooooo@memgrizz @JaMorant coming straight https://t.co/9Ef6tjMQar@NBA2K @memgrizz The disrespect on DBook is real with 2k. https://t.co/yk8q2sBuRt😹Faabulous start @warriors 👏🏼👏🏿👏🏾👏🏻🏀🏀🏀Those are the dub vibes in effect!
