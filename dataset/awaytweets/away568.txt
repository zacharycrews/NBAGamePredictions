My TS username: StathisVog@NA30SC @AZSportsNut11 @warriors No he doesn’t. He won’t even have 30 games by the time of the all star game. He should be removed from the all star games if he actually makes it . Other players deserve more than he does . In fact the whole league deserves more than he does as of right now cuz he hasn’t played@victorrmtx @NotDGoody @statmuse @warriors @WarriorsPR What an idiot when guarded by Wiggins luka was 1/6 and 2 to he had that foul merchant on lockMeanwhile…LeBron plays against the “@warriors” and says nothing.

PG is fucking awesome, but he's not having a good year. 42% from the field and 32% from 3 is awful for him. His offensive rating (per 100 possessions) is 98.

I’d give him or draymond the nod if PG isnt back for the ASG tho🇺🇸 No Steph Curry and Draymond Green for the Warriors tonight at Pelicans. Curry has a quad issue, Green is dealing with a sore hip

#TheGamePlan@warriors Lets TALK to start to TRADE him NOW🤔@warriors 😪 sucks.@04hamsuke @warriors No way you are defending curry and he’s have his worst shooting year and struggles to get 15 points on 24 shots@CurryTrae @AndraLThomas1 @warriors I feel like he needs the ball in his hands he needs to be agressive to start of the game. I feel like him playing off ball is getting old, look at the games where he had the ball in his hand they were blowing out teams.@warriors Yeah...he got the REC🏀RD but this year is the WORST for STEPH CURRY🥺😥😭😭😭Golden State Warriors (All Ball) gracias lor seguirme!@warriors SIGN HIM https://t.co/gSNro7eZr8My favor teams played today and missed it 💔 gotta find that re run @warriors &amp; @dallasmavs 💙💚💙💛@tomwilsondagoat @warriors No your just wrong, a better argument you could have brought up was someone like harden or tear young getting more calls but no, you brought up lebron because you clearly have a hatred towards him, because you brought him up specifically.I cashed in on my biggest Christmas wish - I didn’t ask for any presents - just enough money to buy tickets to see @StephenCurry30 and the @warriors vs the @dallasmavs. 

I still hope to get a pair of Steph’s shoes!!

Your work ethic &amp; love of the game are tremendous and should be emulated by younger players. Stay well; all the best to you.@BraydenRobinet5 @warriors no way you actually created one acc just for it 😭😭😭@solomon_tech @warriors Yeah I hope too. Because when klay is back, for sure it will relieve some pressure from steph.@Cooper69267214 @warriors You Lebron fanboys get so defensive, curry is also averaging less free throws this year so idk what you’re looking at💀😂@warriors All Teams will be coming after us, So we need to be aggressive ready to play and be strong moving forward. It’s only going to get harder especially with other teams knows @KlayThompson coming back. We need to punch everyone hard at the start of every game @warriors @WarriorsPR@warriors Warriors are garbage@tomwilsondagoat @warriors it dosent matter your wrong regardless, they get the same amount of free throws. you have no argument here@mamba4evaeva @JayMill00758985 @warriors 2 bad games 1 bad seasons and you acting steph always play like this, come on bruhh.

Kuminga would be a nice get. Maybe the Pacers do that. Im never sure what GSW will do.@1011ap4 @kkdreamss @AdmireIIII @TrolledByPG @warriors Can’t compare this team to that of last seasons@kkdreamss @AdmireIIII @TrolledByPG @warriors Warriors have played better than the suns this season and have had a harder schedule this far@NbaGenius548 @kkdreamss @AdmireIIII @TrolledByPG @warriors Suns haven’t won shit, none of their players have won a championship.

Asking for a friend, we need the advice of a specialist.@john12680 @MikeGrabman @Jumpshot8 @JohnEhrenfeld @NBA @Suns @warriors @Bulls @nets @Bucks @memgrizz I think they could get Kuminga + a 1st from GSW if they really tried, that's probably worth two Grizz 1sts.   Sabonis has quite a bit of value they're waiting for a bidding war@mlc22_ @warriors true idk what happen he been in a slump for a couple weeks now but obuisly he gon have couple good games in a long slump but mostly playing bad gotta say it and im a big curry fan@warriors Funny how Warriors Instagram showed Curry clips from beginning of this game as if they’re going to cruise to an easy victory, then they only score 82...WTF@Jack_Cxpalot @warriors @NBCSAuthentic @espn @957thegame @betwayusa Yeah 😭Mavericks fans also celebrated a 99-82 victory Wednesday over the Golden State Warriors. https://t.co/Cekr2l9HWC@MikeGrabman @john12680 @Jumpshot8 @JohnEhrenfeld @NBA @Suns @warriors @Bulls @nets @Bucks @memgrizz Not sure who you're referring to here tbh but if you're talking about Ayton he'll drive you crazy, his motor has been one of the knocks against him ever since draft day, he floats around and looks like he's coasting quite a bit in most games@Jimmmmm30095835 @kkdreamss @AdmireIIII @TrolledByPG @warriors Y’all lost to them without Booker calm down@Viscous_cree @MikeGrabman @Jumpshot8 @JohnEhrenfeld @NBA @Suns @warriors @Bulls @nets @Bucks @memgrizz totally agree thats why slomo on an expiring makes more sense. They want a rebuild. They wont get 2 first rounders from anyone else (OKC is not trading for Turner)@john12680 @MikeGrabman @Jumpshot8 @JohnEhrenfeld @NBA @Suns @warriors @Bulls @nets @Bucks @memgrizz They're pretty sick of having both Sabonis &amp; Myles on the same team iirc, they want only one of them to remain so one of them alone can play the 5.   Trading for Adams creates the same problem for them all over again@yashgurango123 @flyers_fan2002 @warriors ok lol@SPO0KDAD @BleacherReport @ShamsCharania @warriors I don’t know why they released him he was ballin@john12680 @MikeGrabman @Jumpshot8 @JohnEhrenfeld @NBA @Suns @warriors @Bulls @nets @Bucks @memgrizz I do think he can be had but it probably has to be an overpay i.e. KAT or something similar, he can't really go anywhere as a restricted free agent and only like 2 teams have any cap space so it's kind of a bad time for him in terms of leverage.  Sarver is super cheap though yeah@MasalaMan06 @BleacherReport @ShamsCharania @warriors dude is still serviceableBring back Boogie @warriorsThe @warriors need a center and @boogiecousins is now available.

I think they would@MikeGrabman @john12680 @Jumpshot8 @JohnEhrenfeld @NBA @Suns @warriors @Bulls @nets @Bucks @memgrizz I remember browsing UNC fan reactions and they were ecstatic about Cam going to PHX which gave me hope, he hasn't disappointed in the slightestLuka Doncic scored 26 points and the Dallas Mavericks celebrated before a ceremony to retire Dirk Nowitzki's number by beating cold-shooting Stephen Curry and the Golden State Warriors 99-82 on Wednesday night. https://t.co/EESGDfEkEt@SportsCenter @swish41 Congrats on the W @mcuban.

Paul is expensive. Sarver is a cheap skate. You think Ayton is happy there after not getting extended? Maybe I am wrong. I think he can be had. But there is always someone  unhappy.

I think ayton is odd man out. He can be had. But that would be a good trade for Minny. But there are other options for Memphis. Sabonis/turner. Siakim (wouldn’t be my pick).

Idk if moving him for Steven Adams and some mid-tier draft picks makes alot of sense

Celtics, who knows.   They could use the depth so a 4-for-1 or 5-for-1 would help them@warriors Lol maybe bench curry for a bit hahaha@warriors should sign DeMarcus Cousins!@Nii_bwoy @warriors Yeah charley@warriors Hopefully we can pull something together tomorrow night.That would be the @Suns, not the @warriors. https://t.co/ThDQZCR1Ob@jichanrosmi @warriors You funny 😂@hapiNES65762311 @TrolledByPG @warriors Hater!!!

Horrible!!@JayMill00758985 @Klay_SZN @NadalCurryJaggi @warriors omg Jay, why are you telling me what happened last season is comparable to this season, this season the team is completely different.

I trust the warriors and their experience over the suns.@Zekite_ @Klay_SZN @NadalCurryJaggi @warriors What happens when curry got injured last season for 9 games went from a 5th seed to fighting for play in  what happen when he broke his hand they were worst team in the nba without curry warriors won’t even win 40 games sadly@solomon_tech @warriors Yeah, since the three point record is in his mind, his game is fucked up.@warriors pretty please https://t.co/ulC0IuuaWF@__caden__ @colby_burner @warriors Lost to the pacers unfortunatelyGPII found himself ahead of the pack and Steph found him 🤝

It's just one of those days I guess, let's pick up and move on to the next game.Luka Doncic scored 26 points and the Dallas Mavericks celebrated before a ceremony to retire Dirk Nowitzki’s number by beating cold-shooting Stephen Curry and the Golden State Warriors 99-82 on Wednesday night. https://t.co/tdJ0OWgrAF@JayMill00758985 @Klay_SZN @NadalCurryJaggi @warriors Have you been paying attention?? there is no way in hell you couldn't see Steph missing a huge amount of open 3s off screens and off-ball movement. Don't you hear how many times the announcers have said stuff like "wow, he doesn't miss many of those looks"@warriors let the critics and cheer the players on go Golden state warriors Stephen Curry you are the best this bad time will pass and have won again@warriors Hurry Klay come back to us!!!@warriors SIGN SIGN SIGN https://t.co/IjJvoJc1vR@Underdog__NBA @warriors go get em@04hamsuke @OnesmoSimon1 @warriors I credit the bad game to the nonsense official crew led by Mark Davis chumping out warriors on every contact play under the rim and more. Drey even was heard saying I know what you're doing in the 1st quarter but y'all pay attention.@Jeopardy @warriors This show feels so different now.  Im a 30+ year viewer and It just feels foreign to me.The ten players I would involve for the Golden State Warriors when the playoffs arrive: 

Curry, Thompson, Wiggins, Green, Looney, Poole, Payton II, Porter Jr, Iguodala, Wiseman. JTA also brings energy.

Bjelica and Lee have disappointed me / simply lack the required quality.@warriors I don’t care, as long as the three-pointer record always exists@warriors what the actual heckLuka Doncic scored 26 points and the Dallas Mavericks celebrated before a ceremony to retire Dirk Nowitzki’s number by beating cold-shooting Stephen Curry and the Golden State Warriors 99-82 on Wednesday night.

The Golden State Warriors should bring him off the bench. Andre Iguodala, Otto porter jr, Juan Toscanini Anderson, johnathan kuminga, and Andre Wiggins all play the same position small forward when klay comes back.@warriors you judge Curry on the 2 game because you don't like losing Curry is the best and he will always be the best we are in the regular season and the play offs are still very far away and our record is not bad go Golden state we are the best@GunnersW0RLD @warriors Must win game?

They got to focus on the chip though and the ' usual Steph' still the barometer to win it.@Jackson91475157 @realnillyy @TwoWayKlay @CFC_Isaiah @warriors 🗿nice ratio ya got thereI don’t know what’s wrong with Steph Curry like he’s taking a back seat in scoring giving some opportunities to his teammates, but that’s not what we Warriors fans want. We want you to be aggressive &amp; keep shootin those long bombs Steph! @RealSkipBayless @ShannonSharpe @warriors@warriors Losses happen even in the weirdest of ways but we have to keep the support up.
Don't know what's wrong with Curry recently but I hope he figures it out. I don't care if he wins the MVP, I just want him to do enough for us to win if it gets him the MVP fantastic.@warriors Appreciate the warriors for the love. You guys are champions too.@Dr_Dreidel_ @OnesmoSimon1 @warriors have you been seeing last posts on warriors games tho? it's all about:

we winning? then imma be a fan

we losing? time to trash talk the team im supposed to like.

maybe im from a different culture and am not used to it... idk 🤷🏻‍♂️@24IamTheGOAT8 @warriors Lakers still suck@marquel65 @VitalVegas They do. The Golden State Warriors.@mamba4evaeva @warriors You should know a lot of kobrick most must fg@warriors Steph not getting the MVP. Rightfully so@warriors This was basically a trash game the way the warriors literally through it to save face for Dirk…nothing will change my mind on this…they played half ass@warriors @StephenCurry30 
you are hot garbage. Unbelievable. https://t.co/zyHsD7TGTc@warriors Steph's real problem is his mentality...he's always thinking that all eyes on him even in an open shot, he needs a psychologist. Maybe rest for about a month, i don't want to watch replay when we lost especially steph's off nightssssssssss.@TrolledByPG @warriors Steph Curry is a great shooter/scorer but In terms of being a floor general and not making careless turn overs he’s awful at times@KoronaVyress @NBA @warriors @dallasmavs Lost by 17@hay0osiapa @Steph30Burner @warriors Bro I don't even think he is in a rhythm rn@warriors @StephenCurry30 bounce back!!!! 💪@probablyatypo @warriors i never said that it's not ok to make critics about the mistakes, just make 'em in a constructive way, when you see the comments here (and in the last games tbh) there's just no support at all, only ppl being harsh for no reason...Let's Go @Mavs! Great win tonight against the number one team in the NBA @warriors. On Dirk Jersey Retirement night no less. #MF4L #41Forever #DirkNowitzkiCongratulations for a great 21 years with @dallasmavs the whole @nba career, @swish41 #forever41! Even better, @dallasmavs beat @warriors during his jersey retirement night. https://t.co/J4cNtpPngT@colby_burner @warriors Barely over 0.5 sadly@warriors 💔💔💔💔Just don't get it why Steph is not being Steph any more since December @StephenCurry30Wow.

Golden State Warriors - Dallas Mavericks 
🛋 2.7/5 Sofis https://t.co/8ttYkPUW6t@warriors Curry selling makes me happy it’s time for him to retire nothing left for him to do@warriors This team is frustrating to watch.  They either play great or they all suck.   For a team to be in first place and rank almost last in free throw means they rely on outside shooting too much.  Just like tonight when shots don’t fall, they look lost.  Pathetic!@DDDGURU @warriors The GS Warriors have been scouted well the last 10 games, and yet they have been miraculously winning close games. Until Klay comes back, Kerr might consider using Steph more as a playmaker so the ball will already be in his hands because Porter, Poole, &amp; Wiggins can all score.GOING LIVE TO REACT TO THE DIRK CEREMONY AND THE BIG W OVER THE GOLDEN STATE WARRIORS!

https://t.co/CQ9OVgs1Ov@warriors That can't be number 30.

They outhustled us today@erjhassy @DDDGURU @warriors I think you’re right. 😬@Forgivegabex @mlc22_ @rTghost2 @warriors That’s basically what I said…
Before his slump he definitely was but this last month has taken him out the conversation@WutRWeEvenDoing @warriors Out of all the shit performances you decided to take offense to Draymond's??@WisemanFan @warriors Curry@DDDGURU @warriors That’s putting it nicely. Call it blasphemy, but I was starting to wonder if they were gonna stop doubling Curry until further notice. He just ain’t right lately. Hoping he pulls through it.@warriors Damn, as much as I want to talk trash about the @warriors &amp; @StephenCurry30 i can’t help but feel they folded on purpose in order to not mess up the Dirk ceremony. I’ve never seen a defense go as limp as they went in this gameTrash @warriors@nvmpq @warriors His gravity??? https://t.co/eTmSA8lULK@warriors 82 pts vs the garbage Mavs is unacceptable. They need to get their shit together and stop messing w these bum teams@warriors Big ups for the love from the Splash Brothers! Dray should replace Barkley as he tells it like it is.@warriors The sloppy ball handling, the sloppy passes &amp; the fouling continues to haunt the Warriors.  They are unable to fix the turnover problems &amp; the bad passes?  Relying only the 3 point is not working. Green must bring the ball &amp; not Curry. Curry has too many turnovers.@warriors Send curry to the g league to get his confidence up@warriors Thank god klay is coming back cant take this curry bullshit anymore 🤦🏻‍♂️@probablyatypo @warriors Undersized SG@warriors Please play Q more!@youyaslife @warriors Did he tweet that ?

People are allowed to be out of form, even if its steph.@04hamsuke @warriors i get you but there’s a difference between losing and beating yourself, and they beat themselves. steph cant hit the ocean and he keeps forcing shots, draymond refuses to try to score, looney is there. i feel like jp wasn’t aggressive. great defense and zero offense to back it up@ay0al3k @warriors Q is better@NBABrasil @swish41 @dallasmavs @warriors que bad@warriors Since curry hit the 3point-record man had been shooting bricks bro…find another record for curry to break so that he will have that mentality back….@Klay_SZN @NadalCurryJaggi @warriors Yall gotta stop with this shit, there's no way this man can win MVP like this, yes his gravity is amazing but who gives a fuck if he can't make open shots. Not showing up multiple times is worse than only winning when you do show up. It doesn't help the MVP conversation.@warriors Omg the whole team had a low scoring night! This isn't on Steph! 🏀 is a team sport. These scores reflect low energy &amp; fatigue. It happens. Coach Kerr will be critical of thm if they didn't fight. He'll be critical of himself if he thinks he didn't have them ready 2play. 🏀💪🏾👟@lancem69 @warriors Your tweet or the game?@warriors Keep your heads up and stay strong.@Bullet237 @WestGoat @warriors nahhh he’s not a lakers fan. based on his comment, he’s a lebron dick rider 🤣🤣🤣.

That's the game@Utdprateek1 @warriors Nope we didn’t, Stephen curry forgot how to shoot@warriors Rest Curry for the entire season, and just ship him off to the Bahamas or something.

Every time Draymond has the ball at the top, the opposing team knows he's either going to find Curry coming off the screen or pass it to the screener. Imo, it would be really nice to see Curry handle the ball more.@DDDGURU @warriors Something else up with Curry and isnt physical@04hamsuke @warriors we've been through this before real fans know that. we just gotta keep pushing through and keep supporting no matter what.the fuck was that @warriors@warriors 💛💙💛💙💛💙

Goodbye Warriors fans.@warriors Horrible shooting performance by the Dubs😕@warriors STOP GOING TO STEPH WHEN HE IS PLAYING TRASH. I don't understand why we force feed a struggling Steph when Wiggins is cooking@warriors Nobody is scared of Warriors. Curry overrated, plays no defense, and always chokes in playoffs. Draymond can’t score. Wiggins a walking brick. Iguodala washed. Klay’s return won’t matter - he is old and washed. Poole will fall off with less mins. NOBODY scared🤣🤣.

Come on.@warriors @StephenCurry30 Steph you got the record for most 3s in consecutive games, please stop focusing on it! Your pulling your team down! I wish KLAY is back so we will have a consistent player who is not chasing anything!@warriors @NBCSAuthentic Wake up warriors!@NBA @warriors @dallasmavs Mavs made this run off midrange@warriors @NBCSAuthentic 75 points with a few minutes to go is really, really badPoint of emphasis for the Warriors-

When playing defense, and an opponent takes a dribble and move away from your basket... look out... because they are going to come back and take that space.  

Doncic has been spamming that move all night, and getting calls.

@warriors@WutRWeEvenDoing @warriors @NBCSAuthentic yea if the refs call all for mavs easy win for sure@warriors Thanh’s what you guys get, 3 points my ass.20 percent? Change the way you guys play when shit hit the fan. 3 points my ass. Go the guck home.@CFC_Isaiah @warriors @NBCSAuthentic its overGolden State Warriors Over 214 -110 [1]❌ https://t.co/1HqmNOA96t@warriors Game over. The travel must have screwed them up since it is the entire team off. Poole with 6 is not enough. Curry still off with a back to back tomorrow. Curry should probably rest since he has knee issues.@warriors @NBCSAuthentic They were down one i look up and now they’re down like 20@YTJosiahGaming @warriors STOP@warriors @NBCSAuthentic Onto the next one guys.@warriors We need Otto@warriorsworld Its easy! Refs are running this game! When the #Warriors gets an itch, its a foul! When Luca sneezes, its a foul against the whole @warriors squad! 🤦🏻‍♂️Dallas has been really good at running Golden State off the 3pt line. 

Warriors running the clogged toilet offense as a result. 

Also really missing OPJ tonight.Not the Dubs night.  

I absolutely think the Warriors should sit Steph and Dray (and Looney?) tomorrow night.  Steph, for one, looks incredibly fatigued from getting fouled so much without any call in sight.  They deserve some rest...

Good game.

@warriors #DubNation@NBA @Money23Green @KlayThompson @warriors @StephenCurry30  the refs are doing a good job to get the W for the mavs. Oh yeah, they  don’t wanna ruin the night.. this is a controversy on going.@mcuban It’s nice to be able to watch the @dallasmavs play in #Dallas on @espn on @swish41 night… @BallySportsSW #sucks #gomavs beat @warriors https://t.co/UXxl2JbzXnY’all deadass? @warriors@jichanrosmi @warriors He’s also selling in this gamethe noble golden state warriors throwing for dirk's big nightYou guys are shit sometimes @warriors@warriors @NBCSAuthentic Time to get a new TV and Wi-Fi. I can’t watch warriors on twitter@warriors @StephenCurry30 @22wiggins Not in the 4th.@warriors ugly gameAfter getting within 76-75 with 8:19 left, the Warriors gave up a 12-0 run to fall behind 88-75. Really rough stretch right now on both sides of the ball for Golden State. Curry is now 5-for-22 from the field, including 4-for-15 from inside the arc..@warriors release damion lee and get better announcers@warriors @NBCSAuthentic I blame this loss on Kerr and Steph. Wtf kind of starting lineup is that why tf would he keep Poole out of the starting lineup especially when mans just dropped 30 the other game and Steph Is just out there running@warriors I strongly recommend that Ker should have Curry rest one or two games to recharge!!!With 5:46 remaining in the game 5 team fouls called on the @warriors 
Only 1 called on @dallasmavs 

Yeah right.@warriors wake up wtf@SC30szn_ @warriors They're losing because of Curry@CFC_Isaiah @warriors @NBCSAuthentic Haha keep dreaming, apparently we can’t get a good win streak anymore 😪@warriors @NBCSAuthentic Dunknation!

Mavs playing some good "d", but those layups! 🤦🏾‍♂️@cksncrmbby @warriors He’s not making any of his shots what are you talking about…Get the sports psychologist on the phone this is insane @warriors@warriors @NBCSAuthentic Nothing beautiful about this ball3s are not going in man find another way @warriors@marclamonthill @AlJazeera @TempleUniv @Braves @Morehouse @Chiefs @warriors .@marclamonthill  *of the fact

I think @AlJazeera is in the perfect position to push a new type of journalism that calls on American Indian scholarly/journalist voices from across the United States. (A large percentage of #mmiw violence happens in eastern and Southern US)@warriors Game is blocked out for my area, being the bay area on ESPN. No more NBC Sports so where is everyone watching from@andyinthe209 @warriors Look at the box score. I was rightHave some fucking pride @warriors@warriors @NBCSAuthentic Everyone been telling me this team is the best team in NBA ??Between @NBCOneChicago and @warriors dont know who stressing me more...@MeAkkiian @warriors I didn’t wanna know, we still got the best record in the league tho 🥲🥲 so that’s good! Just need to Steph to start playing like he’s Stephen Curry againque ruim esse time Golden State Warriors einCome on @warriors let’s go!!!@warriors can you pls win 😒@DDDDee2020 @bulldog2297 @warriors @NBCSAuthentic it’s the fact that he’s missing wide open layups too@warriors @NBCSAuthentic Easy win for the Mavs tonight. For one simple reason: Kerr won't adjust for the horrible 3PT shooting. He'll say just keep shooting. Instead of changing the gameplan and telling guys to attack instead. Bad coach is bad.@JuniorEbong God will punish this Golden state Warriors for me 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭@warriors  trade him @StephenCurry30Do the  @warriors want to win this game? Are they playing for the back to back?@Exauce96160799 @Angel19261331 @warriors @NBCSAuthentic Curry looks so worried about everything, it breaks my heart@DDDDee2020 @warriors @NBCSAuthentic I think he got personal problems. His head is not in the right place@Exauce96160799 @bulldog2297 @warriors @NBCSAuthentic i’m sure he’ll come good tho, just in a slump rn@warriors @NBCSAuthentic Why the f is steph still on the court? Literally anyone else would've been benched after the firsst few minutes with that performance. Disgusting. This isn't an off day anymore, dude needs to hit the gym and work on his game@warriors wyd? Wake up ffs@aaannu__ @warriors Now you know what us Celtics fans have to go through🥲@ChrisLew717 @Money23Green @warriors @warriorsworld he just checked back in 💯WTF IS WRONG WITH YALL! @warriors play like the team you are please 😭😭Who provides rim protection for the Mavs?  

What's going on here, @warriors ?

Stop bricking up somewhat contested threes and attack the rim. That should open things up.

Poor first half for the Dubs. Good defense though.

#DubNation@warriors What happened. You dont know how to shoot now?!this game 🙄 @warriorsNo foul ref 👀 @warriorsWhen Klay returns, trade Steph @warriors@soulbets @Money23Green @warriors @warriorsworld Was wondering the same thing@warriors @NBCSAuthentic Curry bogus.@warriors @NBCSAuthentic steph playing like trash for a month@marclamonthill @AlJazeera @TempleUniv @Braves @Morehouse @marclamonthill - institutions such as @Morehouse (your current school?) operate in status quo in the shadow of @Braves franchise without public condemnation against the fact that #notyourmascot (@Chiefs, @braves, @warriors, etc) propel violence against American Indian women@warriors @NBCSAuthentic Curry 0/6Golden State Warriors @ Dallas Mavericks (7:30 PM ET)
Selection: Dallas Mavericks +6Has to be the worst I’ve seen @warriors shoot the three in a while. 1 for 12 halfway through 2nd qtr 🤮@warriors put me on bruh, this the worst basketball I’ve ever watchedget it together @warriorsWhat’s happening with @Money23Green he’s not on the court @warriors @warriorsworld #NBATwitter@warriors @NBCSAuthentic Does Van Gundy ever shut up?@warriors @NBCSAuthentic Curry with his head up his ass thinking about ayesha getting the train ran on her. Can’t make a bucket.@warriors @NBCSAuthentic Something is clearly wrong with Steph@NBA This is strictly a defensive game between the warriors and Dallas but I think that the Golden State warriors started watching the old Knicks trap tapes I think that's why they're so successful around here and they also have Steph lol@sldrobac @bulldog2297 @warriors @NBCSAuthentic He was good in the first half but he’s been bad in the last 2 months . He’s more points because he’s played more games than other scorers .@apple25572026 @warriors @NBCSAuthentic brudda broke the record and forgot how to shoottrade curry @warriors@warriors @NCTsmtown_DREAM Mark doin the hot sauce dance I cantt yes we see u@warriors Pretty good, eh 🇨🇦 https://t.co/bj317kdxYggolden state warriors melhore@warriors @NBCSAuthentic currryyy bro 🤦🏼‍♂️Think ima watch the nets game over this trash ass bullshit. @warriors@warriors @NBCSAuthentic Tell Curry that the ball goes in the hoop@warriors @ChaseCenter @NCTsmtown_DREAM can’t believe this happened chenle successful fan@Cein_Cully98 @warriors @NBCSAuthentic What does bron have to do with this.

He’s missed 12 shots in a row@warriors @NBCSAuthentic Nice but we’re in the 2nd quarter and still not locked in.

Doncic leads all scores with 9pts. #41Forever #FightingSpirit #DubNation #MFFL@warriors vs @dallasmavs 1st Quater comes to a end.
Dallas Leading Scorer: Luka with 9 points 3/5 FG 3 rebounds and 1 AST.
