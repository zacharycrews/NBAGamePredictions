Evan Mobley is back and for some reason, the Nets aren't very good at home. I think this is a tight game, and 8.5 is a big number.

Cleveland Cavaliers +8.5 (currently -110 everywhere)One of two players averaging 25+ PTS and 10+ AST since the All-Star break üåü

Losing Rubio when they did was the biggest blow.@JScottShep @cavs Also I keep thinking about next year if they bring back Rubio and then Sexton is back those two plus Love can form one helluva 2 unit for JB. Depth, Depth and more Depth.@JXW727 @cavs It's lottery protected, the pick in the LeVert trade. I think everybody outside the 8 is in the lottery. 12 or 13 is a sweet spot for shooters.@JScottShep @cavs The pick thing I am not actually sure about and yes the injuries killed a great season.@JXW727 @cavs I decided it's win-win. If they don't make the 8, they get a lottery pick, right?
