More NBA from me: https://t.co/LGN9cVpeGP@TyJohnsonNews Things could be worse. We could be the New Orleans Pelicans and their first round pick Zion Oden. It's funny, most people said he would be the next Oden and it's coming to fruition. He is going to walk away with $44 million when it does happen so it's not the end of the world.ORLANDO MAGIC +2.5

No faith in the Mavs laying this many points. They have some serious depth issues. Pels 5-4 this year when spread was +5 to +8. Dallas just 1-3 when spread was -5 to -8.
