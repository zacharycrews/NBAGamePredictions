Crowd was loud and very drunk. The only game they won. Going to Giants vs Dallas next week!@ATLHawks Start the hype train for a @jcollins20_ vs @MilesBridges #DunkContest NOW! Hoping your team &amp; Charlotte get to meet in the playoffsAnybody that watches @AtlantaFalcons expecting a win or some sort of dominant performance, is not realistic and setting themselves up for heartache.. we just not there yet, I watch for development at certain spots just as I did the @ATLHawks 2-3 years ago..@MattWinerTV @WorldWideWob @steve21smith 
Check box score in the @ATLHawks vs @hornets  game. I think we need to start the hype train for a @MilesBridges vs @jcollins20_ dunk contest now.. We only have a few weeks! I think they are the best players on each of their teams. Agree?The Minnesota Timberwolves have won 5 straight at home and are 7-3 in their last 10. 

They should keep the momentum going against Trae Young and the Atlanta Hawks.

He doesn’t even try on D@AllFlySZN @HornetsFanPage @DeadNyro @ATLHawks we didn’t play good either ??The LaMelo Ball, Terry Rozier, Mason Plumlee, Jaden McDaniels-less Horncats beat the Atlanta Hawks. The Hawks, on their second game of a back to back, play a Timberwolves team that may be getting Pat Beverly, Jaden McDaniels, and Karl-Anthony Towns back tomorrow.@SheikYerbouti20 @ATLHawks At least its not 79-152🥲@ATLHawks Hold anotha L@ATLHawks TELL CAM TO PLAY I DONT CARE ABOUT HIS FUCKING WRISTfuck y’all @ATLHawks@jzselling @HornetsFanPage @DeadNyro @ATLHawks hornets played their worst possible offensive game last time they played and still nearly won 💀💀@AFCPasha @TheAcunacorn @ATLHawks didn’t have a g league team at all but ok@HometeamBleak @StateFarmArena @AtlantaFalcons @ATLHawks @680TheFan Apparently they did look past Charlotte, Atlanta is missing people too, but should be adjusted to them.@SarahSearcy15 @ATLHawks You finally got to use it@ATLHawks Really bad home loss.@SheikYerbouti20 @ATLHawks Nah they sold again, BAN THE YELLOW UNIFORMS#atlvscha @atlhawks @kevin_huerter uses nice pick by @jcollins20_  to get the open look.
