The first was against the Bulls on 12/23/88. Here’s the second, which gave Charlotte an 89-88 win over the Jazz on 1/26/89: https://t.co/2PsSAwIdIO https://t.co/6HmiVfOGOQVia @Forbes/@ForbesSports 

The Charlotte Hornets have a young core of keepers, and some pieces they could afford to move around for positions of need.

One player, in particular, they should target? Sacramento Kings center Richaun Holmes.
