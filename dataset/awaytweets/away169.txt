Morris brothers have been serving hard fouls. Now, they've to stick to just playing basketball because #NBA eyes are on them.
If you deal it, be prepared to receive it back.
#NBAonTNT @NBA @MiamiHEAT https://t.co/LkYDq3X4cEThe Miami Heat's shenanigans after the Denver game waiting out in the hallway for Nuggets players is a product of how soft the league has gotten.  I view what happened no differently than when Chris Dudley threw a basketball at Shaq for a cheap shot. Not a big deal.@maddenjesus_ @MiamiHEAT Jokic came out said he saw the plays, saw how he reacted, and apologized, said he needed to do better as a person. Real boss talk. That's how you handle it.@MiamiHEAT ANTHONY@StevenKelsey13 @MiamiHEAT And they can’t lock down Jokic brothers.

I’d also take an 80% klay over healthy oladipo anyday. Oladipo has had more injuries than klay and hasn’t played at least half a season since 2017. And oladipo is not the same 🤷‍♂️@livmoods doing my Heat Dirty. We need this win tonight @MiamiHEAT https://t.co/unADki58QZ@McfcKDB_ @NBATV @MiamiHEAT the celtics aren’t a bad team. don’t forget that’s the same team miami played in the ecf two years ago. not to mention that up until that point, that was the only team that was giving the heat a run for their money leading up to the finals.@MiamiHEAT What are you guys going to stop creaming over those jerseysThe Jokic brothers bought tickets to come to Miami to be at next Nuggets-Heat game 🤔 https://t.co/OMjlLGU94z@GussGonzz @NBATV @MiamiHEAT Heat are ballin, deservedly so but the Bulls should be above the nets@justinlenzer14 @biscaynebucket1 @NBATV @MiamiHEAT Not thybulle ehhh let’s say Tobias@NBATV @GussGonzz @MiamiHEAT Where’s the Bulls???

#GamblingTwitter #NBA #NBA75 #HEATCulture https://t.co/wGe9pv92ub@A_Delgado1109 @biscaynebucket1 @NBATV @MiamiHEAT He could, but luckily he didn’t rely on his athleticism. He’s the second best shooter and a all defensive caliber player. But I agree there’s always a chance he falls off after 2.5 years of not playing professional basketball@YoursTrulyTC16 @MiamiHEAT Hai don't be too sure. Lakers at home aren't easy to beat. But that's a good matchup. Ready for itLove it Jokic Bringing back the Thuggets  
Don't drop shoulders than fall on ground like a bitch Miami heat fake tough guys 

https://t.co/3po8ZEf4FG@MrHeattNation @NBATV @MiamiHEAT Strength of schedule I guess@DwitjustinGilas @NBATV @MiamiHEAT Dipo is out for the heat too. See you November 29 in Miami flogThe Miami heat have sold out the last 456 home games, the 6th longest nba streak of all time https://t.co/OPjP9kehUs@NBATV @MiamiHEAT Why are we still number one 😭we don’t really matchup well with miami heat rn but we finna fight, best believe. #LakeShow@A_Delgado1109 @biscaynebucket1 @NBATV @MiamiHEAT He’s gonna have the same role that Gordon Hayward had in Boston. He’s gonna come off the bench and there will be nights he starts when Butler or Robinson are out and maybe once in a while will break out. Not like missing a corner piece to the respective team like the other 3Tonight's predictions (2/2)

@SacramentoKings beat @spurs 
@nuggets beat @Pacers 
@Suns beat @trailblazers 
@warriors beat @Timberwolves 
@MiamiHEAT beat @Lakers 

What do yall think? Am I going 13/13? Who are you predicting?

@NBARealTalk75 https://t.co/TxxkhekW3JLos Angeles Lakers vs Miami Heat is on ESPN App (US). Co-commentator is Mark Jackson.  For more details see https://t.co/RjWP6i1NBZ #LosAngelesLakers #MiamiHeat #ESPNAppUS@A_Delgado1109 @biscaynebucket1 @NBATV @MiamiHEAT I must’ve forgot how good he was since the last time he played more than 35 games was in 2017 😂🤷‍♂️ dont compare oladipo to klay Thompson that’s just foolish.4s and 5s get it.  @nuggets @MiamiHEAT    https://t.co/AS2fAnloy3@biscaynebucket1 @NBATV @MiamiHEAT Oladipo being out would be like the sixers not having thybulle all year or the Nets without Mills. He’s a good player and can make some impact on certain nights but he’s not the same anymore nor did he prove he worked in the Heat rotation prior to injury.Filing this one under “Last Season Didn’t Happen: Miami Heat Edition.” https://t.co/VYtzmHl9fu@Superd316 @Eric_Esteban @JamesonCoop @FlaPanthers @BallyPanthers @MiamiHEAT @BallyHEAT @HeraldSports Back in the 90’s Wayne Huizenga bought 50% of Sports Channel FL (SCF). Panthers were coming off Stanley Cup final and Marlins won WS in ‘97. Moved games off Over the air channels to cable exclusively to have bargaining power to get cable operators to carry SCF.@justinlenzer14 @NBATV @MiamiHEAT Oladipo is a main piece considering the lack of players on the heat who could break down a defense off the dribble. He would also likely be our best perimiter defender considering how he comes back. But with that in mind i think klays return to form is just as much a ? mark soMiami heat play lakers tonight at 10! Bam Adebayo, Tyler Herro, and PJ tucker are all questionable to play this game@biscaynebucket1 @NBATV @MiamiHEAT The difference with oladipo compared to the other teams missing someone is that oladipo will be a bench guy and might start a game or two in place of Robinson. He’s a filler guy whereas the other teams are missing legit pieces.Check out @KevinOConnorNBA and  @ringer YouTube study on Tyler Herro Is the Miami Heat’s Final Puzzle Piece | The Void | The Ringer https://t.co/F7Hp3s3S3c via @YouTube, Explains how much @raf_tyler has grown this year #heatculture@NBATV @MiamiHEAT Jokic Brothers watching this.Analyzing Wednesday’s Miami Heat at Los Angeles Lakers odds and lines, with NBA expert picks, predictions and best bets.  https://t.co/SDTl9TEMfoI need the Heat to beat Lakers tonight please Lord.

Tip-off at 10:00 pm. #NBA@vkillem Won’t be like that for the Miami Heat he has to control himself@IvSolly @TheLakersReview Need 6’8 Forward Sekou Doumbouya tonight with his 6’11 wingspan for blocking shots. Miami Heat believe in physicality. Those were CUPCAKE TEAMS compared to this opponent.@LeBrawnGainz @ChefTrillie_ I can't imagine getting mad about an article praising the Miami Heat because of a damn headline lol@SeweIIStrong @MiamiHEAT Be normalWhen your Squad is about that Life @MiamiHEAT #Miami @MiamiDadeCounty https://t.co/POBXLu5mLsThe Miami heat fanbase never gonna forgive Lebron for leaving them 🤣🤣🤣🤣 https://t.co/b4exwQXSoz@TheNBACentral First we had Jimmy Butler vs TJ Warren

Now we got Jokic vs the Miami Heat@nbacommish17 Go to a Miami Heat Twitter group and you will see the smoke. Also 3 TO means he knew he was having a bad game and didn’t press. When Russ isn’t playing well he makes it worse. 1-13 with 2 TO, is diff than 1-13 w/ 7-10 TO.My job lucky this Heat/Lakers wasn't on Thursday because mannnn PTO, prepare the others lol Let's get it done tho Miami!! https://t.co/8U17BvZSNb#MIAvsLAL

Tonight; We’re in the City of Angels as The Miami HEAT start the front end of Back2Back in LA.

If we get jimmy and the Morris brothers family involved that’s different.To give you an idea of how valuable Miami's bench lineups have been so far, the Heat have a +15.0 per 100 *differential* with Dewayne Dedmon on the floor (133 minutes). Largely offensive value added.NBA and NCAAB

One thing that stands out: you don’t need a KD-type iso player to succeed in the iso-game.

Heat got absolutely pumped by the Nuggets, and flattened by Jokic. But, I am confident the Heat will bounce back, with Lowry doing a hell of a lot better.

Whatever helps you.@RitmoNba @aaronontiveroz @MiamiHEAT @nuggets @BallArenaDenver NBA League pass el desenlace....@5ReasonsSports Why even give the option of the anti miami heat part if you’re discussing race?Denver's Nikola Jokic suspended, Heat's Markieff Morris fined  #NBA

https://t.co/yQd2G9LgWE1 game.  About right.  We can live with it.  Still whooped @MiamiHEAT so all good 💪🏼.@FranchiseDay @AIR305 @MiamiHEAT @MiamiHEATstore thanks got oneThe Miami Heat are one of the franchises that has carried the NBA for the last 20 years. Denver does nothing for the league and yet, we now know who the NBA will side with during these moments. A one game suspension is absolutely nothing. He deserved 20. https://t.co/TVtlKFs55a@neun9DENSUKE @HarrisonWind Two 40 year old flabby guys? Yeah, I think Heat with their ex special forces security guys and 50 off duty Miami cops will be just fine. One of those punk brothers got nailed for beating up a girl. Yeah, real tough.Alright I'll be the one to say it
