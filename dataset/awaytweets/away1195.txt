Avoidable mistake 🤦🏻‍♂️@jazzlynn626 Orlando " Magic " https://t.co/FXNBvdSb86@OrlandoMagic @Lions0607 @MichelobULTRA @RjHampton14 Can you link it please? I can’t find it in the online shop@carterjrstan @OrlandoMagic Rogoski put a TON of muscle on Dwight. He added actual value. 

What can you say this training staff has done that hasn’t been sub par? 

Fultz coming back from an ACL injury past the typical timeframe? No. 

Preventing injuries? No. 

Significant muscle gains? No.@jj4t12win10 @carterjrstan @OrlandoMagic I’ve seen plenty of studies and it makes sense that you can re-injure the other one, haven’t seen anything that shows it increases likelihood of rolling the other. Not saying that’s not the case but I can’t think of any examples and haven’t seen data to support it@br_orlandomagic @KawhidoVasco damn is that a Kawhi no Vasco reference?@DosunmuSZN_ @KTS_OGBNG @OrlandoMagic @PapaJohnsORL These people unserious man😂@HornetsOnBally @hornets @OrlandoMagic @ashahahmadi @WesGotRange We gotta win this game Y'ALL!!@OrlMagicMan @carterjrstan @OrlandoMagic I don’t think it is anymore based on a large data set &amp; it being so dramatically different than other teams. 

Other teams know that if you injure one side, the player tends to overemphasize the other etc etc and they go through steps to prevent it. 

I respect the pros at this@HornetsOnBally @hornets @OrlandoMagic @ashahahmadi @WesGotRange Lets goooooo @ashahahmadi and @WesGotRange!!!!!!!!!!!@CharlieBattiste @OrlandoMagic @MichelobULTRA @RjHampton14 Somebody needs to reach out to their design team this is getting out of hand 😂Feels good to be home!

Kobe Bryant trolls the Denver Nuggets https://t.co/YSEsvBvgt1 via @YouTube@bronhistory And yet they blame him for not making it to the finals to face Kobe. Truth is matchups matter in basketball and the Orlando Magic were a bad matchup for Cleveland. Cleveland bigs could not contain Dwight and the Magic who played inside-out basketball.

A: https://t.co/6ymXkpcQrkCharlotte is playing Orlando at home tonight where the Magic give up the 2nd most 3PM to opposing PGs.  LaMelo also shoots the 3 ball much more at home compared to away, averaging 8.0 3PA at home vs. only 7.0 3PA away.@MattyWorldPiece Don’t think Vooch will come back. He is in a good situation to win in playoffs which far far away for Orlando Magic.
