HITTING A BUMP IN THE ROAD WILL NOT DETER THEM! And I DEFINITELY DID NOT LIKE THE LAUGHING &amp; MOCKING BY BUTLER &amp; HERO. NO NEED OF SUCH “CHILDISH ANTICS” IN PROFESSIONAL SPORTS! A TRUE PROFESSIONAL DOESN’T RESORT TO SUCH BEHAVIORS!@coraliew @celtics @smart_MS3 He needs to shut down buckets@celtics LEEEEEES GOOOO GREEEEENFirst good news for the Boston Celtics is Center Al Horford has cleared health and safety protocols for Game2 vs Miami…and now, MORE good news as Guard Marcus Smart is expected back for Game2 after missing Game1 w/ a foot injury #NBA @celtics@brandon_lirio22 @celtics Not if it's smart physicality. Just pressuring him with minimum contact isn't going to draw fouls. They just have to force him to make bad shots and not jump into him or try to win the ball unnecessarily@CoachAC_NFT @celtics I hate these late starts lol I’m a grandpa543 Boston Celtics +1½@ParlayQueen @celtics @MiamiHEAT Thank you!

The Miami Heat got the No. 1 seed in the Eastern Conference.

Accordingly, they got an easier path in the first 2 rounds than the Boston Celtics+Milwaukee Bucks, who got the 2nd and 3rd seeds.

Golden State x Boston Celtics na final da NBA 😃Noticing a trend from the Milwaukee series in which every game the Celtics lost, we had a bad 3rd quarter. @celtics if we want to win, you gotta play aggressive the second the second half starts. NEVER get complacent and DOMINATE the way #CelticsNation knows you can!

Horford &amp; Smart will be back. @celtics will out tough &amp; outscore the @MiamiHEAT Jimmy don't have Ruff Riders with him. Strus, Vincent, and Herro? GTFOH 😂 😂 😂 Celtics in 6. Tatum Nervous/Stiff = Loss
Tatum Confident/Aggressive = Win 🏆I don't know how to feel about this. 
Love both teams...
