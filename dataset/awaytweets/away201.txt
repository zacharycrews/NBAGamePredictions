Atlanta Hawks vs Orlando Magic https://t.co/HMIbUHFeu7With Suggs out tonight, it’ll be nice to see Gary Harris show us something, especially on the offensive end.

And if they were tanking, this is the first piece of PR they'd put out.

Can Cole Anthony Bring the Magic Back in Orlando? // ONE37pm https://t.co/tRa7Qrx764Seems I missed the memo where Magic fans were getting the pitchforks out to force the @OrlandoMagic to give us an update on @MarkelleF and @JJudahIsaac injury status but I’m all for it@unitedweare23 @Belgian_Magic @OrlandoMagic They have the team headed where it needs to be. Starting from the ground up with a TON of young talent is among the best of ways to be successful in the NBA. There is zero reason to not be confident in this front office.@unitedweare23 @Belgian_Magic @OrlandoMagic You know this front office is relatively new right? They inherited the MESS that Hennigan left behind and still managed to drag that sorry ass core to the playoffs. Then they FINALLY did what we were all asking for and tore that garbage apart.@Goodfella0 @DavidBaumannORL @OrlandoMagic @MarkelleF @JJudahIsaac They add to the talent pool of the team significantly so it would be great to see them but you’re right, those two alone aren’t going to fix the issues we’ve seen with the team@DavidBaumannORL @OrlandoMagic @MarkelleF @JJudahIsaac Just tell us when. I don’t care if it’s not until January, just tell us!@Belgian_Magic @OrlandoMagic Probably not tanking but making "damn" sure their investments are truly 100% healthy so no more in and out of the line ups...just my guess@BeenKnightedUCF @Belgian_Magic @OrlandoMagic Trust the office… 😂😂😂😂 have you seen how bad we have been for a long time? What are we going to do just keep getting draft picks without developing our core@Belgian_Magic @OrlandoMagic I guess we don’t see eye to eye there and that’s fine...I trust the front office to do what it takes to steer this young group in the right direction@Court_Cousins @OrlandoMagic I have the same worry, I think many fans do. Something’s not right.The Magic are in Atlanta tonight, and got off to a bad start in this matchup, as Atlanta won the first six games ever from 1989-1991.

It wasn’t until April 16th, 1991 that Orlando finally beat the Hawks, with Scott Skiles going off for 25 points, 9 assists and 9 rebounds. https://t.co/od3r2sxaqW@BeenKnightedUCF @OrlandoMagic I honestly do not believe it’s in our or their best interest to sit JI or Markelle if they’re healthy. They need to improve by playing. I actually think JI at least suffered at setback they’re not telling us about.@Big_Chuma_okeke They're the best @OrlandoMagicI feel really, really good about the Orlando Magic to win outright tonight. I know it sounds like a homer pick, but fellas, I can’t bet with my heart when my heart is already ice cold to this organization. How are we only +10.5 against a team who just beat MIL?@OrlandoMagic @TerrenceRoss @RjHampton14 he's the goat of course@TheNBACentral Ahhh all this @OrlandoMagic love@OrlandoMagic @TerrenceRoss @RjHampton14 I’ll get that fb some day@Belgian_Magic @OrlandoMagic I feel this.

https://t.co/q77wMIjfkAThe Hawks are currently 10.5-point favorites against the Magic tonight... if you enjoy that sort of thing.

No injury report yet for ATL on the back-to-back, but Hunter and Okongwu are definitely out.

Orlando is still without Isaac, Fultz and MCW, with Jalen Suggs questionable.Do you know what's cool? The weather and TerraMia's "Fall Flavors." Come to our Altamonte Springs ristorante &amp; wine bar to experience great cool weather dishes like our Ragu Della Dominica. @TerramiaFL @CityofAltamonte @SeminoleCoFL @OrlandoCitySC @OrlandoMagic @citybeautiful https://t.co/VdRj4jfd0s@nbatopshot Mo Bamba doing some nice things for the @OrlandoMagic !I know the Orlando Magic are cheeks, but the Hawks laying 10 on the second night of a back-to-back seems like a lot.#NBAMagicPolls Does Markelle Fultz play basketball this week?

Basketball. NBAHow many of these next 3 games are must wins?

Game 1: Indiana Pacers (at MSG)
Game 2: Orlando Magic (at MSG)
Game 3: Houston Rockets (at MSG)The Magic will look to bounce back tonight in Atlanta. 

Jalen Suggs is questionable to play tonight due to a right ankle sprain suffered in Saturday’s night game against the Wizards.

WE💥G O T💥ALOT💥P O P P I N G@itisuhhhhot Checked with him; He is most unhappy with the Orlando Magic’s logo, doesn’t think people can tell a Panther from a Jaguar, but he mostly thinks “birds are a dumb mascot, they’re weak compared to other animals and people.”Yes, destroy the ever so dominant Orlando Magic and prove to us how slept on you were 😂 https://t.co/F9gmJ6JripJoin @playersonlynft discord group and vote for @BALLERZ_NFT so that @mcarterwilliams from @OrlandoMagic will play an NBA game with ballerz NFT art on his shoes! Let’s see if one of @mcuban’s players from @dallasmavs can match that! Remember to RT this!

https://t.co/egCg3fy7EGIf you ever wondered what it was like to attend an Orlando Magic vs. Phoenix Suns game in the Penny/Shaq Golden Age, when Barkley was still formidable, this is not far from the vibeI was absolutely on a Naval military base in Orlando, doing one of the following:

Playing or running a Rifts campaign, or
Playing Ani-Mayhem or Magic: the Gathering, or
Watching dubbed anime vhs tapes on the 13inch tv in my room, or
Watching a movie at the nearby theater. https://t.co/XsH1Nu88MK@OrlandoMagic @FieldsAuto @TerrenceRoss @chuma_okeke @franzboogie @thats_G_ Please get a win 🙏🏿The all-black upper with varsity royal hits was worn by T-Mac during his final season with the Orlando Magic.

Read: https://t.co/7HKdno1tRZ@Sugar_Super_Ray @UM_radio_Mic What’s the name of the object the Orlando Magic and Miami Heat play to claim at the end of the season?

I just heard a collective “huh?”@bykevinclark @ringer After your successful campaign to bring back the old Orlando Magic song, is a lost song from an NFL team next?@DavidBaumannORL @OrlandoMagic @MarkelleF @JJudahIsaac Agreed I really hope it’s soon cause I would love too see this team at full strength.@OrlandoMagic Bring back the pinstripes while you’re at it.@bykevinclark @ringer Do you think the Orlando magic video last night at Amway arena reverberated so hard that it effected Tampa’s ability to focus on the redskins today@fools_gd I had Orlando Magic!
