#NBA #NBA75 #BradleyBeal #Wizards #Washington #WashingtonFootball #BreakingNews #DCAboveAll #CourtSideHeatI know it's shocking that the NFL owner with the biggest Napoleon complex has named his team the Commanders. On the upside, it's not the dumbest name in Washington (ahem, Wizards). Also on the upside, everyone will call them the Commies, which in turn can be the RedScare.@cfpisbiased @AdamSchefter Not at all.

Eventually you get numb to the name and it starts to sound normal. 

Commanders is not bad and the design is better than the Redskins branding was.In part of my recent interview with Capital City Go-Go GM Amber Nichols, she discussed her role with Washington and connection with Wizards General Manager Tommy Sheppard. https://t.co/uW2cfoMaRgAnalyzing Wednesday‚Äôs Washington Wizards at Philadelphia 76ers odds and lines, with NBA expert picks, predictions and best bets.  https://t.co/hhVg1Wz397@XXXMEEZY @luckykarms817 @matthewv42 Yea unless you‚Äôre a Wizards fan, not many people watching Washington play.I agree with that.Bradley Beal is holding the entire Washington Wizards organization hostage till he signs his super max, (which they shouldn't give to him)The Philadelphia 76ers are finalizing a swap to send guard Ben Simmons to the Washington Wizards in return for Bradley Beal, sources say.@LauraCohenSolo I agree. There‚Äôs something about DC teams. Do you remember when the Washington Bullets became the Washington Wizards?So the Washington DC area has 4 major sports teams:
Capitols (NHL)
Nationals (MLB)
Wizards (NBA)
Commanders (NFL)

Not the most creative or motivative slew of team names imo.[Fischer] Despite Beal's past flirtations with leaving the Wizards, the All-Star guard has by all accounts signaled plans to re-sign in Washington this summer. The Wizards can offer Beal a five-year, $242 million extension, that's one year and roughly $6‚Ä¶ https://t.co/NfjXE2hsHh@20002ist @GeorgetownMet I don‚Äôt remember hearing anyone propose the Washington Press back then though it would have been a great name.  Just about any name would be better than the Wizards which I thought was awful when announced and still awful today.@PinkNightmare8 Starting to think it must be a rule where you have to pick a ‚Äúpatriotic name‚Äù if you are a DC sports team. I definitely agree they needed to change from Redskins but. Commanders, Nationals, Capitals, DC United, DC Defenders .. the only exception there is the Washington Wizards.DC Missed a chance to get all the nerds into sports, coulda named them the washington warlocks or some other fantasy shit, then we got the wizards and the mystics, change caps and United the druids and babarians or sum, and we could have a whole dnd party worth of sports teamsRanking of the logos for Washington teams

WAY better than the Washington Bullets changing their name to the Wizards, IMO.People crushed Wizards and Nationals early on too. Now it's normal. It'll be tweaked over the next couple years as things settle in and we will get used to it, as we do all things.

I just want them to get a quarterback. Call them the Washington Sillies for all I care. https://t.co/oOdbFRdKhCThey should have changed the color scheme of the jerseys to Red, White and Blue like the Washington Capitals, Nationals and Wizards. https://t.co/0dsDTfMos2Washington...

I can see a Protest March in Washington DC if Dan Snyder goes through w) Commander name.
Redskins have some die hard fans.
Commanders evoke nothingness.
The Wizards have done ZERO since name change from  Bullets Champions to Loooosers. Same w) Redskins‚Ä¶Wizards down 53-40 to the Bucks at halftime

Washington shoots 35% from the field and have 9 turnovers without Bradley BealEnd 2Q: Bucks 53, Wizards 40.
Washington shooting just 35 percent. Nine different players have scored, but no one in double figures. 
Allen leading the way for the Bucks with 10. Giannis being a facilitator today with 8 points, 8 rebounds and 7 assists.@CarolynKarl Sounds like it was great for your family then. That's pretty cool. I just know a lot of Nationals fans that go out of their way to shit on the O's fans. But you know, I have to be nice to both sides because being a Washington football/Caps/Wizards fan and all that.you're not allowed to complain about the Washington Commanders if you haven't vented about the stupidity of Washington "Wizards" since 1997@wojespn More reason for the Wizards to blow up the roster - they're going nowhere, and Beal is likely gone in a year and a half since he's not winning a championship in Washington.@SpiroAgnewGhost Commanders for Washington. What is the baseball team in Cleveland? Guardians.
