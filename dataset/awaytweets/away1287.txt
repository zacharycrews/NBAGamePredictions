#nba #sixers #NBAPlayoffs#Heat vs #Sixers -

Biid back means I utilize the "fade the returning star" play. 

Rotations &amp; egos get funky the 1st game a key guy comes back from prolonged absense. Heats defense is elite, Miamis shooting is elite. Embiid will have to do more than score to help PHI

#HEATCulture https://t.co/CPDrUojya0@godneystuckey If Robinson has an off shooting night he's a liability, and I doubt he becomes better in Casey's system than he already is in Miami. Good catch and shoot guy but not much else, I think we can land a more versatile player and a higher pick (since heat pick ~30th) in a Grant tradeJoel Embiid has CLEARED concussion protocol. The Philadelphia 76ers center is doing everything he can to play in Game 3 tonight against the Miami Heat. https://t.co/mF9u11AwppHey #NFTCommunity we have our first matchup of the night!

Miami has just absolutely dominated this series. The status for Embiid is unknown but I don't think it plays a huge part (still dealing w/ fracture &amp; torn ligament in thumb). Take Jimmy Buckets and the #miamiheat

Even if he does play, the Sixers are not winning this series.@JabbaDuhHo @MiamiHEAT @FTX_Official Lmfao you still talking about last season ain’t even the same team@MDBuccaneer @TimBontemps Miami will win either way then their delusional fans will just bring up embiid not being fully healthy lmao Heat needa just sweep and send that poverty franchise to the off season again.Philadelphia 76ers star Joel Embiid has cleared concussion protocol, reports The Athletic, but it’s unclear as to whether Embiid will play in Friday’s Game 3 against the Miami Heat.

https://t.co/Ed46RIxZyt@themessiah_4 @JabbaDuhHo @MiamiHEAT @FTX_Official Facts!!!!@HeyRosenberg I didn’t pick Heat, but my point was that I would have waited to bet Miami, anticipating this possible news.@FiveLinePasser @alumknight11 @FlaPanthers @MiamiHEAT Disagree. This could be unique to being a South Florida thing. We dont need to do what other hockey teams do up north. If the players enjoy it and it hypes them up then it must be done. Most people enjoy it and actually sign along to the hype portion of the Pepas.We have an incredible lineup for Day 3️⃣ of Brand Innovators Marketing Innovation #BISummit here in Miami &amp; our CEO @TheBrandMaestro is getting us started! 🤩 Meet us at SGWS Wynwood to hear from @ATVI_AB, @HiltonHotels, @DellTech, @PUMA, @hulu, @OceaniaCruises, @MiamiHEAT+ more! https://t.co/juCH3ALmPqThe heat is on! ☀️

Heat lose tonight &amp; we're gonna be headed back to Miami with the series tied 2-2Line now Heat -2 but possibility Embiid's status changes prior to tip means you should hold off on betting Miami if that's your intention https://t.co/B1Vr8pIJR9@MiamiHEAT @FTXArena tweet Lowry back@Processpatel @AProskauer @CoreyB08 You said literally less than 24 hours ago that the Miami Heat will not win a single game that Joel Embiid plays in.

And we’ll have to win 4/5 not 4 straight but I see ya point. Miami have no answers for Embiid and when they double, triple him, that gives Maxey, Tobi etc space to eat.

Sixers have the perfect big to counter that switch (Embiid) and a great guard to orchestrate once they get it (Harden).

He will never sniff Lukas teir@SarahSpain @jasonfitz The @MiamiHEAT getting back to NBA Finals! #HEATCulture https://t.co/Ht9Hn3REVaWould never think I'd say this but @FlaPanthers fans I think are better than @MiamiHEAT fans.  Already hearing "Lets go Panthers!" chants and the puck hasnt even dropped! Much cooler than half empty arena at tip off #HEATCulture #TimeToHunt #NHLPlayoffs #NBAPlayoffs #NBATwitter https://t.co/T3BMTtX1O6This play is why I love Mechanic and Jimmy so damn much. FULL sprint and both of them seal their men and it gives Dipo an open layup. Especially Dedmon who was rebounding on the low block. BEAT HIS MAN down court and Jimmy was already sealing. 

Miami Heat basketball https://t.co/QvO0hq7bbJ@305sportsbabe My first and only time to Miami, I landed in rush hour traffic and needed to get to a Heat game that same night. Not for the weak lolNBA Revolution Inner Case Break

https://t.co/8JkbQZLVpb https://t.co/YOU4OG5MFO@Shot_Quality @Suns @celtics @MiamiHEAT admin is sixers biasgive lewis hamilton a jersey i beg @MiamiHEAT@NBA @MiamiHEAT Happy birthdayThe latest on Lowry and Embiid; the reasons the Sixers are so convinced they're going to get back in this series (Harden says 76ers are coming back to Miami); Wade visit; and bunch of Heat things: https://t.co/sbjlYepYqi@bammy_de @MiamiHEAT 😂 that is what I thought you meantMans couldn’t even average 35+ against the raptors… Miami defense has been on point the past like 2-3 years and our defense this far in the playoffs has been beautiful but yet again here goes another Heat Slander lol https://t.co/DM7RtbfRuF@MiamiHEAT Happy bday Sir.@MiamiHEAT Man PJ bouta injure Jimmy 😂😂😂this guy has to calm the f down@GP33AV @Gr8GreyMatter Heat gonna have to attach something else to trade Duncan. I have doubts he’s an NBA player outside of the Miami system@catfantastic1 @KentuckyMBB @raf_tyler @MiamiHEAT @NBA @lesliegreen12 Ohhh. Gotcha!MVP hopeful and #76ers star Joel Embiid will be out for Game 3 against the Miami #HEAT

She didn’t do the work in the poster and I don’t know who did. She does great work and I was suggesting that UK or anyone who wants work like that done should go to her.Celtics in 5 over mid ass Miami Heat ECF@NBA @MiamiHEAT I miss you on the bucks 😪@RyanNorell @MiamiHEAT Yeah maybe it ‘87 when they announced it.. I was graduating HS 😅@dakishaofyork's account is temporarily unavailable because it violates the Twitter Media Policy. Learn more.@MucciFlipFlop Man, I disliked the logo itself but the black, red and bronze scheme was beautiful. Miami Heat are the American sports jersey pinnacle.Embiid or no Embiid, the Miami Heat would win the series. https://t.co/UYuFmeO9PWWhy does everyone outside of Miami always say Harden to Heat? That Guy is the total opposite of #HEATCulture! He is an amazing scorer, but plays with zero effort on the defensive end and requires the ball every time down the floor to be effective. HARD PASS! https://t.co/kQf37F4vYs@Bklyn929 @BigTicket73 I live in Miami. I’m telling you they got the worst fans across all the sports. They only support their teams when they are good and instantly quit on them. Look at the heat. They doin good. If next season they’re not winning the arena will be empty@F_Pros4life @jpthreesus @Zac58552665 @raf_tyler @MiamiHEAT You obviously don't watch the heat play because if you did you'd know that they do that to ignite offense on the bench. Again if he'd landed on Dallas with zero help on his team, he'd have those numbersI hope: Jokic named MVP &amp; @JoelEmbiid just goes scorched earth in response, carrying @Sixers past @MiamiHeat &amp; all the way to a chip.

I fear: he's nowhere near 100% &amp; it's a quiet/painful 2nd round exit (&amp; an off-season of "what could've been"). 

#PhilaUnite@ajsalinas_18 @MiamiHEAT Just bought this exact one on eBay👀🥵😅 Yung Miamis Mother Has Been Trending All Over Social Media After Popping Out At The Heat Game‼️ Would Yall Buy Her A Drink ? 🤔 https://t.co/Zl46ThvM0PI present to you the worst draft choice in Miami Heat history:

Drafting Precious Achiuwa with the 20th overall pick in the 2020 NBA Draft instead of picking Tyrese Maxey

I remember punching my pillow when this happened
