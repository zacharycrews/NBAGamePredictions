This is a tribute to 3 Kings legends who made sure the NBA &amp; the city of Sacramento could rid itself of a dark cloud that hungover it for over 30 years. All proceeds from the sale of this design will go to social justice causes. 
https://t.co/T0peFw4pos https://t.co/zmJTNkcXC3in the #NBA , Kings do fall into the model's projections as a top play tonight.

Empirically this has been a situation where I have played Sacramento over the years (road dog getting 5+), still breaking down the game, but likely our #FREEPLAY for this evening.@FrescoHagel @SacramentoKings Remember a week ago when they were undefeated? Good times.The best time of basketball season to be a @SacramentoKings is right now.

Whenever the @SacramentoKings come to town I always hope that @DrLydecia and the entire @Rich_Holmes22 family is coming with them. 💜 #HolmesFan4LifePer Cleaning the Glass, the Sacramento Kings are the best team in the NBA at converting in transition this season, while also having the 10th highest frequency of transition opportunities.

With three guards often sharing the floor, their speed &amp; playmaking are well utilized here https://t.co/AhUk0j6Fny@McCannSportsLaw Two sports franchises sharing the same name isn’t unprecedented. Just ask the New York Giants/San Francisco Giants, the Los Angeles Kings/Sacramento Kings, or the Louis Cardinals/ Arizona Cardinals.

But two in the same city? That might be pushing it too far. https://t.co/DFCSr4zgYyContrary to popular belief, the @Suns have not been good against the Sacramento Kings lately.

The Sacramento Kings are built for OVERS.  They were a good offensive team last year when healthy like they are now.  And they were one of the worst defensive teams in the NBA, which is the case for them again this season.@SacramentoKings @SociosHoops I’d bring this guy https://t.co/7zTuyG0MKtSacramento Kings getting ready for a game.

In the NBA, I’m not sure which teams came in first but Golden State Warriors based out of San Francisco also have the LA Lakers, LA Clippers &amp; the Sacramento Kings in the state of California.@SanYEGcisco @ChewieWoolf @SacramentoKings @bflewis3 @TyHaliburton22 @hbarnes @nbatopshot I agree!
@TyHaliburton22 https://t.co/qQLK8C0kT6@ZachCiavoNBA @ARoyalPain @SacramentoKings Do it well to honor people like Tyler Watts and Rafe Wong just to name a few former writers. They put so much time and effort to make it a great site. Be different and better. There is a ton of sites out delivering Kings news. Have fun and congrats.I wanted to say @ChewieWoolf and @bflewis3 would be proud 😂 @SacramentoKings https://t.co/Bsl4fPTyn0@SanYEGcisco @SacramentoKings @ChewieWoolf @TyHaliburton22 @hbarnes @nbatopshot Great moments imo!!!Bought a couple @SacramentoKings and #certifiedballers that I was surprised I didn’t have in my collection. These should be staples in anyones collection. Reasonably priced as well.

It is now in its fifth season. In the 916, the hope is that a new waterfront ballpark project will happen, and that they takeaway how the process played out in #Sacramento for #Oakland.🤝Sacramento Kings Long Sleeve T-Shirt Black
