This is a tribute to 3 Kings legends who made sure the NBA &amp; the city of Sacramento could rid itself of a dark cloud that hungover it for over 30 years. All proceeds from the sale of this design will go to social justice causes. 
https://t.co/T0peFw4pos https://t.co/zmJTNkcXC3in the #NBA , Kings do fall into the model's projections as a top play tonight.

Empirically this has been a situation where I have played Sacramento over the years (road dog getting 5+), still breaking down the game, but likely our #FREEPLAY for this evening.@FrescoHagel @SacramentoKings Remember a week ago when they were undefeated? Good times.The best time of basketball season to be a @SacramentoKings is right now.

The Sacramento Kings are built for OVERS.  They were a good offensive team last year when healthy like they are now.  And they were one of the worst defensive teams in the NBA, which is the case for them again this season.@SacramentoKings @SociosHoops I‚Äôd bring this guy https://t.co/7zTuyG0MKtSacramento Kings getting ready for a game.

-The Sacramento Kings@SacramentoKings @SociosHoops I would bring some steaks and beerOne last play for tonight will be the Sacramento Kings +8 (-110). I debated going first half because of their late game troubles but gonna stick with my original read‚Äî they should keep this one close #GamblingTwitter@Comrade_Cosm0 @bflewis3 @SacramentoKings @nbatopshot @OwnTheMomentNFT actually after further investigation it looks like everything is either corrected or updated. My "all" now shows 19/19. So the name list should be good to go too. What they do on @OwnTheMomentNFT website &amp; @TOCNFT is great stuff#NBA
