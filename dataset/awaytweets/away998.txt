https://t.co/JioZfOCqoLAs fan of the @cavs, it’s in my DNA to hate @StephenCurry30. As a fan of basketball &amp; kind people, it’s hard not to like him. Some athletes don’t realize how much they mean to kids. Kudos to Curry for always making time for his fans. But I’m still mad about ‘15, ‘17, &amp; ‘18 Finals https://t.co/7e0C5r8XGiThe Cleveland Cavaliers are currently the 3rd seed in the Central division, and the 6th seed in Eastern conference with a record of 38 wins and 27 losses.

#NBA #NBAPick #NBAPrediction #Basketball #NBATwitterLive@DevaronPerry I would assume, due to his injury history the @cavs are being cautious with him?

 I would get @dariusgarland22 back in rhythm.

 See what we get out of Goodwin/Frazier, work in Levert and Sexton in the lead up to the playoffs.

 Then in the Playoffs, I would go 10 Deep.Do Cleveland Cavaliers, Caris LeVert still have enough time to get acclimated? https://t.co/iOa8oFLtMa Unfortunately LaVert seems as if he is never able to have a major contribution to the Cavs resulting from a nearly permanent state of fragility.A showdown between Eastern Conference playoff teams will take place at 8pm ET tonight when the Cleveland Cavaliers visit the Miami Heat in Miami.

It’s time to get this worked out!@DuaneGlasco @devong975 The Sixers ain't winning nothing this year you know who the Sixers are? the Sixers are a worse version of the Cleveland cavaliers from 1987-1993 except for that Cleveland team actually got to a East conference final in 1992.Congratulations to bh_buckets who moved up 18 spots to take #19 on the Cleveland Cavaliers team leaderboard.

Stay the 3rd seed and you have a tricky series against the long and defensively elite Cleveland Cavaliers.

Go to the top 2 seeds and you could face the Nets first round 😳 or the Raptors, also have the tools to defend Giannis decently.@NBA2K_MyTEAM No love for my @cavs smhDarius Garland and Evan Mobley @cavs https://t.co/TE6aNPU8dF@JessicaABruns @cavs I love this! I had a pair of Hornets season tickets for a few years (wish I had kept them). It puts you in control of what games you want to go to. Plus with the Cavs playing well, you'll always be able to sell the games you don't go to.Congratulations to pmarquis (@pmarquis), kipstabone, Mbrick03 and deemoney who moved up to take #7, #8, #9 and #10 on the Cleveland Cavaliers team leaderboard.
