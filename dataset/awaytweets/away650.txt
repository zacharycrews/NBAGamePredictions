The Cowboys were a dynasty then. You can‚Äôt compare the Leafs to a team that was decade defining in their sport. The Chicago Bulls same thing. You wouldn‚Äôt compare the Leafs to the Bulls.

The Chicago Bulls never lost a playoff series because of Jordan. It was only because he didn't have adequate help.

Jordan always did everything possible to win every playoff series he played in. It was always the other Bulls' fault when the Bulls were eliminated. https://t.co/v27AUSutDM https://t.co/fbZDMqJFjR@KenWo4LiFe @BIGtimeDC @chicagobulls @IlliniMBB @OldTakesExposed Might be the best response to a ‚Äúthis didn‚Äôt age well‚Äù tweet@swiftybal @casualtakeking uhh what about the Chicago Bulls‚Ä¶ they are actually the most covid ridden team lmao. in the months of december &amp; january every player on their team got covid &amp; they have 7 guys out rn‚Ä¶ we‚Äôre still #1 in the east. no excusesCaruso coming back is big boost @chicagobullshttps://t.co/PST9zdNXsY  After you click on that, you can find all of the NBA Championship Teams.
