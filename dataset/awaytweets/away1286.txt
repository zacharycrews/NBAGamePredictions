I never said his defense was the prob. I was specifically talking about a moment in the game. About how he was struggling that quarter. Nothing else. Nothing more. Y’all get so hurt when someone criticize a player. SheeshDallas Mavericks Courtside

                      ( A Thread) https://t.co/LlyULuEwMU@ewezeey @dallasmavs Seems that way lol@AshNicoleMoss @dallasmavs It's like Dirk all over again except he doesn't even have a Steve Nash. Why won't they let Boban play? Luka needs a big Center and we have one that can ball@rtx_tyler @kristia77129130 @redflyer4435 @AshNicoleMoss @dallasmavs And trust me there is no one saying Luka is a defensive stopper. So stop it@LukaMagicStocks @dallasmavs @mcuban Don't think Lillard would be happy standing on the perimeter watching Doncic dribble, dribble, dribble. I understand he has already talked with KP.@rtx_tyler @kristia77129130 @redflyer4435 @AshNicoleMoss @dallasmavs I’m a clown because I’m telling facts? 🖕🏾.  He literally said it himself.  Having a high defensive ratings means nothing when he’s not guarding the top player  He played terrible defense at times last game usually it’s because he’s tired because he’s usually not in the best shapeGoing to the @dallasmavs game Friday night too, damn this week is turning out great 🤘🏼@hulu_support @hulu I’m about to cancel.
