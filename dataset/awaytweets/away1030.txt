Utah is going to win regardless if he plays or doesn’t. Bulls can’t beat good teams so might as well rest him vs Utah and Saturday vs Phoenix where the Suns will beat the Bulls by 50 pts! Rest him until the playoffs start. Get that knee as healthy as possible.What an exciting @suns season!!!

Even without CP3, the Suns have been rolling since the ASG. The Pelicans have too, but they are missing Brandon Ingram tonight. Even with the game in NOLA, the Pels won’t get enough consistent scoring to hang with Phoenix. https://t.co/csGDx9g2uVBroo why are people angry we was always losing and even if we did win we’re gonna lose against them MANCHESTER UNITED while be in my dua this coming Ramadan until den let’s goooo Phoenix Suns!!!!!!! https://t.co/gJnxHXG9ZESingle-family rent prices are surging at a record rate, led by homes in Sun Belt cities like Miami and Phoenix: Single-family rents were up 38.6% in Miami, compared with just a 2% jump for the city in January 2021. https://t.co/aWoCj0BsAT #Mortgages #Realestate #Housing https://t.co/TGku6Xl7XR@suns_tutu_fan I know he's not on our Christmas Card list but I wonder how much of his maladies in Phoenix weren't spurned on by what he was dealing with + what our culture was like back then with $arver and Babby and Blanks. https://t.co/fWsP56w8xfPhoenix Suns ML &amp; Over 221.5

There isn't enough firepower to keep pace with Phoenix. The Suns are coming off a beatdown of the Lakers. Lost to New Orleans three weeks ago. Off a rest day, it's a nice spot on a short line.
