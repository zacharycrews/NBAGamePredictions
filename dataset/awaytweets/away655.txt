https://t.co/kf6qWa3Ku6Some say the name is a combination of the term for "destroyer" plus Apollo 
(This comes up later in thread)

The phoenix is connected to Apollo because every morning Apollo would watch the Phoenix sing + bathe in a well (+ Apollo=Sun god)In Egyptian mythology the phoenix is the deity Bennu 

The Bennu is related to the capstone on the pyramid, which is called the Benben

The capstone &amp; the obelisk are symbols known to represent the Sun

Bennu represents the soul of Sun god Ra + was called "the ascending one"Devin Booker’s Instagram story puts emphasis in his love for the Detroit Pistons #DetroitPistons #DevinBooker #PhoenixSuns https://t.co/IHUElRlcqT@nbafan_1x24 @Youngboytroll @viitiito @Suns @KeteIMarte @DevinBook @FanDuel Just dropping this comment here to see what he replies with 💀💀@marco_musta @Suns Better than ADisney atleastDetroit Pistons vs Phoenix Suns was on Movistar Deportes HD.

https://t.co/gaMKyaMMYb@NBA @DevinBook @Suns D. Book mid is LegendaryI've mentioned the Phoenix before as a commonly used mythological symbol 

It's an immortal bird, connected to the sun, that dies in a show of flames and is reborn + rises out of the ashes@Jumpshot8 @Suns @warriors It does mean nothing. It’s like a movie, or a concert - entertainment.@Jumpshot8 @ESPNNBA @espn Phoenix Suns are to the NBA as Rodney Dangerfield was to respect,
No respect for the Suns https://t.co/0xg1CrmGfr@ClayCoop22 @SLAMonline @Suns This meme got him shooting the lights out tho... keep it coming@DC4Lx5rings @MiamiGods @Suns Heat Culture only allows them to watch Heat games.@Bleacherdave @Suns @warriors Well don’t watch the game right now against Minny. It means nothing.  We will just keep playing.@johnnyoplaya64 @Bleacherdave @Suns @warriors Only lip service to a person who never played.  The fraternity knows what I mean.  You pledged and got cut.  #waterboy #couchpotato
