#GamblingTwiitter #picks #NHL #NBA #NCAABWhen my oldest was done interning with the Washington Wizards and wanted another opportunity, @CoachLindsayG plugged her w/ the GSW. 

When my youngest asked her about help with real estate mentors, she gave her numerous avenues and connections. 

#LifeCoachThe Washington Wizards could've drafted @StephenCurry30 with the #5 pick but instead traded it (and cash!!!) to the Minnesota Timberwolves for Mike Miller and Randy Foye. 

Of course the Timberwolves fucked up too by using the #5 and #6 picks to draft Ricky Rubio and Jonny Flynn. https://t.co/bbXwOgQN0t@fastbreconomics @so_wizards What compounded it even further to me - Washington executed the trade the day before the draft and did not wait to see who slipped to five. Rubio wasn't expected to be there and the pick would have had more value with him on the board...cont.Consensus Line Move:

https://t.co/aO2eqKm65rIts time to start a dialogue‚Ä¶ State of the Washington Wizards. What to do with Bradley Beal? Are the Wizards toast??  https://t.co/WNJXs0Hlxo via @YouTubeIt's awesome watching Stephen Curry make history. I'll never forget the '09 draft where my Washington Wizards had the 5th pick and their choice of Curry, Rubio, DeRozan, or Jrue Holiday, and instead traded that pick for Randy Foye, Mike Miller, and perpetual irrelevance.Washington Wizards tickets at Capital Arena??  Cheap af for nose bleeds??????@rkenedi Yeah I get it. Lack of real magic was is real lost opportunity for the Washington Wizards especially.
