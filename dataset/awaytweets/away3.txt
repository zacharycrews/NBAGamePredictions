5. Nuggets, bc friendship https://t.co/wzGQssLjSc 
6. Jazz, bc it's a good genreChicago Bulls (42.5). Over. I think they improved as much as any team in the league over the offseason. Vuc, Zach, Demar, and Lonzo are as a competent a foursome as any team in the 2nd tier of the Eastern Conference can boast.
