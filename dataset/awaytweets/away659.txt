#MagicTogether #DarrellArmstrong #GoMagic #OrlandoMagic #KnowYourHistoryWith the Sixers up 73-72, Orlando’s Isaac Austin had his shot blocked and the Magic had to foul with 3.3 seconds left.

Not yet in the penalty, George Lynch couldn’t get the ball in and had to call timeout before causing a 5 second violation.
