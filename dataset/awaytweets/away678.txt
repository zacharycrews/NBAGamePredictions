Here’s my in depth game preview and prediction- 

@TWSN___ 

https://t.co/c6IYZUdGBZNBA- Brooklyn  +1, Miami Heat +2, Memphis + 4 (b1/2),@kirkgoldsberry @Suns @memgrizz @dmorey @MiamiHEAT @dallasmavs @Lakers @BrooklynNets @celtics @warriors @chicagobulls It’s not exactly easy to watch Mavs games.

Barring injuries or matching up earlier, that will be ECF.   There are 3 contenders in the West:  Phoenix, Memphis, and GS.   First two have proven they can win without da stars.  GS tho needs Steph and Dray to have any shot.@feldman_gil @kirkgoldsberry @Suns @memgrizz @dmorey @MiamiHEAT @dallasmavs @Lakers @BrooklynNets @celtics @warriors @chicagobulls Well, big fan of line graphs bud@HeatvsHaters @MiamiHEAT Am I the only one who speed read Okpala as Oladipo https://t.co/DCJa9tkCrC@MiamiHEAT @betwayusa Hopefully more than 13@MiamiHEAT  vs @ATLHawks

Pat Riley for Walter McCarty was a favorable deal. #blessed #humbledMiami heat dwyane wade and ray allen and lebron James and Rushard Lewis and Chris Bosh. https://t.co/zhHen4pRJX@WillManso Another clue is that he refused to acknowledge that the Heat had any influence on James and his vision of building an NBA team. Giving all credit to LeBron even though a majority of his career was spent in Miami. Much longer than anywhere else.Pre-save my new single "MIAMI HEAT FREESTYLE" on Spotify: https://t.co/WlZTOcEQLi (powered by @distrokid)Miami heat dwyane wade and lebron James and Chris Bosh big 3. https://t.co/UZ3Y7c9ZKJ@MiamiHEAT NBA’s Spider-ManMiami heat 2008-09 roster https://t.co/7qPIUv8ZukHeat Lifer 🔥🏀🥵 @MiamiHEAT https://t.co/1P2y7b0LSU@QC00KWRLD @BlakeFountain7 @MiamiHEAT @CoupNBA top 6 behind Kareem for sure@senorapree81 @MiamiHEAT I will call you nothing else from now on!

RT ➡️ #TylerHerro // #NBAAllStar https://t.co/vFfHgaPkFUMore recently the Raptors guard was seen wearing green on green (this time with a shirt) during the Raptors’ win over the Miami Heat. A rather tame outfit on its face but a statement.

“Green is very on trend in the fashion world." https://t.co/2kq7un1OmJ@NevadaSportsNet @NevadaHoops @MiamiHEAT Are they going to give him a regular contract already?  I think he's proven he belongs. Enough of this 2-way crapIt was another strong showing for @NevadaHoops alum Caleb Martin as he puts up 26 point for @MiamiHEAT in a win over Portland last night.
