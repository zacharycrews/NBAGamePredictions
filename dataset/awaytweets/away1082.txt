It let Garland be Garland. Which leaves the Cavs in an interesting position – Sexton's an RFA this summer (I think). Also, they now also have LeVert.Consensus Line Move:

The Knicks have up 2 firsts and 3 seconds to get KAT@Fueledbyair @MrEddieHuang @nyknicks Obi guarded the switches onto guards well. Trae baited him into that layup foul, and the foul at the end of Q3 on that closeout should’ve been let go.

Watch how they execute at crunch time. Most are not "basketball players"@ChunkyMilk05 @blamesdolan_ And puts up 45 on @nyknicks@ATLHawks Good morning @nyknicksThe Knicks looked healthy until the last 4 minutes against the hawks and all I see is “Trae Young owns New York” man stfu@RajChipalu Gotta have the finishing skills first, before you take-on the New York Knicks fanbase. Trae Young put the work in behind the scenes when nobody was watching. It would be nice for the Lakers to find the next Trae Young.@JonErikHutt @nyknicks One of the most depressing seasons given last year and the expectations for the year.@BenRitholtzNBA R.J. Barrett wants to be an ISO-MODE KING, but his finishing skills need more polishing.
The New York Knicks need a point guard that commands respect because of his finishing skills inside the 3-point line.Evan Fournier play for the New York knicks and he needs not to😂😂😂@DarylTh95883545 @nyknicks Plus in EVER single presser after another L he never takes accountability.@nyknicks Why are haters on this page go to New Jersey Nets page1951: Rochester def New York

Game 6: New York def Rochester 80-73

The dream was definitely alive! Being 3-0 down to tying the series, the Knicks had created the closest 3-0 comeback the league had and would ever see in finals history. https://t.co/WJMRJhKFwn@nyknicks @23savage____ And still blew it in 4th. PG desperately needed this off-season @nyknicks1951: Rochester def New York

Game 5: New York def Rochester 92-89.

Extending the series to 6, the Knicks stole another win as both teams saw 5 individuals break double digit points. The Royals won every team category besides trips to the line and points, the ultimate decider. https://t.co/kmZbUruIxU1951: Rochester def New York

Game 4: New York def Rochester 79-73.

In a bid to survive, the Knicks defeated the Royals to avoid the sweep to start the story of the most forgotten all-time finals series in leagues history. https://t.co/mWXuUmXWwv@DarylTh95883545 @nyknicks Yep... Thibs being Thibs in the 4th. He has to be the worse coach or top 3 when it comes to 4th quarter game management and subs decision making.@nyknicks ok go get him! https://t.co/OkzVsACsnn@PlayoffBoundNYK @nyknicks I would rather Grimes in that spot. Obi's defense is mediocre at best.

He just never gets the full opportunity to be the best he can be. It’s like he is being deliberately held back.@nyknicks Weird decisions that Thibs made:
Taj getting 20 minutes, 
Sims getting 13 minutes, 
Quick not getting over 30 minutes, 
Obi not getting over 30 minutes, 
Deuce still not getting enough minutes… 

I swear Thibs is gonna bring Joakim Noah outta retirement &amp; give him 20 minutes.Trae Young owns the Knicks.

No injuries@lucas43591127 @OfficialATL3 @3randyn @HatingTyy @nyknicks simple observation, just funny he “owns” a franchise he doesn’t have a winning record against. go crazy tho man you got me@nyknicks IQ, Grimes, Robinson, Toppin &amp; Deuce got the Knicks the lead by playing good defense but Thibodeau again started taking them out. 1st Grimes then the rest &amp; next thing we know the Hawks had taken the lead on 2 force plays from Barrett doing his Randle roleFantastic win in NYC.  Sent the Knicks fans to the exits early. Great job by Bogi and of course New York nemesis  Larry Wayne I mean @TheTraeYoung ! On to Detroit.Trae put up 45 on the @nyknicks heads tonight !! Lord this kid is special man!!!The only way to keep Trae Young from being the King of New York is banning him from the city.

We need to see more IQ for Burks since the latter has somewhat cooled off. RJ is going to get a lot of attention from the Hawks D, we need more offensive options.

knicks lack that kind of talent period..Can we just put Deuce in strictly for defensive purposes on Trae and have RJ run the offense, sending Burks to the bench.
