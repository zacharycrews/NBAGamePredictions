Answer:  Beer nuts are a dollar fifty, and deer nuts are under a buck.@BillySteinway @ZoraStephenson @Bucks the players on the court, and I complain a lot when they don’t do well, it’s just like Giannis takes care of his body more, he’s got more noticeable biceps that Khris and Giannis is in a lot better shape which is why he doesn’t get as injured often.

I felt the odds on Vuc weren’t worth dabbling. The guard rotation will be very interesting. I see a lot of people liking Grayson, but I think Pat will get better opportunity. They trust him in late game situations, not sure they feel that way about AllenI’m still taking Milwaukee to win this series in 6 or 7 games cuz I gotta see it but tonight’s game will tell me everything about the Bulls chances, the Bucks will come out firing cuz they lost and they have no Middleton, really interested in seeing how they respond to thatMilwaukee Bucks NBA player Luca Vildoza extending his support to @meta_ballers 🔥
