It was going to be a tough one, but he knew he could do it. +@Sportstruth30 @DSarge415 @warriors @Money23Green Not to u ....kid@AngryKlaySZN11 there's a video titled "Robert Downey Jr and Tom Holland talks about Basketball" they did an interview with Jimmy Kimmel and Tom Holland said "My first ever game i went was the Golden State Warriors in New York, so I'm lucky enough now to say that i support the Warriors"@SportingGreenSF @MarcJSpears Here's hoping @warriors and Joe Locab held back a bunch of tickets for fans with lesser resources at reasonable prices, who have supported the team through the move, COVID, the losses, and duel injury wait!

Can't wait to see Klay!

Awesome! They are all, All Stars and MVP’s to me. I just love watching them play, my 72 year old Mom loves watching them play. They are a real team!

Dre has to know about this right? SMH ...I honestly don’t think that any player in any game can have a great game every single time they play. The beauty of @warriors and @StephenCurry30 is that they are there for each other. That makes for a great team! I just love them all &amp; how they play the game.

So who wants to tell @warriors their name needs to change? Since its too similar to the Native American theme?@El_Nandolorian @warriors Interesting I just thought he kept it low-key. It's good for Klay to come back strong and it's even better for him to be able to talk to someone who knows a thing or two about seriously injuries. Sean can give the advice that he needs on what he needs to do to come back strong.@Arautodamassa o glorioso golden state warriors@Arautodamassa Golden State Warriors@warriors @Freddd2k In what universe@findgg33 @KlayThompson @warriors He’s a horse@GodlLotus @warriors I was thinking David West too.@Johnneezy @warriors Oh wow I did not know that.

He’s fantastic!@Stake Golden state warriors 😏@YC_0015 @warriors @TISSOT Personally, I think Steph is mentally drained from all the hoopla of his record. He's had too many "off nights" to be normal.

We'll see the Golden showers in the playoffs!!@andrewbogut @warriors @WarriorsPR Dude...you were the wind of change in Warrior culture. ❤So my man @TheJacobLintner thinks the @memgrizz can be in the finals this year. The @warriors are getting Scarier by the day. So I think we will see the @chicagobulls vs @warriors which would be a great storyline because of Steve Kerr. Or we will see the @nets vs the @jazz.At least five former San Antonio assistants and players under the sure-fire Hall of Famer became head coaches without head coaching experience, including Milwaukee Bucks coach Mike Budenholzer, Golden State Warriors coach Steve Kerr,@Jeopardy @warriors This show is getting retarded &amp; boring now.

You have a totally different starting lineup dynamic with Bane &gt; Kyle and JJJ &gt; scrubs at the 4, it's why you guys still played well without Ja Morant, it's not about 1 center@warriors Am I tripping or is that Shaun Livingston in the back? (On the Klay Thompson pick in the red hoodie). Haven't heard from him in a while if it is him. He's been really low-key since he retired. https://t.co/zSnO8OUl7r@warriors We could tell that JTA was practicing his free throws.@amar08327117 @dallasmavs @swish41 @warriors Wtf does that have to do with dirk@offcialj0nn @warriors Ratio then@AdmireIIII @warriors You fell off@Blazersplzwin @Dame_Carrying Cmon now man stop it. A healthy golden state are easily contenders. Us blazer fans have no room to talk shit about the warriors let alone about first round exits lol.@Viscous_cree @MikeGrabman @Jumpshot8 @JohnEhrenfeld @NBA @Suns @warriors @Bulls @nets @Bucks @memgrizz Adams is a better fit for a younger Grizzlies team, seals out guys for easy lanes to the basket. Doesn’t take up silly shots, JV isn’t that guy pal. For the grizzlies anyways, we’re doing pretty good without him.@warriors Show footage@warriors ik y’all see Shaun Livingston in the back😳Also who is she??? She is amazing!!! @NBA @NBAonTNT @warriors @chicagobulls @StephenCurry30 @UnderArmour@warriors Yoo is that Sean Livingston in the back@Zazuceee @MikeGrabman @Jumpshot8 @JohnEhrenfeld @NBA @Suns @warriors @Bulls @nets @Bucks @memgrizz They had virtually identical offensive rebounding numbers, they are literally 0.2 assists per game difference for their career, 0.5 per game difference this year on a MEM team with a faster pace, and they bully guys all over the paint@warriors OH HI KLAY@warriors I follow back all Curry lovers and Warriors fans@warriors Make curry do some shooting drills@sateIlitex @warriors dm for life@warriors Warriors rn 🔥🔥 https://t.co/vtguTNM4St@warriors i miss klay@warriors W thenreps on reps on reps https://t.co/Gov40xbXqC@Zazuceee @MikeGrabman @Jumpshot8 @JohnEhrenfeld @NBA @Suns @warriors @Bulls @nets @Bucks @memgrizz Bro he shot 12 a game last year wtf are you talking about 18-20 😂😂😂😂

You can't just make up stats to make your argument sound better@Viscous_cree @MikeGrabman @Jumpshot8 @JohnEhrenfeld @NBA @Suns @warriors @Bulls @nets @Bucks @memgrizz They do play drastically different. What are you seeing that I’m not? 🤣@dallasmavs @swish41 @warriors Will the team be carrying a stream or only on Bally?The Golden State Warriors are trading Luka Doncic to the Spurs for a 2020 first-round pick.@Zazuceee @MikeGrabman @Jumpshot8 @JohnEhrenfeld @NBA @Suns @warriors @Bulls @nets @Bucks @memgrizz Jonas had 4.1 offensive rebounds with the Grizzlies last year and Adams has a whopping 4.3 this year lmao

Stop making it sound like they play drastically different dude@dallasmavs @swish41 @warriors Are we playing in our statement jerseys??? https://t.co/K1oWOZF6mxJoin us tomorrow as we honor the GOAT, @swish41.

Catch the ceremony after our 6:30PM CT game vs. the @warriors!@GP2Stan @WashedClarkson @Trxzkiller @warriors How can you be a Warriors fan and talk shit on who's on our team. Foh@ThingsBBNLikes we could lose to the Golden State Warriors by 2 in the last seconds and the “Cal can’t coach” goobers will still crow.@Viscous_cree @MikeGrabman @Jumpshot8 @JohnEhrenfeld @NBA @Suns @warriors @Bulls @nets @Bucks @memgrizz On top of that Adams is offering better offensive rebounding and defence. JV putting up numbers as the second scoring option on a team who won’t make the playoffs.@NBAdabad Phoenix Suns, Golden State Warriors, Brooklyn Nets, Chicago Bulls e Jazz@Viscous_cree @MikeGrabman @Jumpshot8 @JohnEhrenfeld @NBA @Suns @warriors @Bulls @nets @Bucks @memgrizz No I don’t, JV usage rate will hurt the Grizzlies. He’s putting up 18-20 shots a game where Adams is putting up around 5-6. That will then take the ball out of Bane, Morant and J3 hands. Pelicans for sure didn’t win the trade, they are 2nd last in a weak West conference. Lmao@warriors this is trouble 🤣🤣🤣 imagine if most of your player is like this 🌋@warriors Logo Wiggins in game 🤔@RachadAkobi @warriors @Oracle He was a part of the reason they weren’t as good last year. New guys they brought in really fit the team so much betterAnyone else got the feeling that @warriors are intentionally keeping a lid on the James Wiseman return hype? 

I have a feeling he comes back a really different and improved player… @GSWReddit, thoughts?Omo nets are winning it all if kyrie comes back 

I love the golden state warriors but kd x   harden x kyrie joining forces 🤯@elibt @Jeopardy @warriors So difficult to watch when Ken is hosting.

PS: i'm a warriors fan btw! https://t.co/UDGSULXU2H@warriors go go go@warriors It's hard to measure how important he is, but he's a huge part of their improvement this year. I remember Kerr saying once that whenever they had an in-team scrimmage, whichever side Andre was on usually won.@RachadAkobi @warriors @Oracle He didn't "leave" (an assumption that he had a choice), he was on a 1 year contract. 

He was not offered the same amount of money to return to GS. He did get the same amount of money (a tad more) from the Lakers.
