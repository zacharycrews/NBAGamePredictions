I analyze the Nets rookies performances and how they are the present AND the future for Brooklyn basketball.

My latest for @NetsRepublic: https://t.co/qv4Gix2FDHKyrie Irving will need "closer to two weeks" from the time he regularly joins Brooklyn's practices to be game-ready, Nets coach Steve Nash said today.

Also notable: Watched Nash in a @SportsCenter clip narrated by former #USMNT striker-turned-SC host @TaylorTwellman. Impressive!I understand citing the 2018-19 Brooklyn Nets as the example of why the Knicks need to form a winning franchise. But the timing of key FAs saved them from needing to repeat the performance. Are we sure the Nets wouldn't have the same disappointing start the Knicks are having now? https://t.co/oqGxRplmBUWhen asked about Lakers G Russell Westbrook’s tough shooting night against the Brooklyn Nets on Christmas, Lakers’ superstar LeBron James alluded to Westbrooks’ endless effort on the court. https://t.co/qmIGII30ckATS COVERS
