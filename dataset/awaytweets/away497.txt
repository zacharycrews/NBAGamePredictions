I analyze the Nets rookies performances and how they are the present AND the future for Brooklyn basketball.

My latest for @NetsRepublic: https://t.co/qv4Gix2FDHKyrie Irving will need "closer to two weeks" from the time he regularly joins Brooklyn's practices to be game-ready, Nets coach Steve Nash said today.

Also notable: Watched Nash in a @SportsCenter clip narrated by former #USMNT striker-turned-SC host @TaylorTwellman. Impressive!I understand citing the 2018-19 Brooklyn Nets as the example of why the Knicks need to form a winning franchise. But the timing of key FAs saved them from needing to repeat the performance.
