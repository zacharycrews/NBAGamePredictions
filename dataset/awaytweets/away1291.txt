PSN: Russ_isthegoat3Mavs held the Suns to 94 points, Phoenix's lowest point total of the year (regular or postseason).

After shooting a franchise postseason record 64.5% from the field in game two, the Suns failed to shoot over 50% in these playoffs for the first time (44.7%) @FOX4@Pander952 @Suns It’s not a sham. Some important names are in there and they shouldn’t be discredited… BUT it needs to feel more important and made into a massive deal.

He knew the Suns ‘2Up Special’ action &amp; specifically called out when Dallas ran something Phoenix normally run. https://t.co/Womc1NeVff@NBA @Suns @dallasmavs Booker put on the first thing he saw 😭😭order of the phoenix suns💥 NBA MAX PLAY 💥

🏀 Phoenix Suns -2

An uncharacteristically bad game for the Suns &amp; specifically CP3 led to Dallas taking game 3. I expect that to change &amp; for him to play much more efficiently, which will result in them going back to Footprint Center w/ a 2 game lead

🔊Hey smart speaker, play ESPN 1320  
📲 @Audacy app https://t.co/3l7iUfa8qxOff today but my best bet would’ve been Phoenix -1.5 series -142.

Don’t see Dallas winning 2 more. Got 28 from Brunson, 4 3s from DFS/Bullock, outlier bad 2% and TOs by Suns esp CP3, and still only just got over the line with a W.

Don’t really see how Mavs win 2 more times.Good morning Suns fans! Phoenix looks to take a commanding 3-1 series lead this afternoon before they head back to the Valley for Game 5.

We get it Phoenix, it’s hot there, but it’s only one Sun hot.@Suns I pray your warmup shirts read: @WeAreBG@Jumpshot8 @Suns @Suns  are going to clean it up and leave Dallas with a W today.

#NBAPlayoffs https://t.co/GcDbAOUbGVPhoenix Suns -2 (-115) before Friday the Mavs had not beaten the Suns since 2019. 10 straight L’s. CP3 had his worst game of the postseason and Suns turned it over 17 times. I refuse to believe that happens again. CP3, Book and Ayton go off tonight. Suns win big #NBAPlayoffs@luckyg78 @henryfangool @divided728 @dallasmavs @Suns Ok hollie I see you!! You understood what I was trying to do tho.. the booty pic is too far down in my camera roll. I have no idea where it is 😩Early @Suns game today which I'm happy about. I believe PHX will fix their turnover issue in game 3 and they should be fine in game 4. Great time to take advantage of the mavs and go up 3-1. #RallyTheValley@nba is rig we all know they want suns and warriors it’s so weird how ja got hurt last night that was good acting and the suns look so different last game against Dallas @Suns @dallasmavs @LetsGoWarriors @memgrizz I wouldn’t be surprised suns blow out the Mavericks tonightPhoenix SunsReally feel bad for the @sixers fans, but at least Harden is what, 1-13 vs. Scott Foster. So maybe. @CP3 is 0-14. So very happy the @Suns dodged that bullet. @NBAOfficial, when so many Suns and Sixers fans are checking referee assignments each game, you might have a problem.21:00 / Real Madrid - Atleti
