https://t.co/go50iSlnIe@MalcomRiley22 @rdshah @GillamRashaam @DanGoodwinIII MJ always took the losses on his shoulders show me an example of him blaming teammates or saying he did all he could... Look at 95 playoff loss to the Shaq n Penny Magic, MJ took all the blame. What happened in 96? Chip, swept Orlando in ECF, and won 72 gamesI still think ultimately that guy for the Magic is in the league now.
