I guess with WCJr on such a team friendly contract he can be a backup if necessary, and maybe they’ll play together who knows. Wonder how Isaac will be next year. Hope he gets 100%, always liked him.@YoungBoyReturn @30likeimgifted @NiMekhi @OrlandoMagic I’m a Pistons fan and I have no idea if I want them to get #1 pick or not. I mean I do, obv at least want them to get T3 pick, but there’s no seemingly super obvious star. Early on I was high on Paolo and low on Chet, now it’s the opposite. Weird draft. Should be interesting.@JohnnyH004 @gswforIife @OrlandoMagic all from the 60sHasil NBA: Milwaukee Bucks Seruduk Chicago Bulls, Orlando Magic Hajar Warriors #news  #sport #jadicepatpaham https://t.co/4tsWhHcX0jOrlando Magic +8.5 ✅

“We're playing soft, we’re playing stupid. We're just not playing good basketball and we're getting punked. No disrespect to the Orlando Magic but that's one of the worst teams in the league.”

(H/T @anthonyVslater) https://t.co/y4IIkbn0qnWhy do the Orlando Magic get more coverage than the raps 😭😭😭@Qdwag94 @BleacherReport @anthonyVslater My thoughts exactly. The classy way to say that is “No disrespect to the Orlando Magic, but they have one of the worst records in the league.” Saying we’re one of the worst teams just feels like bad sportsmanship.Did Draymond Green forget that the Warriors were 15-50 in 2020 with the same talent as the Orlando Magic? https://t.co/06a2IkfonEThis is a little late, but my phone was low on battery but... THE @OrlandoMagic WON DURING MY FIRST EVER TIME THERE!!!Encerrado:

How dare y’all say anyone is more valuable than Stephen Curry? GS had a top 2 record most of the season. But you know he shot like Dame instead of himself part of the yr so somehow he was less valuable.@OrlandoMagic @warriorsworld draymond is right, we are getting punked 😭Mo Bamba hit a go-ahead 3-pointer with 52.2 seconds left and the host Orlando Magic handed the Golden State Warriors their third straight loss with a 94-90 comeback victory on Tuesday night.

https://t.co/PeseVYpGcMMy prediction that Poole would hang 40 on Orlando was a bad call (he scored 26), but my claim that the Warriors would be mostly ok for a couple weeks without Steph is looking idiotic. Held to 90 points by the Magic? Wow. Only OKC has scored fewer (85) in a game vs ORL this seasonWe beat the Warriors😂 Let’s go @OrlandoMagicBLOWOUT WINNERS💰💰

And btw, without the @OfficialNBARefs tonight, you were smoked. #GSWvsORL #DubNationWe all know how valuable Steph is, but if this team can’t close out a game vs the Orlando Magic without him, how strong is our roster? 

It doesn’t help that we have an incompetent coach. It’s looking like Curry is gonna have to carry for us to even get out the 2nd round.@warriors Any chance I can get an open tryout? Having 6 guys with 2 points or less on your team with game minutes AND dropping a 13 point lead to the @OrlandoMagic (53 loss team) is not the definition of “locked in” #helpisontheway@30likeimgifted @YoungBoyReturn @NiMekhi @OrlandoMagic That's so fucking stupid. That's like me saying in 2009 that curry isn't going to help your team by drafting him. https://t.co/AC0ax1vmwf@NBA @warriors @OrlandoMagic Dude literally told the @memgrizz not to draft him. Lmao thanks for the tip my guy.@NBA @warriors @OrlandoMagic Golden state with no curry, No KD,

The Dubs are shooting 36.6% and are 2-14 from three.@warriors cmonn its just orlando magic@LKas1113 @OrlandoMagic @Vikings @athielen19 Whose winning the game@andre @ElysiumGY @OrlandoMagic Bro we need some momentum going to the playoffs. We call you a swiss army knife for a reason.. u can't sit the whole year and be sharp for the playoffs.Half-joking (Draymond IS overrated tho) but watch how Draymond plays w/o Steph in the line-up

GSW become the Orlando Magic real quick when KD left &amp; Steph is hurt

That 2019-20 season was a Draymond-centered season b/c KD was gone, Steph &amp; Klay were hurt
15-50 https://t.co/HqpKSCeDg1 https://t.co/IG8mim7jvA@EVRYDAYCarter @RyanBarnhart0 @ORL_EGW @andre @OrlandoMagic Lol you hard up behind Orlando🤣 I didn’t say they was gon lose 🤡🤡 l losers@OrlandoMagic @Vikings @athielen19 Tell him to leave real fan could’ve had that seatwe are losing to the orlando magic 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂@ORL_EGW @EVRYDAYCarter @RyanBarnhart0 @andre @OrlandoMagic Okay and Orlando had their bench in Up by like 12.

Nets are 0-1 against the warriors. The warriors are 2-7 without Steph this year and are currently down 10 to the Orlando Magic. Steph is just way better than your favorite playerEvery shot they're taking on the outside has been heavily contested. 

Every shot in the interior is either not taken or they're turning it over on the other end
