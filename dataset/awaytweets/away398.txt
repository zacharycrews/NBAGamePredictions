Both offer the same thing for a team. Lavine isnt a game changer either and the bulls built around his scoring.

Green has potential as well. But lavine started off being dangerous as a scorer. Injuries made the timbs forget about him. Now the bulls are building around him. Be humble. Your rockets have way to go@FrankieHoxha @PJuggler46 @RobloxJeffSteel @ClutchCityENTX @BrooklynNets lmao what the fuck are you even saying dude? if we all knew who'd be a great pro as they enter the league then busts wouldn't exist. obviously isn't the case though. and some players breakout later than others...@BryantBurnsRed @PJuggler46 @RobloxJeffSteel @ClutchCityENTX @BrooklynNets Dont tell me otherwise il believe it when i see it. You know when someone will be great when they enter the league. But if you think rockets needed to draft someone like green on their first pick your out your fucking mind.@FrankieHoxha @PJuggler46 @RobloxJeffSteel @ClutchCityENTX @BrooklynNets He'll end up being Zach Lavine level or better.@FrankieHoxha @PJuggler46 @RobloxJeffSteel @ClutchCityENTX @BrooklynNets You don't know shit about me Frankie, but keep talking out the side of your neck. And talking about how athletic you are (you say athletic, I say small)  and how much you "fuck" you come off insecure as shit. It's cool though, if you say it enough you might start to believe it.@BryantBurnsRed @PJuggler46 @RobloxJeffSteel @ClutchCityENTX @BrooklynNets Green is not the answer for a struggling rockets team. Hes clearly not a game changing type of player. If his shots dont go in then what else does he provide? Hes gonna end up being just a shooter and a hypeman for his dunks.@BryantBurnsRed @PJuggler46 @RobloxJeffSteel @ClutchCityENTX @BrooklynNets Your literally mad cuz i stated facts. And your here to tell me what? That green wasnt a factor in the loses? That theis was the only reason? Lmao. Green is a rook trying to prove hes a 1st round pick to the world. And hes not looking like he can bring much to the table.@BryantBurnsRed @PJuggler46 @RobloxJeffSteel @ClutchCityENTX @BrooklynNets Your pic that you changed of course.
