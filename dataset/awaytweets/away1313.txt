And I’ve already said I don’t support the banning of guns. I only support the banning of assault type weapons.Following the announcement of the All-NBA teams that excluded MVP runner-up @JoelEmbiid from the First Team selection, @celtics superstar @jaytatum0 came to the defense of the @sixers superstar.
