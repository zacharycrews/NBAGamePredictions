https://t.co/4L9ErDTU5USometimes I think we're being a little too hard on these NFL GMs for intentionally wanting to tank. I mean, the Oklahoma City Thunder just brought up Lindy Waters and the Chiefs had Matt Cassell start 47 games in the late 2000s. 😆 🤣The Oklahoma City Thunder signed Lindy Waters III to a two-way contract.I can’t wait for the Oklahoma City Thunder to beat the 76ers outright tomorrow. ☕️@LaurenceWHolmes @Ecnerwal23 Which professional sports team fanbase has the worst experience right now:
