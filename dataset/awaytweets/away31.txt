I'll just stick to watching the Milwaukee Bucks #FearTheDeer that Giannis Antetokounmpo and Middleton partnership 🤌was having a bad day when i realized that the milwaukee bucks are one of the least dysfunctional and unproblematic teams in the nba 😌😌😌@MJS_23 @Bucks Recency bias in effectA mini-thread of plays that stood out to me during the Miami Heat's W against the Milwaukee Bucks yesterday:

First, a microcosm of how the game would go:

Giannis gets the mismatch vs. Kyle in the post
Lowry strips him
Bam leads transition
Pat C flops
💪 leads to the easy two https://t.co/8eRuogUw7Pchelsea, milwaukee bucks, brazil https://t.co/q8iBzhCYXO@Bucks coulda left payton off tbh@Bucksn666 @Bucks You aren't alone ...
