Collab with @RussCashes 

Jazz stole their last game at home, or else this series should’ve been wrapped up right then and there. Mavs have two games under their legs now with Luka, and with Donovan hurt, this should be SERIES.

Let’s get rich. https://t.co/BxaUslQwUc@JustCore__ @dallasmavs Lol im not a fan of both but i sure do want jazz to pull throughI think one of the reasons that Utah has struggled to beat this Dallas Mavericks team is because you have to play like a team to beat them, something we've struggled with this year. Donovan is not going to hang up 45 on Finney Smith, if they play like a team they will win@jga41agher @dallasmavs Gossling dies at the end of that one 🤷🏼‍♂️OK maybe not in Mavs-Jazz.

1u - Dallas Mavericks ML (-110 DK)

The Jazz aren’t at full health and have struggled mightily to defend Dallas on the perimeter. Luka &amp; Brunson will have mismatches regardless of who’s covering them. Conley &amp; Bojan trending down.

They should go ahead &amp; let you run the @dallasmavs page. 🤔Let’s stop the talk about the @warriors being the Western favorite. It’s the @dallasmavs - and @getnickwright will tell you that tomorrow.Why does Twitter suddenly think I’m into sports? Who are the Warriors? What is the purpose of a mock draft? What’s all of this about?

Twitter, if you read this, I only really care about the Dallas Mavericks and Figure Skating.MLB: @Dodgers 
NFL: @MiamiDolphins 
NBA: @dallasmavs 
MLS: @LAFC as long as Vela’s there.
NHL: @EdmontonOilers but really wherever Connor McDavid happens to play.
CFB: @CanesFootball https://t.co/n7zlnJbFRn@morganprice You can't be tweeting about your love hate relationship with local teams and then not be shocked when the final local team loses. Real quick, what's your stance on the @dallasmavs?In the first 6 seconds of the shot clock  the Utah Jazz are shooting 4 of 18 from 3 and the Dallas Mavericks are shooting 12 of 23 from 3

First 8 seconds of shot clock Jazz are 9 of 44 from 3 and Dallas is 15 of 32 from 3.  

Jazz are 5 of 26 in from 16-17 on shot clockCall me crazy, Call me delusional, but I have a feeling the #Dallas #Mavericks will land a big #freeagent this summer. Mark My words.I would like to announce Dallas Mavericks Guard Jalen Brunson has welcomed a new son in the last week . Congrats on being a father . @jalenbrunson1 #mffl #Mavericks #dallas #dALLasIN https://t.co/CGT8vEHDMl@DallasStars lost but made playoffs, @Rangers lost and are now 6-12, @dallasmavs play tomorrow but I have high hopes for them. #TexasHockey #MLB Love my teams but 2/3 gotta step it up and it ain’t the Mavs. #NBAPlayoffs@mcuban Apparently it’s easy for the @dallasmavs and @NBA to ignore Chinese genocide, but that’s not health and safety issue I guess @mcubanIs Dallas a Cowboys town or Mavericks town? #DallasCowboys #MFFLWe Got Stars &amp; Mavs In The Playoffs! @dallasmavs @DallasStars 🟢🟢🔵⚫️Dallas Mavericks: ‘Same Approach’: Mavs Staying Focused Ahead of Game 6 vs. Jazz https://t.co/dYXXkctdkpAllow me to say this for the 2nd week in a row, regarding as many dallas franchises:

The context of each game matters so much more in the playoffs. Just watch the games and enjoy my friend.Tomorrow, we go to war @dallasmavsTeddy Covers

5%- Dallas Mavericks +1.0 (-110)@BabeLaufenberg Dallas pro sports franchises have had worse drafts. Mavericks had the 8th, 16th, &amp; 17th picks in the 1985 NBA Draft and drafted Detlef Schrempf, Uwe Blab and Bill Wennington when they could have selected Karl Malone, Joe Dumars, and A.C. Green.Utah Jazz star Donovan Mitchell 'good to go' for Game 6 vs. Dallas #Mavericks - ABC News https://t.co/3vxQQUV9qbMy friend in Dallas offered his courtside seats to Jazz at Mavericks on Saturday if the Jazz can force a game 7 by winning game 6 at home on Thursday. 

Please Jazz. You can do it!
