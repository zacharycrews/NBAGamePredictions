https://t.co/vk5NH6RGTRI don’t understand @Suns why I have to read about #deandreayton leaving in the off season. As a suns fan, I would be upset white frankly if we didn’t give him what he wants so we can have him during his prime….. 🤦🏻‍♂️This gif is an accurate representation of the @Suns @Timberwolves game last night. 

TOO SOON, JUNIOR. https://t.co/IQI7GU37GpBooker, Ayton, and Bridges need to stay on the @Suns .  Not extending Ayton is a disgrace and if we lose him our chance at a title will fall dramatically.Deandre Ayton scored a career-high 35 points as the Phoenix Suns fought back to beat the Minnesota Timberwolves 125-116 for their sixth straight win.

Booker is one of only six players in NBA history to record a 70-point game, and he is the youngest to do so by more than three years. https://t.co/zE3aKQYGKR@BuuVanNygren @DakotaStandard I lived in Phoenix for many years and I remember the moment I heard of her death.

I pray that her children are doing well.@mikedonnelly555 @Suns @landryshamet @campayne @TargetCenterMN You say divided ..

The mvp stands out. Always has. The mvp plays the best basketball that year. That's usually the case.

That has turned into an excellent deal.the Phoenix suns have the innate ability to either blow a significant lead in the second half or dig themselves into a massive hole at halftime against a mediocre opponent and crawl back to win a close game in the second half. there is no in between. being a suns fan is fun.@JaMorant You watching the @suns game too! 👀@ASAP__Sports @cenkuygur @YouTube @NBA @Suns @cenkuygur pointing the finger means don’t look at how he treats his employees 👈👈 https://t.co/pueqevMYvF@Suns These second-straight time in a row. #SunsAreAwesome.@Suns @DeandreAyton Timberwolves cleaning staff seeing this video: https://t.co/4lWNyJWUyzPhoenix Suns are cooking in the NBA right would love to see them vs the grizzlies in the play offsPhoenix suns, Memphis Grizzlies &amp; Celtics are cooking right now Damn.Devin Booker (28 PTS) Rallies Phoenix Suns in Victory Over Minnesota Timberwolves

#NBA@Suns why you gotta do my wolves like that 😤@thatboicrispy @Suns So nice to see😂 My man was talking shit because of one dunkGoodnight @Suns @DevinBook@PlaysOfTheWeek @GusDlaRoca Y los @Suns ?? 🥺@Suns @NBA @DevinBook he’s a future goat I can’t understand how people can’t see thisThis is crazy irony

@DevinBook moved into 323rd place with the @Suns win last night over @Timberwolves

Next on the list at 322? @KarlTowns

KAT: 11008
Book: 11005@Suns He hasn't and doesn't need to be the focus on offense but to hell if he can't be.
If sun's had to use him the way the few other elite big men need to be used to win games for their teams, his ppg and apg would be up by at least 20% and probably closer to 30%.Phoenix Suns vs Minnesota Timberwolves Full Game Replay 2022 Mar 23 NBA Replay HD

It feels like news when that isn't the case.@Suns @DevinBook Towns ph'cked around, and the Twolves found out.The Suns are 9 games better than the next-best team in the NBA.

The last team to finish 9 games or more above the 2nd-place team was the 1991-92 Chicago Bulls.

That's right, the Phoenix Suns are more superior to the rest of the league than any team in the last 30 years.Man, I can't find my Phoenix SUNS hat under all this Lakers stuff.@Suns @DeandreAyton Why doesn’t he do this every fucking game !!!!!@Dame_Lillard @Dame_Lillard you finna be a phoenix sun one day bro we fuck with you@landryshamet @Suns Great game tonight SHAM3T!!@NeeNeeSr15 @TheRealJoeGonzo @VariVlone @IsiahThomas @DevinBook @Suns @NBA Book 25 5 5 Best Record in the NBA 12-4 w/o CP.

If anything, we have still been improving since he went outAnd my @Suns #WinAgain 😎Can someone ask Jae Crowder to score a three point to wrap up the game please @SunsI believe the Phoenix Suns are 11-4 without Chris Paul.@alxocity @Suns @ElDumboTS Kids love alphabet soup@Suns Ayton put an end to the debate between him and KAT. Give me Ayton 10 times out of 10Timberwolves lose at home to the Suns, meaning that they are now 1.5 games behind Denver for the 6-seed with 8 games remaining.

Phoenix is now 59-14 and just one win and one loss by the Grizzlies away from clinching the NBA’s top-seed in the playoffs.Love seeing the @Suns have a good time closing out a team on the visiting teams court.

Phoenix is a well oiled machine. BK has 2 top 15 players but their organization as a whole is a mess right now. Grizzlies have neither the experience or the fire power to match up with the Suns in a 7 game series.Another slow start tonight for @Suns but they’re hitting their stride early in the 4th. 

They seem a little more locked in with greater intensity. 

Coincidence? 
Nah. 

But why wait ‘til the 4th…?

That 2nd quarter officiating was terrible.@Suns how much we pay these refs to call technicals all night lmao? What a joke@ThePurpleBizon Bro, 5 on 8?

Hope he is ok 👍 @SunsThings are getting HEATED at Target Center. You simply love to see it. F the @Suns #Awoo@NBA I'm going to need the address to these refs, asking for a friend... #phoenixsuns... also what's going on the last two weeks with these refs? #hirebetterrefsSuns down 13 after an emotional first half. Playoff-type intensity. Looking forward to Phoenix’s response.@Suns just leave the arena since there’s no point with these refsThese officials know we all tuned in to watch them!!! @Suns and @Wolves are just bonus content #RefYouSuck #ThatsFlagrant #nbaI am flabbergasted at how these shit ass refs are trying to screw the @Suns  out of another game🤦🏻‍♂️ @NBA check your dumbass refs!!!Please explain how you un-call a T. Then call an F1 on a shot. @NBA @Suns@NBA at this point, it's clear your refs are actively calling against the @Suns

You are quite literally the most pathetically reffed league to ever exist. That isn't even directly a suns problem. Even Timberwolves fans were chanting it.

Fucking fix it you asshats@vml_xo @Suns Its a slug fest, Wolves have the refs in their pocket.@Suns I'm not sure when the Suns became public enemy #1 in the officials eyes but this game and last game has been ridiculous@justin83748 @Joesopski @Suns Refs are winning min this game it’s actually funnyWatching @Suns and @Timberwolves game… are these replacement refs? Complete garbage!@Lennyoffill2 @Suns I’m watching the suns miss half their free throws and shoot 5-19 from three… you should criticize what they can control before scrutinizing these refs… they’re not the reason the suns are down 13@Joesopski @Lennyoffill2 @Suns So booker getting tackled out of bounds is a travel? OkI’m having second thoughts on renewing my @Suns season tickets. This is becoming a waste of money with this officiating.Just fly to Denver now @Suns. Just leave.For those of us who have watched the NBA since the Suns/Lakers Playoff series in 1969, I can say that the league does not want the Phoenix franchise to ever win it all, &amp; uses their low-IQ officials to carry out that dictum. https://t.co/Qm5h3RPogsThe officials on this game, right now, do NOT know what they are doing. #ValleyProud @Suns @TimberwolvesYo these .@NBA .@NBARefStats refs for @Suns Minnesota game are trash.
