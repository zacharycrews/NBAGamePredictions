We scared people into locking themselves up. This has ccaused severe anxiety, suicide, massive drug overdose crisis and physical abuse. But yep. Covid we fear and lockdowns keep us safeThe highlight reel dunks didn’t slow down after Vince Carter left the Toronto Raptors. In 2005, “Vinsanity” secured a loose ball, took one dribble, and laid the hammer on Alonzo Mourning, who was no slouch defensively. “VC” had on the Nike Shox VC 5 here. https://t.co/9WGcdDylOTCome check out our basketball singles for rookie cards of current Toronto Raptors players! #dollyssportscards #DollysDowntown @ Chinatown Centre https://t.co/1CO8g4ThwB@Raptors would've won in 2019 without the Kawhi trade.

Try to take away this one from him NBA.  @Raptors #WeTheNorth #NBAAllStarLook at our #SpicyP @pskills43 young vet leading out there, organizing the team to play winning basketball #GROAT would be so proud seeing his pups succeeding   @Raptors #WeTheNorth    CHAvsTOR https://t.co/TJdLVXCzf576-61 Raptors lead at half

Clearly, not a good defensive showing for the Hornets. Having lots of problem with Toronto's size, particularly Siakam (19 PTS); Raptors taking advantage of any double teams with Trent (15) and Anunoby (13) hitting outside shots@irbishi @NBA Yes indeed, that is a bucket list item. For me, it would be to see my Toronto Raptors take on the Knicks at the mecca of all arenas MSG, courtside; see and watch Spike Lee.@KyleBaileyClub @hornets @Raptors Complete horse crap but moving on. What I want to know is why JB refuses to still play Nick. They are attacking the paint on every play for layups and kick outs. Nick is a legit big body shot blocker who can help. Why not play him?So we can go 10 deep #raptors #torontoraptors #NBAIt's been a while @Raptors #tangerinefanangle #WeTheNorth https://t.co/UMPpmR6jJWGreat first half! Please keep it up @RaptorsWhoever is running the clock at the @Raptors game must be drunk, they keep missing points and adding points!!!! YOU HAVE ONE JOB!Siakim has two fouls for getting ball..... @nba @raptors@topshotmyck @nbatopshot @Raptors I guess thats a fair point. I only completed about a month ago so my perception of them in challenges might be off a bit#tangerinefanangle #torontoraptors #raptors Let’s go Raptors! Woof woof! https://t.co/oEZ9Rk7GBsPut the @raptors in a cryo chamber between halves. They’re getting battered every play. #WeTheNorthThis is VanVleet's team, and he is an absolutely wonderful player in his own right (a deserving all-star!), but make no mistake: Pascal Siakam is the Toronto Raptors' best player.@Raptors doing the stinging tonight!

#tangerinefanangle #wethenorth https://t.co/poJXKChxUD@ThePointAfterFF @nbatopshot @Raptors Yes but we weren’t seriously included in flash challenges until about 3 weeks ago. But every time our game falls on a flash challenge night, there’s always a Raptor@irbishi @NBA Whenever you are in Toronto, let me know. Will hook you up with good raptors seats.Blue shares how I am feeling about the reffing in the first half of the @Raptors game…! https://t.co/Tyd4BHHRcJ@_itsmarkymark @OfficialNBARefs @NBA @Raptors It’s getting worseWatching Charlotte vs Toronto game on Ballys
