@MiamiHEAT | #HEATCulture https://t.co/xgMxaNwtfv@MiamiHEAT @DoorDash Yes. Sticking with strus! Hopefully he plays better tonight but still better than Duncan. Hopefully spo does the same thing bringing Tyler in early and staggeringly butler's minutes again.@MiamiHEAT I count 10 🔥@MiamiHEAT 9 or 10. one didnt show@MiamiHEAT Doesn’t matter . While it’s a luxury for him and Jimmy to be able to hit 3’s they Ake the team is better when they are attacking the basket .@MiamiHEAT @DoorDash Most important game of all 82 this regular season

We are very fortunate Bos is without Williams a DPOY candidate and their 2nd most valuable player in ws/48 + VORP

Much better spot for Miami. They lost to Toronto in a 3 OT game before playing Boston the last time and beat Dallas by 15 before losing again to Boston.

Both big letdown spots for Miami@bookie_blitz @MiamiHEAT Celtics Cover. Defense too tough.@DaCosmicPug @celtics @MiamiHEAT @NBCSBoston @espn @985TheSportsHub Ok thanksNuggets ML and Heat +8.5 (-119)

Alternate spread. Miami is 15-6 ATS as dog. They are 0-2 ATS, ML vs BOS this year.

Not a revenge angle, but much better schedule spot to back Heat this time. Heat lost 3 OT game and won by 15 in two games prior to playing C’s.

We’re 45 minutes from tip-off for a matchup between the two of the Eastern Conference’s best. The Celtics (47-29) are set to take on the Heat (48-28). Boston has won the previous two matchups against Miami by a combined 47 points.

Should have another good game in the East with Miami in Boston. The Heat certainly want to keep their 1st place ranking and the Celtics are going to try and prove they are for real, currently sitting in fourth. 5 points feels like a lot for two top teams.

This game is huge for the eastern conference standings and without Robert Willams playing for the Celtics this spread is simply to large.

And can’t wait to see more of Pat Riley’s role in the upcoming episodes of Winning Time on HBO Max 🔥🔥a sample size glance back at how the culture came to be along the way@Dantayman I agree with what your saying kinda. This is different because a lot of times coaches are scared to lose their job if the star player dislikes them or etc, but with the Miami Heat it’s different because we know Spo ain’t going no where so they’ll fix it and move on@MiamiHEAT @FTX_Official -10 way too easy@MrH_1012 @MiamiHEAT @FTX_Official Numbers look good but you fucked up on the last oneA look back at what it took for the Heat to land Pat Riley #miamiheat https://t.co/0IfEgUgmfY@Undefined003 @santiii250 @Max_B_Shepherd @Apollo24zZ @stickybunnn @NBA @MiamiHEAT Same thing can be said about Turkish DrummondProbably won’t see any or much of the game today, so please attempt victory @MiamiHEAT.@hoodieskeenasz @CalebYoung_10 @_KoBean_ Nah Bron got out of the first round.
