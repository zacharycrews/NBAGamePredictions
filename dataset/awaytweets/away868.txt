Jordan defended Detroit's perimeter players. It's harder to rebound when you're on the perimeter. None of Detroit's guards outrebounded Jordan.

On offense, Jordan was routinely doubled and tripled Games 4-6.

Pistons had a bigger, deeper, tougher front line. https://t.co/Tjd8j0V2pg https://t.co/v5ZVYsbmae@DelawareBlogger @SaddiqBey @DetroitPistons Damn. He has a cousin name Malik?

That would leave Boston with only 11 players on the second night of a back-to-back, with travel.

You don't want to waste a 10-day going into the ASB, but this isn't great.@bigdogpistons I‚Äôm sure teams had offers, but they weren‚Äôt for Detroit Jerami. I seriously feel like everybody wins if he takes a step back offensively.

He gets to a competitive team, Pistons get trade value, our youth gets more offensive opportunity.@vaughtsviews EVERY team is going to see how LSU, Texas A&amp;M, Vandy, UF, &amp; now Tenn muck up a game + resort to Detroit Pistons from the 90s. A huge Achilles heel if Oscar and others can't keep their composure / play thru what I hate to refer to _HUG basketball.
