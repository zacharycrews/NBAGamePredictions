Not mentioning serge and hill who plays great in the playoffs@Gavan262 @nunyabizboy @Bucks @WisconsinHerd Last playoffs we had a full defensive player on PJ. Guards that played the most were Donte, Forbes and Pat.
We lost firepower from Donte and Forbes, added with Grayson. We need more. We are great on def with Serge, BP, Brook, Pat and Jrue specially. Pointless to have Jevon.@bucksln6lx @nunyabizboy @Bucks @WisconsinHerd Well, we had Cousins and waived. Although, I think Bobby and Ibaka fit us very well. Our guard suplents that aren't performing.
It's great to play defense, but there must be an equilibrium. We had a full defensive player last year on PJ, but also fire power with Forbes and Donte.@lvleopard12 @Bucks @WisconsinHerd Gatekeepers unite!@MBurner3000 @Bucks No lol.
Giannis should play why you fake fans instist to rest him all the time? He rested enough already. Jokic barely missed any game.
