Ive heard some look at the 1st round of the play offs or smt before@mkmomin23 @NBATV @sixers @ATLHawks @dallasmavs @Lakers @Bucks thats not why they had less wins through the first 72 games…its because they play down to their competition…no way in hell they have one of the best records against good teams in the league and have the record they have unless they sell hard against inferior competition FACTS💯@CBSSportsNet @AdamSchein @Bucks Yep, that was frustrating…l only 161 more to go.l🙄@MountForPM @logjam17 @Bucks @MotorolaUS It’s a regular season award, the voting is due by next Sunday midnight@Bucks @SociosUSA when Giannis is questionable, it means Giannis plays.. coz for Giannis, the question "you feel like playin tonight?" has only one answer -&gt; "hell yeah".@6ers22champs @WISportsW1 @Bucks @SociosUSA Now u have James Harden with ground up hamstrings, good luck@nosmhsnow @logjam17 @Bucks @MotorolaUS Yeah true its gonna be hard to beat jokic but good to see he has stayed 2nd in voting this week.

Still tho if he wins scoring title and dpoy and gets through the first few rounds of the play offs and jokic goes out the 1st round before the mvp is announced he has a chance@Bucks Is l vildoza playing today?Update on the @Bucks auction with tons of great packages up for grabs!

So excited to see him and what his role is for the Bucks. Because he can do a little bit of everything on the court. Can be a very solid bench player.@Bucks Ratio by 🇦🇷@adam_wildt44 @Bucks lol I’m Happy you feel accomplished for beating a g league team.

What’re you talking about, we had an open roster spot so we decided to fill it. The bench shrinks come playoff time and Bobby, Grayson, and Pat will be the only bench players seeing minutes in big gamesI don’t except him to get rotational minutes for the Bucks, but he’s definitely a fun player and I’m glad he’s here.

Pointless to have Jevon.@bucksln6lx @nunyabizboy @Bucks @WisconsinHerd Well, we had Cousins and waived. Although, I think Bobby and Ibaka fit us very well. Our guard suplents that aren't performing.
It's great to play defense, but there must be an equilibrium. We had a full defensive player last year on PJ, but also fire power with Forbes and Donte.@lvleopard12 @Bucks @WisconsinHerd Gatekeepers unite!@MBurner3000 @Bucks No lol.

He's exactly what we needed last year to defend them in the paint..@TimothyS1977 @saladxn @NBAonTNT @Bucks @Gatorade Go to the Celtics Twitter page and you’ll see how your fellow fans is in agreement that the Celtics lost on purpose in hopes to play the Bulls first round instead of the Nets.@celtics That game just said that the Bucks are not a threat.

Super tough draw for both teams so early in the playoffs. The Nets might need Ben Simmons in some capacity to pull it out.Giannis Antetokounmpo and Jrue Holiday each scored 29 points and the Milwaukee Bucks edged the short-handed Boston Celtics 127-121 to take over second place in the Eastern Conference standings.
