Ben as a small ball 5 had unconvincing returns on defense in Philadelphia, however with increased reps and the benefit of KD as a help defender, it could work out better in Brooklyn. Ben really shines on the perimeter however which is where you would want him on D.Nets (2/8)

The Nets broke up their big three due to Harden’s impending free agency. Ben Simmons is a huge defensive upgrade for the nets as well as being younger and under contract long term. Brooklyn’s transition offense will be downright scary with their three stars.5th Brooklyn Nets (1/8)

Philadelphia 76ers receive: James Harden and Paul Millsap.

Brooklyn Nets receive: Ben Simmons, Seth Curry, Andre Drummond and two first-round picks.@BrooklynNets @blakegriffin23 @AndreDrummond They both used to be, dunno if they still are 🤷See you on March 10th Brooklyn Nets.@BrooklynNets Wonder why in part the Nets are a star-crossed franchise? @EvanRobertsWFAN@BrooklynNets @sdotcurry @AndreDrummond If Seth can stay Healthy it's a good addThis is the family culture that Sean Marks has preached since arriving to Brooklyn. It’s the little things like this that make players &amp; their families feel welcomed. Great gesture by the Nets. https://t.co/tppoGYHuqP@Molly_Hot_Takes @BrooklynNets Yeah but he's not our second best player and we don't need his shooting.

It's a good move for Philly. The way Joel is playing right now will surely attract more defense especially when playoffs arrived. He will need another co-star that is consistent on scoring and can make plays for others.@4LokoDorado @Styles510D @BrooklynNets @HSpecialSurgery Because he hasn’t played in a long time and will need time to ramp up his conditioning and if he come backs too quick it will make him look bad cause he used mental health as an excuse@notjmorant @James_S547 @BrooklynNets @SteveNash @sdotcurry Lmao we say this every szn don't get ur hopes upD.J.

The @BrooklynNets won that trade over @sixers with a 3 to 1 punch.

This post-season will be fun!Brooklyn Nets’ Kevin Durant doing on-court work, getting closer to return https://t.co/mww174ZpC5@Arun30384 @JayLGK @BrooklynNets LeBron also gave in during 2016 and they won a chip with KyrieFor all the atrocities Brooklyn Nets has put me through these past months, a Chelsea club World Cup win will be great for me 🥺@IssaHenry92 @BrooklynNets He can’t shoot a standard NBA Jumpshot.  What if he gets fouled in the 4th quarter and teams force him to the line.  You need to make those shootsI can’t help but think Brooklyn missed an opportunity to further improve their team at the deadline. They could have flipped the draft picks to a third team and taken back more salary. Imagine the Nets with Myles Turner instead of Drummond. A much better fit on a Simmons team.@LibertyLinePHL @BrooklynNets Yeah,he could b like Giannis.Right after he goes 2 see the Wizard 4 his trifecta of missing traits
1st,2 get "ccc-courraage" 2 take a clutch shot.

@ebll_tv @JediOzman @Kobratakibii 
Not bad in my opinion because they lost nearly nothing and got superstar.Telling you right now Ben Simmons IMO is exactly what Brooklyn Nets need. A very good defensively minded player.

They definitely got the better end of the deal offloading a 32-year-old James Harden, short term he’ll improve the 76ers for sure but not a good long investment

Big win cuz Harden makes Philly's offense more Dynamic, and relieves pressure off Embiid by - seeing less double teams &amp; more options for Embiid on the move. Harden's defense is shored up by Thybulle &amp; Embiid

It was a good move because they traded away an asset that wasn’t valuable at all to them because he wouldn’t play and they got to keep Harris and maxey the draft picks where steep

Yes it is. Adding James Harden to a contending roster with basically just losing Seth is a good move. They didn't lost Harris, Maxey or Thybulle so yes, it's definitely a WIN!!💯

 #Brooklyn_NetsThe Brooklyn Nets really tryin win a Ring fr frKendrick Perkins really stunned Stephen A Smith when he asked him who’s the leader in that Brooklyn Nets locker room?

Stephen A said : “I have no answer for that, you got me  there”@BrooklynNets Patty is such a goat manI need @KyrieIrving to convince Sean Marks to bring @CarisLeVert back to Brooklyn. Trading him for Harden for Harden to quit was a terrible decision.
And have the Nets talk again with the State gov about you resuming full time now that NY mask mandate is over. #BrooklynNets #Nets@sauceygoatdp @CurryTrae @BrooklynNets @sdotcurry @AndreDrummond do you even understand the game of basketball???@BrooklynNets Australia 🇦🇺 is in the building can’t wait to see Ben play #BrooklynNets@BrooklynNets “10” missed post season free throws@BrooklynNets Kyrie also has Australian roots btw@BrooklynNets Kyrie was born in aussie too@BrooklynNets Better than James Washed Harden@BrooklynNets Don’t forget about KyrieMiami Heat vs. Brooklyn Nets

https://t.co/I3OdsIXh2DI'm making sure the @BrooklynNets is safe space for @BenSimmons25 because we know that when players get the mental health they need, not only do players get a little breathing room, but everybody on the team does better.  #mentalhealth #NetsWorld #NBA75@Clint_Bananas @William75238153 @BrooklynNets Dawg you must be forgetting who’s team he’s on now ? KD , Seth Curry , Kyrie (partially) Drummond , Joe Harris (when healthy) Patty mills who’s been going the fck off , what else does he need to do besides play defense and push the fast break ? And get easy ass assists?There are people still defending the @BrooklynNets decision to construct the team with KD, Kyrie, and Harden.

Then again, there are still people saying the south is going to win The Civil War so...push.

#NBAEmbied and Harden is gonna be a pairing that is scary. As a @BrooklynNets fan I think we made the better trade. Simmons is gonna give us that more defensive end too. Excited to see Seth too. We have the GM to trust. Nash needs to step up or be out though. BK we go hard.@BrooklynNets From zero to perfect i reckon :)I saw the Brooklyn Nets yesterday and was in the elevator with a fighter.

KD can't win without a Curry.. so it makes sense to me 🤷‍♂️I know U sixer fans hate Ben for the playoffs last season. But giving him to Brooklyn is the reason why they consider it a bad trade. Along with Seth curry and Drummond. Nets now have 3 of the top shooters in the nba. Ben can be himself here cause we all know stylistically https://t.co/AmWU8TfKSY@EskoN8tiveAK @DeyAlcalde @BrooklynNets @sdotcurry @AndreDrummond Nah at least KD is a professional even when he wanted out of golden state he waited until free agency and played in the finals until he got injured ... Harden was faking injuries to force a trade ..@BrooklynNets puhahahahha ben simmons is number 10 ? I don't think it deserves@BrooklynNets @sdotcurry @AndreDrummond Now please fire Nash and get a coach with some brain!The Brooklyn Nets have acquired guard/forward Ben Simmons, guard Seth Curry, center Andre Drummond and two future first round draft picks from the Philadelphia 76ers in exchange for guard James Harden and forward Paul Millsap.1 day ago@LakerFan4ever87 @BrooklynNets Yea same way you call in sick to work and then all of a sudden you feel alot better not bs rs@TheMiamiHeatUK @BrooklynNets Gonna be there for the first time in over two years.

They both have a similar winning mentality that Harden, Simmons just don't@IssaHenry92 @William75238153 @BrooklynNets Lmao at this guy thinking Ben is going to be offering anything on the offensive side of the court. He may have 5-10 regular season games where that is the case, but he will go missing in the playoffs per his usual routine.@BrooklynNets 10 bricked free throws a game?Hope basketball analyst &amp; fans looking at the 2 #willing defenders @sixers already have with @MatisseThybulle &amp; @DGreen_14🤨which means @JHarden13 can do what he does offensively😱and with the way @BrooklynNets let em go, I wanna see em do what he do come playoff time! #WillHe🤨@MundoEagles @BrooklynNets @WellsFargoCtr I LOVE IT!!!

U got a real shitbag!@TYxREAPER @CrownTheBulls @DortDiplo @LakerFan4ever87 @BrooklynNets You mean after they threw him under the bus, GM tried to trade him but couldn't, blamed him for everything, coach wouldn't back him and entire fan base told him to leave the city... THATs when they decided to pay him a visit? 😂😂😂@clesportsfan41 @LakerFan4ever87 @BrooklynNets He'll yeah and beat Joel's ass😂😂@BrooklynNets @sdotcurry @AndreDrummond When it's ok, no complaint over NBA fans for KD joined with Harden or Kyrie or with Simmons and Kyrie, that's when you come to understand that Steph and Klay are way above those said no substance pretender superstars.@BrooklynNets Haha! Shit is never gonna work. Y'all got 2 ball dominent guards now, like you did before, but worse, cuz 1 can't &amp; won't shoot! How is Kyrie gonna hold the ball the entire time up the court, if Ben Simmons isn't an option to shoot?

In Philly you guys needed Him to shoot. This is a new team
Brooklyn Nets doesn’t need him to shoot. 
We’re looking at height, his passing skills, defensive skills. 
Nets desperately needed big guys plus we got DrummondThe @BrooklynNets made them trade like they moving them packs lmaoThe fact Harden is eligible for free agency was likely a big factor behind his trade from the Nets. Before a deal was made, The Athletic Sam Amick reported the Sixers believed he wouldn't re-sign with the Nets and that they could use that as leverage in negotiations with Brooklyn@BrooklynNets @sdotcurry @AndreDrummond How about Nash? Fire Nash please!@anthonydaoudd @NETSCHIPSZN2022 @PlayboiSimmons Bro, Harden is in decline. It’s not that he is trash but he’s not playing at his best. 
Listen, both teams won the trade cuz of the drama but Philly made Brooklyn Nets better than them. 

Anybody who knows basketball know Philly ain’t gonna be enough to beat this new NetsShams Charania of The Athletic and Stadium reported Harden was planning to opt in with Philly for 2022-23 as part of his trade from the Brooklyn Nets@BrooklynNets @sdotcurry @AndreDrummond where’s simmons ? still battling with mental issues?@GlobalWealthCel @BrooklynNets Nets---&gt;finalsWatch out!!

So him starting to play again right after trading doesn’t mean he was foul imo@DDSportsTalk @Arun30384 @JayLGK @Rob24282840 @BrooklynNets You rate it by hmm if my team were to face them could we actually lose.

Say you don’t watch the Brooklyn nets without saying you don’t watch the Brooklyn nets 🤣🤣 no chance@BrooklynNets Honestly, good luck to him. Sorry to see Seth and Andre go, Ben wanted this so there's no reason for remorse. He'll need to be a more accountable teammate at some point in this league.

Watch@BrooklynNets @sdotcurry @AndreDrummond yessir brooklyn@WillNephew @RareFormTrading @204Landing @TYxREAPER @AmauriEdwards3 @crabbedapple @mccrystal_alex @BrooklynNets Seriously?  Read what you wrote again. . . He’s making $35m/year.  He was AWFUL in the ATL series. He was coddled for years despite not working on his game and being begged to shoot.  No one “bullied” Ben. . .he’s a weak person.  Wait until KD gets ahold of himI'd play Ben Simmons at Center @BrooklynNets@GlobalWealthCel @BrooklynNets What?!? You are so cluless it's sad.@TheHoopCentral @BrooklynNets Changing his number to 10 is great for marketing.@BrooklynNets Can ben simmons shoot the ball again? 😂@FreddyFelder @Drunkassuncle @WarriorsBr21 @BrooklynNets It’s real but it hit the rim and went left@BrooklynNets @BenSimmons25 Uhhhhh…..ok🤣 https://t.co/srk1MMaKwc@BrooklynNets Oooh I forgot that Blake is gonna play with Ben 😂😂😂 I can’t wait for @Suns vs @BrooklynNets@TheHoopCentral @BrooklynNets For his season high in points record@devontasgf @BrooklynNets @sdotcurry @AndreDrummond where tf is ratioNets reality show might be winding down in Brooklyn.

Will Sixers fans boo him incredibly loudly? I think probably so.@BrooklynNets @sdotcurry Sixers fans are going to miss Seth.  Class act on and off the court.The Brooklyn nets big 3 experiment was a failure point blank period . The organization took a L and Steve Nash is a horrible coach .@BrooklynNets QUITTER!!!@BrooklynNets Same loser@DortDiplo @LakerFan4ever87 @BrooklynNets Bro stop getting all your news from ESPN Philadelphia supported him until he said he didn’t want to play@BrooklynNets 10 the amount of points he’s finna score per game@BrooklynNets @sdotcurry @AndreDrummond Let's do it@BrooklynNets amount of poopies he takes before each game@BrooklynNets @BenSimmons25 @sdotcurry @AndreDrummond Ngl this if run correctly could be awesome@MacLoiasagaspie @BrooklynNets @JHarden13 He’s had more knee injuries than my grandma@BrooklynNets Same loser@BrooklynNets That boy #BEN10 !!!@BrooklynNets @sdotcurry @AndreDrummond Take care of our guys@DortDiplo @LakerFan4ever87 @BrooklynNets So when you’re depressed and you get a change in office space, and then suddenly you’ll be fine?

Nice!@BrooklynNets @sdotcurry @AndreDrummond Let’s go!!!!!Kevin Wayne Durant (/dəˈrænt/; born September 29, 1988) is an American professional basketball player for the Brooklyn Nets of the National Basketball Association (NBA). He played one season of college basketball for the Texas Longhorns, and was selected as the second overall pic@kevinwildes @FTFonFS1 @BrooklynNets meanwhile @sixers fans: https://t.co/HfVholMlS2@BrooklynNets Same broke jumper…@kevinwildes @FTFonFS1 Wildes :‘Please @BrooklynNets fans, Ben Simmons needs support your support!’ 

Nets fans : https://t.co/gfk5E5Iy6Jyo @NBA2K u needa add @BenSimmons25 to the @BrooklynNets@5starcoon @netsstan @BrooklynNets @sdotcurry @AndreDrummond 1 he’s averaging like .2 more turnovers per game this year than his MVP year.
2 only a few pounds heavier than 2018
3 he doesnt need to create his own shot as much when he’s not playing for a team he has to carry
4 he’s played 70+ games in almost every year
5 I agree@WillliamLemar I don’t believe the Nets will form chemistry fast enough to be a LEGIT threat in the offs. 

Harden game can almost be paired with anyone so him &amp; Embiid will find their chemistry quick. 

Brooklyn has a deeper team but has to deal with issues like KD’s health, Kyrie playing@ProfHinkley @BrooklynNets Only on the inside@michaelthemurr @BrooklynNets @NetsDaily @TheBKN3 @RealCodyMallory @BillyReinhardt @APOOCH Yes we did!! I’m energized for these last 27 games.@crabbedapple @mccrystal_alex @BrooklynNets Man I've seen so many people saying that we should've trade Ben for Hield, or that we should put Maxey in the trade. And we lost it?@ESPNNBA @BrooklynNets Wow crazy how he’s loved by the media now😂Brooklyn Nets didn’t do anything with the super team smh@tisseslov @BrooklynNets A Philly fan that likes Ben?@Adam_G_22 @5starcoon @netsstan @BrooklynNets @sdotcurry @AndreDrummond If you watched every game you would understand why those stats dont mean anything, but i think its just him not wanting to be a Net anymore.@BrooklynNets Is he crying?@BrooklynNets @AndreDrummond we very grateful for everything drummond did this half season, take care of this man pls@CMilholenSB Can’t believe we are in a “ play in spot “. Biggest reason? Irving’s ridiculous take on not getting vaccinated. Whatever happens the rest of the year, I want him out after this year. @BrooklynNets .@TheRealHoarse @LakerFan4ever87 @BrooklynNets Sometimes moving to a new or less emotionally draining helps a lot@BrooklynNets @sdotcurry @AndreDrummond We will miss both these guys best of luck can’t say the same for Ben Mr Softy Simmons with his fake mental issues big FAKE!!!@BrooklynNets @sdotcurry bawling my eyes out@DortDiplo @LakerFan4ever87 @BrooklynNets LOL. Delete this. That isn’t how mental health works.@BrooklynNets I hope you get your big szn, Ben, and don't bring mental issues just because you don't want to play!@BrooklynNets @sdotcurry @AndreDrummond Ben got Seth traded away from his family and a fanbase that loved him.  Great job, Ben!@Addyant23 @ColeDoesNotCare @BrooklynNets @sdotcurry @AndreDrummond You say this as they’re on a ten game slide 😂🤡@Adam_G_22 @netsstan @BrooklynNets @sdotcurry @AndreDrummond 1. He’s a turnover machine
2. He’s out of shape and overweight
3. He can’t create his own shot anymore, has no first step and can’t get by defenders anymore 
4. He’s injury prone
5. He was gonna leave regardless and the nets got a great deal@ESPNNBA @BrooklynNets Disrespectful to Ben 10@BrooklynNets Rooting for Ben ..he deserves better@iownjakesadly @EvadeMoonlight @anish_unleashed @embiidbetterlol @zachzeaman @BrooklynNets You crazy@BrooklynNets Let sparing begin https://t.co/ldjt3mKA7P@BrooklynNets Good Luck to Drummond and Seth!

But time will tell how well all three of them fit in with the Nets. Drummond and Curry are both great role players that can do alot if used properly.@BrooklynNets @sdotcurry @AndreDrummond Awe man poor seth@ajbrinton @GlobalWealthCel @BrooklynNets I believe that was Ben’s most efficient season(maybe his second)
