Everyone else is pretty much dedicated to have 2-3 superstars and minimum contract guys. It makes for some ugly basketball. Let's do it different!

Kupp only led the league in receptions, yards and TDs, nothing too crazy. 

But hey! Huerter almost averages 12It should be but apparently the Atlanta Hawks changed the way they operate because they decided they did not want to pay what John Collins what his production was going to be worth

The statistician in me is wondering how many missed shots resulted in a change of possession vs a rebound for 2 🤔@YaknowR @NBA @TheTraeYoung @ATLHawks As pure point gaurd... I'd agree..his control of the game is unmatched. Ja and Luka are great... But have different skill sets. Ja way more of an athletic scorer. Luka is not a point gaurd.
