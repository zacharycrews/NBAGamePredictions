*Must be 21+@utahjazz Nice 🔥🔥@utahjazz when you're scared, they aren't going to like it... Sweating intensifies@utahjazz bruh its already december?@utahjazz honeslty I was so scared they were going to pull another buzzer beater like the time during the grizzlies@TheHobby247 2021 Toronto Raptors Lot $20 OBO
2021 Utah Jazz Lot $30 OBO
2021 Washington Wizards Lot $20 OBO https://t.co/XArVLtWVe3@jazzteamstore @utahjazz Excuse me, who?@JoshBett1 @utahjazz A PF, one who can defend maybe another Rudy Gay-type of a player. Who’s available is the question mark.@SteezySquints @jazzteamstore @utahjazz Gotcha, that makes sense! I still find it weird that they have posted the price yet..... It seems like they originally advertised a T-Shirt too....@qwalterB @cynful103 @cavs @dallasmavs @evanmobley @Mavs @utahjazz Yeah, agree its been good banter. 
Also will agree to rescind my casual comment.@JiggaJazzman @jazzteamstore @utahjazz Which is probably a lot of Utah lol but as far why they haven’t responded im not sure lol@NBAHistory @utahjazz Right in front of MJ. #priceless@JiggaJazzman @jazzteamstore @utahjazz No I don’t think they are worried about price! For those who have been following Warren Lotas and his clothing are very much familiar with his prices so the prices will only come as a shock to anyone coming across his work for the first timeWhen I was young my dad, would treat my mom real bad every time the Utah Jazz would lose.My mom, the biggest Utah Jazz fan I know, having heard from me during the draft that Tarasenko wanted to be traded from the Blues, asked me if Kirilenko was still on my team. 😂 She was close.@SteezySquints @jazzteamstore @utahjazz THANKS for the info! I have asked them multiple times but they haven't responded.... I wonder why they aren't posting prices? 🤔 Do they think those price points will turn most fans away??@jazzteamstore @utahjazz @TaskRabbit you in SLC?@JiggaJazzman @jazzteamstore @utahjazz Release will be both T Shirt and Hoodie. Price range based off of other drops he has done should be $80-90 dollars for T Shirt and $175-$200 range for the hoodie. Limited Release only on that day at the Jazz Team Store.Get ready!!!!

https://t.co/rg5NU0rO73@utahjazz @SociosHoops Or ruddy defense ?@tribjazz A list of things that are so very Utah:

- funeral potatoes
- fry sauce
- Utah and BYU fans arguing
- skiing
- national parks
- the Utah Jazz

Racism is not "so very Utah". 

Do better @tribjazz, this is very gordonmonsonesque. There are better ways to get attention.@coach_ashton @utahjazz I’d take any of them for the jazz honestlyAmerica First CU &amp; Utah Jazz Team Up – Credit Union Times https://t.co/wsox1bWNlKAmerica First CU &amp; Utah Jazz Team Up – Credit Union Times https://t.co/7Ju4mg72Q7@jazzteamstore @JordanClarksons @utahjazz @airolgperezz wantI need more @utahjazz games in my life! These 3 day waits are horrible! Who made this schedule?! 🤦‍♂️. #TakeNoteThe Utah Jazz should change their name to the Utah Jizz because there’s way more Jizz than Jazz in Utah.@WheresTheBall97 @RatioedByLakers @ShamsCharania Im a laker fan and i defended the fanbase for a while but now after recent times i can agree and say yes we have alot of toxic utah jazz like fans. People say we are as toxic as the utah jazz fanbase and at this point alot of fans are proving it.@JazzUniTracker @jazzteamstore @utahjazz Thank you. Saved me some time. Haha.
