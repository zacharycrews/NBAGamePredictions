The Lakers game was a given W considering Bron and AD weren’t playingSan Antonio Spurs At Dallas Mavericks via @visit_dallas: https://t.co/V8L0A18jzjMavs @ Cavs

At the end of a b2b, Dallas will take on a Cleveland team sitting in 7th place in the East. Usually, we'd avoid a team on the back end but considering the Mavericks thrashing of LAL and their strong play of late, going 5-1-1 ATS, we can back in Luka.

They're currently in 11th place in the Western Conference with seven games left.The @dallasmavs may be in the third seed with a victory over CLE tomorrow, after being 17-18 at a point this season. Doesn’t that show @luka7doncic value? #MVP??? #MFFL #WeTalkMavs@DickieV @Lakers @KingJames @AntDavis23 @dallasmavs Would love to see Cuban out there, that would sell tickets!@dallasmavs thank you@WorldWideWob Like and RT me to thank
