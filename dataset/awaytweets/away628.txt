@zachcolwellPtR with y'all tonight as the San Antonio Spurs try to break a 4 game losing streak.

To do so they will have to beat a young and talented Cleveland Cavaliers team.

2u Cleveland Cavaliers -2 (-125)

The Cavs are a leagues best 27-14 ATS. On a 2 game win streak and get a banged up Spurs team. The Cavs size &amp; rim protection will be a problem for the Spurs who score most of their points in the paint.
#Fanduel https://t.co/GCuE189ItJ@CavsSense @cavs @firstenergycorp He's on min restriction as of now.@BoxingAddiction @cavs Yeah if you make that deal for Simmons you also need some scoring coming back.

I never realized that. I forgot we have that 2nd rounder from Houston, so that has some value. I still would assume we’d have to give up a first in a Levert trade, but hoping that you’re correct!@cavs #JarrettAllen isnt an #NBAAllStar unfortunatelyRandom former Cleveland Cavaliers player.

Indi gets a young sg who is a indi native. Probably buys out rubio and saves money and gets a top 40 pick. Cavs get a bucket for 2 years , levert off the bench.. and an ohio native. Great move for a playoff push. Levert has also played with allen and ed@cavs vote #DariusGarland for #NBAAllStar @thinkinofoneHave you voted your Cavs for #NBAAllStar yet today?

Probably similar package to what I put there for lillard.

@isaacokoro303 | #LetEmKnow https://t.co/SdOT7NimJG@tjbenton14 @cavs Yeah I can see both ways tbh. I’m interested about Levert. He fits very well. But assuming we’d have to trade Okoro or Collin. For a while I thought sexton wouldn’t be here, but we really can use another dude that creates shots himself. Simmons is intriguing also.How it begins…

(@SerenaWinters already acclimated to CLE weather and keeping her feet warm!) https://t.co/lcJOjUvuP5@BackseatGM1 @cavs Only way is if they played on QO for that one year and then became unrestricted, which never actually happens with top players. Still, I’ll feel better once Garland signs that big contract extension!@BoxingAddiction @cavs Still unsure if the Cavs make a big trade this season. It's unfortunate for them to not be able to see how they would perform with a healthy Sexton.

It’s Cavs as in Cleveland Cavaliers. My favorite basketball team.@tjbenton14 @cavs Just depends what Portland is trying to do and what offers come in. If they trade both Dame and CJ, they might get a lot of young players for Dame and then be willing to give up Mccollum for mostly picks. They have a few options now.@john44653635 @cavs @_bigjayy_ That trade was between the Cavs and Rockets lil bro Rockets gave y’all JA for Exum and a pick@VetteIista @onlytaron @TheHoopCentral at the age of 23 years old lebron led his cleveland cavaliers to 66 records and was an mvp@CavsTeamShop @_bigjayy_ @cavs @RMFieldHouse Gone already you guys need to get more fast@BoxingAddiction @cavs Yeah I know. Don't know if you get it done without giving up either Sexton or Okoro but man that would be a game changer.@tjbenton14 @cavs I’d do that in a second! To keep Love, Sexton, Okoro, and get a guy like CJ. What a deal. It’s insane how fast Koby has built up our assets. So much flexibility@BackseatGM1 @cavs I’ll feel better one Garland and Mobley have been extended haha! But part of the reason I’m wanting a star type of veteran is Allen just signed for 5 years. So I look at that as the window. If we don’t win by then, it makes me wonder if one of those guys decides to leave.@cavs @_bigjayy_ I remember people not wanting him because we already had Drummond lmao@JmCalderon @TheNBPA @MRobertsNBPA @cavs Congratulations, welcome back!@_bigjayy_ @cavs All star@cavs @JmCalderon OFFICIAL: ￼#Cavs hire José

Even if you add a vet, it’s not this year. I think a proven star with playoff experience makes 2 years realistic. This team has the potential to build more organically too, but honestly man, free agency scares me. They seem happy, but who knows if that changes…@nbatopshot @cavs @evanmobley Mission accomplished! https://t.co/jfd0UXD58c@BoxingAddiction @cavs They’re not winning it this year and that’s not even the target. They think they have three potential all NBA players on this team right now and they are going to surround them w/players to help them grow and mature… along with other ppl. The target is in 2-3 yrs to win it@nbatopshot @cavs @evanmobley John Konchar 17 rebounds!!give this man his debut lol cause he needs a moment!!

For those looking for Vanderbilt LOL@BackseatGM1 @cavs Ok, so based on that, when in the last 30 years has a team with their 3 best players under 25 won a ring?

None of those characteristics match this team they are building.  It’s not even close and now he’s also probably out for the year.  Find a different player that makes sense.  They need a 2 or 3@nickfromcwe @cavs That would be a young fun roster. If they’re gonna rebuild, they ought to begin immediately. Like you said, tank for a top draft choice. Add a few good players who have youth in Sexton, Okoro, Lauri, and bring the hometown guy back. Cavs become top 3 East by 2023!@cavs @evanmobley I would love me one of those 👀👀 https://t.co/M7RijckTVW@BackseatGM1 @cavs I don’t see it. Big differences between Dame &amp; Russ. The biggest is Lillard can shoot! Also he’s played with another ball handler in CJ for a while and they work fairly well. Him &amp; Garland could too imo. Also, if the Cavs brought young Bron a player like Dame, he’d be here still!@cavs @dariusgarland22 Those unis are 🔥@cavs I need tickets to all star weekend@BoxingAddiction @cavs Yeah a super max who is ball dominant shoot first pg and will make 40 plus mil in his mid 30s.  Does that sound familiar??  Hint he’s currently a Laker, formerly OKC, HOU &amp; WAS.   You don’t bring a guy like that in.  Don’t do what the Cavs did when LBJ was a kid and f this up.@BoxingAddiction @cavs Simons and Little are good pieces to keep for them. All those ex Cavs dudes would make the team interesting to say the least@TheNBACentral @JakeLFischer @cavs just inquire about the asking price of mr Deandre hunter@BackseatGM1 @cavs He’s definitely our point guard, but he played well with Rubio. I could see this pair being electric. His contract is what a super max guy earns. We’re never gonna draw a FA here like Lillard, so why not see that happen, while keeping our stars?Any one interested in season tickets with Your Cleveland Cavaliers ❤️💛? MESSAGE ME@BoxingAddiction @cavs Dame is injured and his contract is awful and Garland is the point guard of the #Cavs … period@BackseatGM1 @cavs If we could get a legitimate superstar without giving up any of big three, I feel like we’d need to. That’s a contender@cavs @_bigjayy_ 2000th like… does that mean I win?!!😂@nickfromcwe @cavs They need to tear it up and tank man.
