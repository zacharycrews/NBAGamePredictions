Pre-game notes: PHX is on an 11-gm winning streak and is 15-2 vs the East; ATL is 10-10 vs the West. https://t.co/y93h3Gq7Lg https://t.co/cCUQmR0KihThe @Suns prolly gonna smack @ATLHawks but hopefully we can keep it competitive @929TheGame with the bad shoulder @TheTraeYoung needs to come out hot and firing on all cylinders @MikeBellATL @putemupcdukes ..19-4 on road phoenix isTNT SGP Promo. Free bet, so taking a shot. Ayton 15/8 will forever be my favorite bet. Atlanta allows 2nd most assists to PG’s (CP3), Phoenix allows 2nd most ppg to PGs (Young). Huerter at 1.5 is extremely low.

However, in only his 7th game w/PHX, Elliott Perry finished with 2p (0-6 FG) and a career-high 17a, just two days after setting his previous high, with 14a. #ValleyProud https://t.co/GxpISmn1NpALERT: New high roller bet posted!

To view this bet or copy it https://t.co/qS7pFMJxur https://t.co/e1eHzPmFpR@realAdamWhite @Suns Expensive contract into next year too and would cost a lot for Gordon. Cavs probably trump any offer though with Sexton. Far more appealing than any combo of Saric/Shamet/Smith. Any team wanting Smith better off signing in FA. The other two have negative trade value.Atlanta Hawks - Phoenix Suns
