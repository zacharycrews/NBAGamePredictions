📺: @BallySportsSW | 
⏰: 6 p.m. E.T.There was a week of time in the history of the Dallas Mavericks where they had Luka Doncic, Tim Hardaway Jr., Harrison Barnes and Kristaps Porzingis on the same team. Obviously Porzingis hadn't played yet but then they dealt Barnes. Feel like they should have just seen it out.So, like, in hindsight the Dallas Mavericks trading Harrison Barnes for Justin Jackson and Zach Randolph was a pretty bad move.First NBA game @okcthunder @dallasmavs https://t.co/Hp4DZPDhCoGetting all the @HoustonRockets stuff in my feed bcuz of @emaad_is so I gotta spam the @dallasmavs stuff for him 😜 https://t.co/yf5a6FESPGDallas Mavericks: Kristaps Porzingis to rest as Mavericks face Thunder in Oklahoma City https://t.co/kNwaakrZWk@dallasmavs @luka7doncic finally i’ve missed him hella@dallasmavs starting line up jalen, luka, maxi, and both browns?@dallasmavs @luka7doncic I hope Luka got into better shape during that time off.

starting 5 tomorrow @dallasmavs ?He’s backkkkkkkkkk.
🚨 Timmmyyy @dallasmavs@luka7doncic for @DeMar_DeRozan? Who says no? #MFFL @dallasmavs @chicagobullsDeRozan is such a bad fit for the Dallas Mavericks. An actively bad player, if you willI saw on another tweet, from a disgruntled customer who was part of the @dallasmavs official NFT discord who had been affected by the @DinosChibi discord scam - where hackers compromised a moderator account and posted a fake mint. Seeing that tweet, I wandered into Mavs discord.@SkyFuckerFan @nbafan_1x24 @NBAMemes Im a fan of the nuggets and Mavericks. When my parents moved to America they went to Denver i was born in Dallas. So my parents like the nuggets so I like the nuggets but i live in Dallas so i also like the Mavericks.@Justagu53978548 @rylanbishop22 @BitcoinMagazine @CynthiaMLummis @cryptomark22 @dallasmavs He can lose. Tesla currently HOLDS bitcoins on the balance sheet. They obviously have a stake. What are u even saying rn@Justagu53978548 @rylanbishop22 @BitcoinMagazine @CynthiaMLummis @cryptomark22 @dallasmavs Obviously. Stocks are worth nothing, the dollar is just a piece of paper, gold is a rock. Sure in literal sense. But people are placing value in these things. They are agreeing it’s worth X amount.Catch the game at 6PM CT tomorrow as we take on the @okcthunder on @BallySportsSW!

#MFFL https://t.co/il9CGvdCxf@Justagu53978548 @rylanbishop22 @BitcoinMagazine @CynthiaMLummis @cryptomark22 @dallasmavs You’re saying Tesla taking on bitcoins on a publicity traded company is a game? Lmfao I’m done with you. Just admit that Bitcoin has at least some value. A company of this magnitude obviously agrees it has value if they have billions of it on the balance sheetHow to #style inexpensive shoes Nike OG Challenger @expressmen #expressyou #nba75💎 @lukadoncic @dallasmavs #budget #fashion #fashion #royalblue #kish_yz https://t.co/wRq9zXwARF@Justagu53978548 @rylanbishop22 @BitcoinMagazine @CynthiaMLummis @cryptomark22 @dallasmavs They do not cash it in. Tesla holds bitcoins on the balance sheet. Explain that one to me?Luka Doncic among three Dallas #Mavericks to clear health and safety protocols - ESPN https://t.co/tooTSOZgYhLuka Doncic among three Dallas #Mavericks to clear health and safety protocols - ESPN https://t.co/3vxQQVdiEj@Justagu53978548 @rylanbishop22 @BitcoinMagazine @CynthiaMLummis @cryptomark22 @dallasmavs The fact that 2 multi billion companies agreed to exchange their product for bitcoins proves that it has its place in the financial system. It HAS value. Otherwise I could offer them bottle caps in exchange. But they’d decline. Cause the bottle caps are worthless. See my point?The Dallas Mavericks will not be signing PG Carlik Jones to another 10-day contract.@Justagu53978548 @rylanbishop22 @BitcoinMagazine @CynthiaMLummis @cryptomark22 How about buying a Tesla or buying @dallasmavs tickets? Both accept/accepted bitcoins as payments. I guess that’s no value? You gotta remember blockchains are in infancy in terms of adoption.
