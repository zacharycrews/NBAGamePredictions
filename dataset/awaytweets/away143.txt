https://t.co/GsETZzgkCHEver been to San Antonio? It’s a city in Texas &amp; let me tell you, what a popping city! Looking for fun, then come on down to San Antonio, just a great town to hang out with your buds in! Even with a team like the Spurs it’s still a great time to be in this town! Come on down! https://t.co/zII2EYqXijShai Gilgeous-Alexander o23.5 Points (-105, WH)
 
Averaging 26 PPG over his L6, SGA sees a nice matchup against a Spurs defense that is bleeding points to opposing PGs. He previously dropped 33 and 42 in his last two matchups vs San Antonio, I like him to stay hot here.
