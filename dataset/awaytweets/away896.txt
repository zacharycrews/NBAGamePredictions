I‚Äôm not even from New Orleans, hell I‚Äôve only been there once, but I sure as hell know how much the city loves the Pelicans and basketball in general.@Crawford_MILB Also, regarding the whole "Seattle needs a team", I was thinking that the Pelicans should move to Seattle, but then the Thunder should move to New Orleans.

Louisiana is basketball country. Plenty of pedigree says we should support keeping the Pelicans in New Orleans.

https://t.co/3lCGrrBDfW@kt_wza Perk for some reason went on a Pelicans fan Space and basically called out the city of New Orleans and how no one wants to play there and everyone went off at perk!!The problem with saying the New Orleans Pelicans need to relocate because, "we can't keep a star".
