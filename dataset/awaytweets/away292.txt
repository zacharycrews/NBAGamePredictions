Especially when you're starting a PG who can't defend a mailbox &amp; a SG who isn't much better defensively, but is even worse when paired with the aforementioned PG.@nyknicks @deucemcb11 1st bucket off a steal from Chris Paul !! Memory of a lifetime !!Match: Atlanta Hawks - New York Knicks

Plus Ayton, Bridges, Crowder, and Payne are phenomenal role players. The team is more talented it’s not solely a matter of coaching@nyknicks @MSGNetworks @BetMGM win or we riot@KnicklightsYT @nyknicks No. Just stop with the announcer yelling it and play the actual MTA doors opening/closing sound. You’re welcomeGame not in New York so it doesn’t feel as big, but I hope the hawks beat the breaks off the Knicks 

If Fournier torches us after going 4/15 last night I’m gonna be sick@Evan_Mattel21 @nyknicks Suns simply manage their roster better than the #Knicks.

Notice Suns actually START THEIR BEST POINT GUARD to get them in rhythm &amp; off to good starts while playing him 7-8 minutes per quarter so he can finish strong.

Knicks bring their best PG off the bench usually down 10+ptsNovember 27, 1970: Willis Reed scores 34 PTS (15-27 FG) and grabs 10 REB as the Knicks defeat the Bucks in Milwaukee, 103-94.

The Bucks’ win streak ends at 16 games. The teams would face each other again the next day in New York (the Knicks won, 100-99). https://t.co/n0HYzzgvwII need to see a @TheLazyBunnyNFT ad in MSG for the next @nyknicks game@aespa_official @TheGarden @nyknicks I know deep in my heart that someday u girls will have a sold out at MSG and be filled with all MY’s. 💕🥰💚. https://t.co/HGPbGAKipU@ATLHawks @nyknicks @StateFarmArena @BallySportsSO @929TheGame Buzzard Beating Hawks ya digPhoenix Suns roll New York Knicks for 15th straight win https://t.co/PrGb0noNMk@ATLHawks @nyknicks @StateFarmArena @BallySportsSO @929TheGame 8 GAME WINNING STREAK PLEASEDerrick Rose New York Knicks Nike Blue Authentic Vaporknit Jersey 36-52: https://t.co/oPilLPmMqB https://t.co/okLmwXdn0j@aespa_official @TheGarden @nyknicks Karina being invited by the 3rd most valuable sports franchise in the world.

What are your thoughts on the team through 19 games?It’s not looking good for the Knicks i fear. 4-6 in their last 10 and going up against the hottest team in the NBA + New York’s biggest menaceThat's 15 straight! 5th straight game shooting over 50% as a team. They Hold the Knicks under 100 points and Devin Booker is the King of New York! This is starting to get scary for the NBA and they haven't played their best Basketball yet IMO.

And if they misjudged how good Randle would be that’s another alarm.Evan Fournier with less than 15 so its an L. I need him to hit 15 somehow. It could be by points or assist equaling.5 that’ll equal out as offense generated. #Knicks #KnicksTape Get back to #BIG15 ASAP @nyknicks @KnicksFanTvAESPA’S AT THE NEW YORK KNICKS GAME????@nyknicks Yeah Knicks would of lost 12-14 pts every other night but their defense would of been on point every night with Bullock, Ntilikina &amp; Payton. I was 1 of the guys that thought more scoring would help but it’s killing them. Walker, Fournier are getting smoke in every game so far@KnicksMemes @nyknicks Im glad I didn't watch that schit show....@TheRealTacko @nyknicks You wanted to beat the defending western champions on a 14 game win streak and some of our key players out?

At least the young guys played https://t.co/Yc3MTlCqbM@nyknicks They may contend for the play in game but it’s pretty obvious this team just doesn’t have enough talent to be much more than a .500 record. New GM same bad draft picks/free agent signings@nyknicks Record: 10-9 is whatever but we look way worse then that. Time for adjustments in the starting lineup. I think its kemba/evans fault for RJ slump but im ok w having RJ come off the bench. Anything to get him away from those two ball pounders. Or start IQ very simple.@TheUnderKing1 @nyknicks @Suns Cash it!!@nyknicks Never in this game@nyknicks Suns are hella good, I’m not mad@nyknicks @deucemcb11 Likely would have had first career points way before tonight had he got more than a minute in prior games@AKid0628 @NBA @nyknicks nothing@bkbet22 @TheRealTacko @jsilverman81 @nyknicks I agree, and they picked apart every major problem the Knicks have, which is what makes this loss significant.@nyknicks This team is just bad.@nyknicks Tom's rotation is absolutely terrible, clueless!@DomMaio3 @FreckledMamba @nufc223 @nyknicks Fn with ya.

The Suns offense from the starters and bench were on fire. The Knicks couldn’t slow them down at all. 

The Knicks has to figure something out. They ain’t going to make it far playing like this.

I think this team has a 1st round ceiling, which is fine. I just wanna see a clear direction from the front office.

From his inability to create a system that fits his talent, to his fundamentally flawed Iso heavy , unimaginative, uncreative O, he’s being EXPOSED. 9 team dimes ??This is a STEAL for the New York Knicks https://t.co/bd4CRqfcqA@nyknicks Julius Randle is a good basketball player…against bad basketball teams.@nyknicks IMO RJ will never develop under Thibs. The Knicks should trade RJ, Knox, Nerlens and a first round pick to the Pelicans for Brandon Ingram. BI will want out from the Pelicans shortly. They are a rebuilding team. He will not defer to Randle on offense@_modelotimeram @starboyjcross @nyknicks ... hello.  

Where's that energy from earlier?The only positive in this game is that Grimes get to have a good run today.

On to the next one, @nyknicks.

AND we have no Rose. i mean cmon broYOU ARE THE FUTURE OF NEW YORK KNICKS BASKETBALL @IQ_GodSonTonight, November 26th 2021, let’s me know, that Derrick Rose is the best player on the New York Knicks.

Just embarrassing 🙈@nyknicks My fellow Knick fans 
Ja Morant or RJ Barrett🤔@JBurs13 @NBA @Suns @nyknicks 🤣🤣🤣 I’m keeping this for sure bruhhhSuns still up on the Knicks heading into the fourth 88-71. 

New York made an early run and they're moving the ball better, but Phoenix just keeps hitting big shots. Booker is torching everyone. 

Booker: 32 PTS, 4-9 3Ps
Ayton: 10 PTS, 10 REBS
Crowder: 11 PTS, 3-4 3PsEnd of the 3rd Quarter:

Suns: 88
Knicks: 71

Phoenix continuing to hit big shot after big shot preventing New York from making any runs. Booker remains dominant for the Suns with 32 points.

#NewYorkForeverI can take the L as the @Suns are a good team, but not without effort. If we lose, we go down fighting.

We have 12 more minutes to grit and grind the @nyknicks way.

But they don’t realize how hard it is to win 14 in a row.@nyknicks Your parent company, @MSG needs to come to an agreement with @Comcast / @Xfinity so your fans can watch the  games!Our offense looks HORRENDOUS @nyknicks ..

You are much better than this.. @nyknicks https://t.co/kfREyp13MDBooker ate RJ in the first half. RJ should defend him more aggressively. If not, Book is going to score 40 tonight

Randle now has to find his points and be aggressive. 

Let’s see the @nyknicks grit and grind in the 2nd half.

#NewYorkForever@nyknicks Knicks will not go anywhere relying on defense (which they aren't even playing well). Teams need to be balanced and Knicks only rely on the 3 which they can't expect to hit 60% all game long..especially the Knicks who aren't consistent at all..they either hot or cold.@nyknicks getting smacked@nyknicks Knicks tonight... https://t.co/phvAv7xFdQ@nyknicks Team Work 🏀⛹️ Defense 🏀⛹️ offense 🏀⛹️ let's gooooooooo Knicks@nyknicks Thibs gotta bench Fournier. If it was Obi and IQ taking bad shots and playing bad defense, they would be taken out so fast. That’s what I hate about Thibs. He sticks with the vets no matter what@alanhahn The problem is when good teams come to @TheGarden our #Knicks never have the best player on the floor. They didn’t in the 90’s, 00’s or now. When will the @nyknicks ever have that guy? 🤷🏻‍♂️@nyknicks Knicks need to bully the Suns..they have bigger players and should get inside more...sadly they have no gameplan on offense...Thibs spends no time on offensive planning.. IQ even said so..as long as they play hard defense...he let's them be themselves on offense..Big second half needed by the @nyknicks here @TheGarden , great venue and atmosphere always special. https://t.co/oSczXIHENw@rejectedjokes @nyknicks @obitoppin1 Nice one, Benny Schwaa 🙌🏼@Suns This is what the @nyknicks deserve for those stupid unis@nyknicks please no 3rd Qtr of Doom, Knicks. https://t.co/CtlQhmdTC9The New York Knicks need to make this a hacker and wackham game by driving to the paint all game@nyknicks is it possible to take it to the rack Knicks?
cut down on the bricks...@real_law_4H @hopefulmetsfan @ThekidLuiii @nyknicks Ok nobody is stopping booker he’s playing good defense it’s just better offense and Evan is shooting 30 percent and hasn’t scored since the beginning of the game with bad defense@JawnVito @Suns @nyknicks Sir Charles 🍀

Please be a little bit better at basketball in the second half

Sincerely,

New York's getting lazy.

Lol sit down@JfromBk @nyknicks I am fine with triple overtime Bing BongDevin Booker is getting whatever he wants so far against the Knicks. He's already up to 17 points, and the Suns are now up 48-34 with 3:58 to go in the second. Phoenix has outscored New York 24-11 over the last 12 minutes of action.@nyknicks Let’s Go Knicks!

I’ve experienced every emotion humanly possible regarding how he’s played 😂@nyknicks can @TheGarden play the #statefarm theme when Chris Paul shoots to distract him while we the Phoenix Suns #LetsGoKnicks #NewYorkForeverThis Bing Bong ish sounds so forced rn. @nyknicks #knicksnation #Knickstape@PlayoffBoundNYK @nyknicks Rj is ass@PlayoffBoundNYK @nyknicks And the magicTimeout Knicks with 6:00 to go in the half and they still trail the Suns by 8. 

New York is shooting just 34% from the field and 33% from deep. Meanwhile, Devin Booker leads all scorers with 11 points.

A quick 11 points in 12 minutes for Devin Booker, while Evan Fournier has nine points to lead New York. Both teams started out hot, with Phoenix shooting 14-for-22 and the Knicks going 9-for-18, including 4-for-6 from 3.Suns lead the Knicks after the first period 33-27.

New York can't handle the pick and roll right now. Everyone on Phoenix is finding space to score when they attack with it. Could be a long night for NY if they don't adjust.

Booker: 11 PTS, 5-9 FGs
Ayton: 8 PTS, 4-4 FGs@nyknicks Can someone get RJ Barrett a coach to teach him how to finish at the rim..he is REALLY bad at putting in baskets from 1 foot away@nyknicks his name is Cam Johnson not Cam Jordan….. idk how u keep messing that up… @TheGarden 

@Suns #GoSuns@BleacherReport New York Knicks#handsDownThis is about to be another @NBA #Refs cheating the @nyknicks this is sickening and petty #NewYorkForeverBooker is so much fun to watch. I wonder if the Suns want to trade him to us for Kevin Knox? 🤔
