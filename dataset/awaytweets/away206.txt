Miami’s Jimmy Butler and Bam Adebayo are both out tonight.@MiamiHEAT Cold@HighkeyMarco @MiamiHEAT Oh 💯 lol, no doubt. Love the profile pic btw@KellyNBC6 @MiamiHEAT Awesome!!!@Iucassccp_ @MiamiHEAT Ciume?@MiamiHEAT Herro drop 50 tonight@xandergomez @MiamiHEAT Butler turned 32 2 months ago…..Most people know what Oregon’s offensive scheme is like, but not much is aid about their defense. 

I liken their approach to the @MiamiHEAT with positionless defense, using versatility and athleticism of players.

Then today the best team in the nba want to all of a sudden lose. This parlay shit is something else@SmokinTreesDra1 @BlackKing0731 @JustRyCole The 96 bulls lost to a 21 win Toronto team. Few loses don’t dictate a good team even the Miami heat with Lebron started like 8-9@FTX_Official @TomBrady @giseleofficial @StephenCurry30 @Trevorlawrencee @MLB @kevinolearytv @LCSOfficial @MiamiHEAT @riotgames @TSM Join $elon to mars! #dogelon #dogelonmars@MiamiHEAT I can’t wait to see what else they got!!!Some of my favorite combos
