@samdubs0 @DogSurfRoadshow @warriors Right now I get having Wiggins in for scoring but they also need more defensive tenacity -- been lacking on that front for weeks@warriors A great rest for Kevon. Love itThe Golden State Warriors are set to play @ATLHawks today at 6:30 p.m. Jordan Poole aims to continue his hot streak while the Hawks strive to clinch a spot in the East.@TrixzyInsane @warriors Or Wiggins off the bench and run curry poole klay kuminga and dray@samdubs0 @DogSurfRoadshow @warriors I think this is a transition I moreso want when lineup is fully healthy Curry-Thompson-Poole-Kuminga-Green imo will be our highest net rating lineup.@warriors I think we are kinda fucked.@jvhein2 @Neferpi74723512 @warriors Then he has a better chance to recover. He'll still be younger than most lottery draft picks this year@49ersPolitics @DogSurfRoadshow @warriors If he comes of the bench do you reduce his minutes?@DogSurfRoadshow @warriors I like the lineup, small ball it’s great and scary lineup for the league@Trell707 @warriors I told niggaz lol . @RobAndreacchi22 how long I been sayin wiseman was ass ?@Trell707 @warriors Embid missed two years, Wiseman is only 20@warriors How much help does LeBron need?@warriors @NBCSAuthentic speaking of dubs that’s what y’all gon get tonight 💯@warriors Best wishes to James Wiseman for a complete recovery.@samdubs0 @DogSurfRoadshow @warriors can contribute off the bench perhaps even better given he's been struggling as a starterHawks / Warriors ... Tip in about 8 mins .. 

Not gonna lie, it looks like Golden State South in here right now.@DogSurfRoadshow @warriors With 80 year old legs! HahaESPN Sources: Golden State Warriors center James Wiseman has been ruled out for the rest of the season and will continue rehabilitating his right knee. Wiseman has been recovering from a meniscus repair last April, and the team has been cautious to protect him for the long-term. https://t.co/gA2hLylhjO@warriors @NBCSAuthentic Wiggins has the same contract as Beal, Kat Towns, Jokic, Booker and Embid.@Moonorchid @warriors Looney’s young! 😂@TagYourIt_18 @mercihoops @niallmcgirr1 @dshih199 @AshuLeRat @warriors not what I was asking, but even then you're still wrong@49ersPolitics @DogSurfRoadshow @warriors You realistically need his scoring surely?@warriors And you continue to refuse to sign a center.

Why?@warriors The best player that never was 😔@warriors This has happened to so many teams that drafted the big man over the talented guy. Ugh hopefully he gets it turned around like the Process@warriors Then he’ll be well rested before next season starts😀👍@DogSurfRoadshow @warriors We have to mix up old and young legs@DogSurfRoadshow @warriors Matchup based??@alexandernev I remember it well. Golden State Warriors game. He had played 2 shows a few days before at a theater in Oakland, which I attended. A few days later he played 2 concerts in the very same venue where he was watching the game. Then the next month he was gone.@warriors Damn 🤦🏽‍♂️@warriors without a real center we are 1st round exit🏀 GAME ANALYSIS 🏀

Imagine Lamelo and Kuminga on the break for a decade. https://t.co/XNwiz5CRDv@warriors But ya could have went after boogie but nah. Stubborn ass ppl...that gm and Kerr@warriors So can we add another big man to replace him? @GSWRedditThank God y’all passed on Lamelo @warriors https://t.co/WhCA1K7qGE@warriors I'm not gonna say he's a bust yet since I can see his potential, but what I can say is that he's overhyped and he didn't live up to that hype, which resulted in him being a disappointment.@warriors Hopefully Wiseman recovers in time for Vegas Summer League. I’d like see what he can do against this year’s top draft picks in Vegas. Holmgren, Duren and Banchero vs. Wiseman.@SeanP_Small @warriors thank you so much!! 😁🙏@warriors We could’ve had LaMelo 🤦🏿‍♂️@warriors get well soon 🙏 (SO WE CAN TRADE U )@warriors Kevon looney https://t.co/l5qlGkBKbH@warriors It’s getting hard to be a Warriors fan. 3 consecutive years and counting w/out a healthy roster… it can’t all be bad luck…@warriors And our FO decided not to find a big man https://t.co/cqZS4PemHn@dshih199 @warriors Yeah you’re right@warriors Waived him!! Warriors need bigman in playoffs just sign big man in remaining of season! Wtf!@warriors What a shocker… if only we had a back up planPregame with @warriors Head Coach Steve Kerr. The Warriors visit the @ATLHawks tonight in Atlanta. He was asked about shutting down James Wiseman for the year. Kerr stated, “We are protecting his future.” @FortyEightMins #DubNation #NBA75 https://t.co/HHV5wEXArO@warriors There goes the championship dream, we all saw this coming and yet they refused to sign a center.@dshih199 @AshuLeRat @warriors Who cares warriors would have had lamelo 😂@warriors Soo sorry to hear this.  💔   Get him healthy for next season. He has a bright 🌞 future ahead of him. 🏀

Dam@tru3azy @warriors Uhm well I have no better question if I’m on the court and living my dreams. I had box seats with full buffet. Oh and we had court side seats to watch them warm up.@warriors You know what I'm gonna stick with this team till the end even without steph! I believe this group of players can still achieve alot of success and go far without our key players!!@RhysBigDog @warriors They might try to run him out there during summer league. If wiseman looks good against this year’s top draft picks maybe they keep him. It could increase his trade value if he plays well.@warriors Could have had lamelo@warriors Damn! They’re really hoping he turns it around like Embiid if not he’ll go down as a bigger draft day bust in W’s history 
Todd fuller at least had a couple of decent years 😂@3bycurry @warriors I still believe in him🤷‍♂️@BlissCameron_ @warriors Who?  

Who is this great back up big thats just sitting there that will play for cheap?@warriors Huge gamble by Myers not making deadline trades ..... a gamble that we all lost.@warriors Get well soon bro ♥️@warriors All behind a meniscus? Must be more to this injury. This really sucks I’m still hoping for the best for the young man.@warriors Get well soon❤@warriors @Flight23White thoughtsThe Golden State Warriors officially announced that center James Wiseman is out for the season.@warriors hoping he gets better and gets right for next season. he’s gonna be special. shame on the front office for not getting some help for him and looney.@warriors Good, get him fully healthy for his first summer league and first preseason.@warriors Sad. But I'm glad that they are being cautious with the young man. He has a bright future if they don't push him.@warriors Oh shoot. Should have traded  or bought out another big. Now what?@warriors FUCK@warriors Don’t forget how long it took Embid to get on the floor…@RhysBigDog @warriors Highly doubt it.@warriors @anthonyVslater SIGN A GLEAGUE BIG MAN@warriors I would say give it a run this year and really work for next year, get everyone healthy and get the rotations down.

Almost guaranteed to be traded in the off season@warriors @anthonyVslater Looney and Draymond will be out for the 2022-2023 season as well (back).@warriors Speedy recovery Wise@wojespn @warriors Also, if Wiseman is not ready to go by game 1 next season…we need to have a conversation about his future.

Grizz have made 9 triples in the first quarter alone tonight. There's still 2 minutes left to play@goatedwok @LockedOnDubs @StephenCurry30 He’s just such a great human being. #DubNation is lucky he’s on the @warriors and a huge reason why I gripe on Lacob &amp; Co. when they make pennypinching decisions is because they’re depriving Steph of the glory he deserves.@warriors @SociosUSA Damion… I’ll be going wild@BSarver35 Even though Curry isn't playing due to a foot injury warriors still got Klay Dray Wiggins and Jordan Poole. Actually Golden State beat Miami yesterday without Steph Klay or Dray@EricPMusselman @mosesmoody @StephenCurry30 @ChaseCenter @warriors Coach, your shirt is the bomb!
