frgb@subZZro @warriors LMAOHere we GOOOO @warriors we absolutely need this win tonight. #DubNation is with you!!I don’t think the Warriors winning or losing hinges on Kerr starting Porter instead of Looney.

Lots of hand wringing on the TL for something that might be the 6th or 7th most important factor for Golden State in this game.It’s time to #NBAFinals

Warriors have held Celtics to 97.4 points per 100 possessions in the 37 minutes that Draymond Green and Kevon Looney have shared the floor in the 2022 NBA Finals.

Must win for golden state and think they get it done today. With a win you get 2-2 series and they move back to being the favorites, which makes the +200 a nice value play

#NBA75 https://t.co/dkhalumd5OI’m rooting for @warriors for two reasons: 
1. I’m a @MiamiHEAT girl #305tilidie and by default cannot go for the @celtics 
And 2 .. most importantly… 
I watched @winningtimehbo and I just cannot in good conscious go for that fuxking team. 

#NBAPlayoffs #nbafinals@CelticssUp @warriors we will go up@warriors Gooo Steph@warriors we better win this one😎@warriors BraboWhy is this year’s @warriors team getting so much hate?
- No KD
- Klay back from 2 years of injuries
- Homegrown star in Poole
- Steph going nuts

I just don’t understand it. I understand Draymond is a controversial player, but this team? Embodies everything good about basketball@warriors Now that's how to speak up. It's devastating to see our country in such turmoil. I praise this speech so much.#NBAPlayoffs

So, look for Green to make some kind of boneheaded physical play bordering on dirty to try to fire up his team.Even with Golden State down 2-1 in the series, @THEKIDMERO tells @EvCoRadio he still has the Warriors winning it all.

Boston, NY and Philly are going to let you have it. Because those cities have real fans. Not exclusive to Boston@TheNBACentral This would be a grand slam for the warriors.  Kuminga has potential, but needs a lot of development.  Wiseman isn’t even playing so any value in return for him is a win.  And Anunoby is a proven talent who would fill a huge need for golden state.@warriors @KlayThompson You are the key to win.

Play #2: Celtics 3Q -0.5
2nd Half Celtics [Spread]

Good luck folks!!!
#NBA #GamblingTwitterTwo Plays for tonight:

I see the Golden State Warriors starting fast tonight , despite the Steph Curry injury. I also think Klay has a better game. 

Warriors finally win a first half tonight... 

Play #1: 1st Half Golden State +2

That said... I firmly believe in the...TONIGHT the Warriors try to even the NBA Finals in Game 4 against the Celtics. Golden State had just 11 points in the fourth quarter of Boston's 116-100 Game 3 win, its lowest playoff total since the first frame of Game 6 in the 2016 Finals versus Cleveland. https://t.co/ZhWRD0IvMJ@bansky No, although this whole series is shaping up quite nicely for @StephenCurry30 , tbh. The @warriors don't necessarily have to win tonight. The @celtics need that 3-1 lead, but there won't be any stains on @jaytatum0 or @FCHWPO after this series. win/lose.@ScharffReece69 @warriors Good point...we were down by 16 point in the first half at one point. That can't happen in game 4.@LordDOMS @KlayThompson @warriors @celtics 🤷🏾‍♂️Fuck gets bleed. Shit doesn’t.

I needs one…@p_lo @warriors It’s over. Tonight it ends 3-1 Boston in 6@AG_NBA_ @jacksettleman @warriors Jordan Poole 30+ pts (+6000) is a great value play imo. Especially if Steph isn’t playing at 100%. He has 11 career 30pt games. 

For reference, Steph 60+ pts and Tatum 60+ pts are the same odds (+6000). They each only have one career 60pt game.@durantmuse @warriors Durant still got swept@j3goat3 @warriors fair@stephenasmith sir I don't know if you'll ever read this or not but I will say this the Boston Celtics will beat the Golden State warriors in six games tonight Boston Celtics will win they'll go back to the warriors The warriors will win they'll come back in game 6 and win@cryptoplatkin @jacksettleman @warriors I worry he's not 100% he's so up and down with his health...Allowed this clown to go all in for the @warriors for the #nbafinals since today is his 12th birthday.

Is @DDDGURU's biggest concern valid and what can Golden State do about it? https://t.co/Yhp1IB84SM@warriors @StephenCurry30 
Warriors start  Kuminga in place of Looney. Kuminga gives Warriors more defensive &amp; offensive Versatility. Put Kuminga on Jaylen Brown.

Kuminga gives Warriors a guy who can switch 1-5 &amp; provide better spacing on offense@warriors Will Dray play like a DPOY or like a rookie? Will Kerr continue to be outcoached in the 4th Qtrs? Will he continue to put in bad lineups &amp; bench the hot hands? Why is Looney on minutes restriction when Boston is feasting on the boards? Why is Kuminga &amp; Moody parked on the bench?@TomYrad @celtics @warriors @985TheSportsHub One of them did exactly that to Lebron, so, yea. ok.@JohnBaptist1099 @warriors @957thegame @ESPNRadio @betwayusa Draymond can do better, Thompson can score, and steph is good to play.

 3 things to watch for in Game 4 of NBA Finals

1. Celtics will test Steph Curry’s creaky foot early and often

2. Is Jaylen Brown the Warriors’ biggest problem?

3. Grant Williams is playing his way back into the mix https://t.co/EaquQN6MIt@nationsgr8test @DogSurfRoadshow @warriors Totally agree! I fully expect us to bounce back with big performances from multiple guys today. 

Make it 2-2 after tonight and you’re right, it’s just best of 3, with home courtHow about @ESPNNBA talk about what really happened in game 3 between @warriors and @celtics. Huge FTA and personal foul calls in favor of Celtics. Game officiated by @OfficialNBARefs Scott Foster. Not surprised this guy is a game wrecker pushing NBA’s agenda. #NBAFinals2022 https://t.co/D94mNE7Nsn@warriors Please we need this win so badly@NBAIndia @MTVIndia @NickIndia @Sports18 @Vh1India @OfficialJioTV @VootSelect @StephenCurry30 @warriors @KlayThompson Is it in English on @Vh1India or just video without sound on it??

Warriors need to Take Looney out starting lineup &amp; start Kuminga &amp; put him on Jaylen Brown. Kuminga can defend multiple positions on Defense &amp; can space the floor on defense.

#NBAFinals2022Opinion | If the Celtics win tonight and get a 3-1 lead on the Golden State Warriors, will the Warriors fight back to win the series and avenge their blown 3-1 lead against the Cavaliers in 2016? If so, is that bad news for Joe Biden? It’s complicatedLet’s get this win tonight @warriors so “the show” isn’t the major storyline. #NBAFinals https://t.co/Bi1kFHtsKdKevon Looney compared the chippiness of the 2022 NBA Finals to some of Golden State’s past battles.

The Golden State Warriors select Curry with the 7th pick in the NBA Draft. Curry just wrapped up a 3-year career at Davidson College, where he wore Nike shoes.

He also had a family connection to the company: his Godfather worked at Nike. https://t.co/NeCicGieIV@CelticssUp @warriors WE AINT GOING DOWN WE GOING UP@johnewing @JoeyMurr @warriors @BetMGM I love the Celtics but the degen in me would drop the $500 if I was in Vegas  for the 😓 as well.@warriors if y’all thought Wednesday was something.

"Right now the Celtics are playing 5 against 4 vs Golden State. The toughest decision the Warriors have to make is whether to sit Draymond...He's hurting them." https://t.co/omh6JcasS8@mikeaintjokin @_b0y1da_ @OnBallSteph man what, do even know what "NEED" means?😭. If the Warriors get any other all star besides KD, they still go to the finals atleast 1 more time. While if KD doesn't go to Golden State and he might've retired ringless. That's not them "equally" needing each other is it?@jorgoat23better @warriors Years@ButcherBoy415 @957thegame @warriors @ButcherBoy415 Do you think they should switch and put Wiggins on brown and Draymond on Tatum?

@warriorsWhat happened to this take from @KlayThompson 
Lol yall soft.. one loss and yall handle it like a bunch of poor sports. @warriors  and I quote "hypocrites the lot of you." Really politics  isn't for you... stay to basketball. https://t.co/lsOFirywFw2022 NBA Playoffs – The Golden State Warriors aren’t giving up their dynasty yet https://t.co/nBoqEa4ypV#267Hoops PODCAST 🏀 

@Celtics lead the series 2-1 in the ongoing 2022 #NBAFinals. @Warriors are still on the road in Boston for Game 4. 

On this episode we catch up with Basketball Player, Thato Tema ahead of Game 4. 
 
#267HoopsPodcast #NBA @NBA https://t.co/2A4AtnHlCa@cmkdoesbball @warriors Okay my reply doesn’t makes sense, cause I always view g7s as the ‘do or die’ game kkkkkkk

So yepp, tomorrow’s game is critical 🥶Imma end my night with wine and this Boston &amp; Golden State game...come on Warriors we need this W@PirateSoda @warriors Curry’s ankles are fragile than others people’sChristian County’s old student section would eat the @warriors alive #cryDraymond green is shitty…. Put kuminga in! @warriors@itaorixxx @warriors I feel like if we go down 3-1, we can't bear this celtics team 3 in a row@ClutchPointsApp @warriors Warriors need all help. Game 4 klay, Poole, and Wiggins need to show up? https://t.co/uzvJRKHMY7On this date in 1980, the Golden State Warriors select Joe Barry Carroll with the first overall pick in the 1980 NBA draft. Woooooooooo! #Celtics https://t.co/TcmXX0MmSjIn 12 hours the @warriors play their biggest game of the year, and possibly one of the biggest games in this storied franchise’s history.

What’s even crazier is that Game 5 might be more significant. #DubNation’s wild ride continues on. https://t.co/RkiCU1jZD4can’t wait to get this win tonight! 

@warriors in 6!@cmkdoesbball @warriors Well, it really is. 

What I mean is, it’s g4 and it’s not that ‘critical’ yet??We’re back!

@mitch_the_quick is on vacation, @aaron___carter is back in Chicago, and the Finals are in full swing. The boys do a recap of Games 1-3, how good the @celtics look, and how the @warriors should adjust. They also talk flawed 2000s Finals Champs https://t.co/yjBngcny2UBig game for the @warriors tonight, not a must win imo but they probably would rather not go down 1-3. Thoughts? Are you rooting for @warriors or @celtics ? **or don’t care haha My @SpaceRiders_NFT just wants to watch a competitive game!! Would love to get to game 7 #NBAFinals https://t.co/YHxd31tX5eI need the whole @warriors team to look at this thread so they can stop crying😂😭 https://t.co/0YN0Bg9RdzI dislike the Golden State Warriors and have for a long time!

This is one reason @warriors going to lose he care what ppl think@DerekJ789 @CIMTHOG2 @warriors Don't be a hypocrite. Cause the warriors had game 2 with the refs cheating the whole game. We didn't get any free throws when it was supposed to be called. We didn't bitch or complain. We played the game, we lost game 2 and bounced back game 3. Warriors need to stop whining.@warriors Sending positive vibes from the East Coast.

Limit Poole’s time, replace his minutes with Otto, GP2, Lonny’s minutes.In the first NBA Finals game at the TD Garden since 2010, the Boston Celtics bullied the Golden State Warriors in the paint to take a series-defining win at home and earn a 2-1 lead.

Warriors win in 6 games!
Curry MVP finals!@emullaney83 @warriors @rob_williamsIII Based on your experiences with GSW, this surprises me none. I bet you hate Draymond even more than I do 🙄@calistyle510 @warriors @StephenCurry30 I don’t believe so. There’s always hope until it’s officially over. N it’s not officially over. Nothing can or will change my mind until I see it for myself. N if so they still made it to the champion ship. Everybody thought the Bucks was going . But look what happen.@Roger_fan123 @DogSurfRoadshow @warriors They drew two fouls on RW on drives (both were questionable calls too) but Wiggins had one drive-and-kick at RW while OPJ had two.  The biggest misgiving is when Dray sits there waiting beyond the arc.  He needs to cut and attack without the ball.So really what the @warriors are asking the @celtics to do is to not dive on any lose balls, no sudden movements towards any player with a ball in his hand…                                              https://t.co/b1C9OuTb5Y@teakbucki62 @warriors @rob_williamsIII As much as I can’t believe it, I’m definitely pulling for your C’s@DogSurfRoadshow @OnBallSteph @warriors i wrote them off after game 1 so…Golden State Warriors star Stephen Curry says there's no doubt that he'll play in Game 4 of the NBA Finals against Boston. The two-time NBA MVP injured his ankle late in Game 3. Boston won 116-100 to take a 2-1… https://t.co/dL5ygfNbj4@Roger_fan123 @DogSurfRoadshow @warriors After their first stint to start the game, Draymond should not be in the game when RW is on the floor.  Dray should still get between 28-32 min.  With Looney in the game, he's a better rebounder and can play in the dunker's spot and be a threat.@thejeffgomez71 @DogSurfRoadshow @warriors I felt they had success when they attacked Rob will a few times last night, even though he blocked a few shots. 

Got to put him and horford in as many pick n rolls as possible- not only with Steph but do Wiggins as well. 

What do you think of Draymond on brown now?as a die hard New York Rangers and Golden State Warriors fan I've never been more sports stressed in my life@DDDGURU @warriors I'm right with ya Gu.....look I pray I'm wrong but last night was weird. But then again Boston has looked great then terrible every other game the last 2 rounds. Who knows manCeltics HC Ime Udoka’s legendary NSFW message to Boston that saved them from Game 3 collapse vs. Warriors #GSW #Dubs #GoldenState #LetsGoWarriors https://t.co/brtUdPZzJ0@DrGuru_ @mevvybear @downbadbears @HanaHoops @KlayForTrey you guys mark my words the golden state warriors will win 3 straight and close Boston on TD Garden on Thursday June 16, if Miami son 2 against them why can’t golden state do the same.
Please react to my tweet!The Miami Heat are finalizing a trade to send OG Anunoby to the golden state warriors@cuddyron @p_lo @warriors ratio@anthonyVslater @warriors is playing nice and little soft. I think they need to respond to Celtics physicality. Draymond is the only one fighting back. Warriors all the way!@warriors @KlayThompson When winners lose they admit and come back stronger, when loser loses they got tonnes of reasons. This is why GSW is so much respectable.@torch_stock @jkiddmagsy @p_lo @warriors ratio@PatMcAfeeShow Imagine the @celtics and @warriors brawling like that at the end of there games.🤣@Celt_Ike @jerkdigler @warriors This whole klay thing and Kerr thing bout being classy lol it's really strick a nerve with me when u have warrior fans making threats it's like opinions are one thing and chanting is one thing but threats are over the line ya knowBOSTON HOLDS AT HOME | #CHASINGHISTORY | NBA Finals Game 3 #GoldenState #Warriors #NBA Video: https://t.co/4BEtDT3yAU@Roger_fan123 @DogSurfRoadshow @warriors Draymond does have to play better but I don't think he can bring it as consistently so that's where more Loon and OPJ would help.   Can't lose the paint on both ends and need to go right at RW with more drive and kicks.@Roger_fan123 @DogSurfRoadshow @warriors The over-help happened again last night.  The two quick fouls on Curry hurt bc it allowed BOS to attack him relentlessly.  I'd layoff and let him shoot from deep.  On off, Williams doesn't even guard Dray and RW covers more ground than just about any other defender in the NBA.@DDDGURU @warriors Let’s just let game four play out, then assess the situation. Boston might be in trouble. I know the Warriors can play better than they played in game three. I can’t see Boston playing much better than they played in game 3. Shot their best shot? Now the Dubs have to be better.Colorado Avalanche

New York Rangers 2-3 Tampa Bay Lightning

Boston Celtics 2-1 Golden State Warriors@thejeffgomez71 @DogSurfRoadshow @warriors I feel exactly the same way with your last point. Anytime Williams is in, you have to get Dray out of there and loon in. I think even OPJ got cooked by him a few times, but zero doubt, he should be in way more. 

When will they stop over helping man and giving up so many 3s@NYRangers acting like the @warriors right now. Looks like @justinbieber will be playing in msg next weekGolden State Warriors guard Stephen Curry told reporters on Thursday that he expects to play in Game 4 of the NBA Finals against the Boston Celtics on Friday night at TD Garden.
https://t.co/5V3Sg8ibEc@celtics @NBA @FirstTake @NBAonTNT @Espngreeny @ESPNNBA @warriors I really need Boston to stop diving on players legs with your body … the ball ain’t Steph’s Ankles!!!  it was a body roll
Really Al … the was dirty! And y’all should say it!@sandragcanada1 @DeVontaSmith_6 @warriors Letting them play = Cs win@Roger_fan123 @DogSurfRoadshow @warriors Nothing has really surprised me so far other than Kerr not playing GP2 in G1 - which cost them the game.  A little surprised that Warriors haven't had a counter for R.Williams when they knew he'd be key.  Loon and OPJ need to play more and less of Dray.Ahead of Game 4 of the #NBAFinals vs the @warriors, @celtics superstar @FCHWPO revealed why this playoff run has been ‘so special’ for him

#AllAbout18 #DubNation https://t.co/y06BYlaxMC@Roger_fan123 @DogSurfRoadshow @warriors They blitz/trap Curry more and they get off to bad starts.  They can't get stops and turn into a jump-shooting team.  I knew R.Williams would be the diff.  Need to negate him by not having Dray on the floor at the same time.  Defensively... they might need Iggy for a few.@Kdiesel4u @BaoBOYMIX @warriors wiseman was it.@tdtamarack91 @DogSurfRoadshow @NBA @LockedOnDubs @warriors So true. It’s sad.

They soft... especially @Money23Green 
What a cry baby hypocrite.. the lot of all of em, but especially  him.It seems like a good time to point out that the Golden State Warriors have won at least 1 road Playoff game in 26 straight series.  I’m not saying I’m backing the Warriors with a bet in Game 4, but it might be a nice “contrarian” play. I’ll sleep on it.  #Trendz #NBAFinals@withluvselena @warriors @KlayThompson Except your lost as it is. Game 2 warrior refs were cheating like crazy and wasn't making any foul calls through the whole 4  quarters for the Celtics. We didn't complain like big ass babies. 
It's basketball.@StephenCurry30 &amp; @KlayThompson Y’all need to find a way to play 48 mins because every time one of y’all get on fire and on a rhythm, Kerr gives you a rest, and that’s is when the Celtics take advantage. Splash Brothers, Dubs need you!!!!!! @warriors #NBAFinals@warriors @KlayThompson Y’all playing 5 on 3 offensive basketball. Not beating Celtics that way ask the Heat and Nets.@ESPNNBA 15 points and 15 personal fouls, so how about fire this guy next year? @warriors🏀 Game 4: #Celtics 🆚 #Warriors 

Will Boston extend their lead or can Golden State tie things up?🤨
