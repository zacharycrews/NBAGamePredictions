I work with the public, didn’t take any time off directly related to the pandemic. You get tested when you feel sick. Pharmacists, the mailman, and the manager at your grocery store don’t get tested every day, why do athletes need to?@Ryan_Celticsfan @HornetsPR @ashahahmadi @hornets @NBA Yea but that's not based on science.

Can’t start stagnant@hornets @sam_perley @LendingTree 1) Can not let Ayton get any sort of rhythm in the post like Nurkic did early (luckily he was in foul trouble)

2) The paint disparity leads to over helping.   That almost certainly results in a wide open 3.  It will turn into a shootout quick if that happensDon't forget to check out today's Hornets Hive Cast!

Or Minnesota Lakers to LA Fakers. 

Like, how is this acceptable?!@Ataqoz @Tilly70 Nah.. the Pelicans are a rather irrelevant NBA team.  There's not a strong basketball culture in New Orleans and the only got the team out of dumb luck when Charlotte Hornets owner George Shinn couldn't get an arena.
