@NBABig loss by the Nets. Getting interesting in the Eastern Conference. 

Fall 119 to 110 to the Hornets. 

The Nets are now the ninth seed in the East. 

#NBA @ATLHawks #Forever404 #Hawks #AtlantaHawks #TruetoAtlantaI get the names Timothée Chalamet and Timothé Luwawu-Cabarrot mixed up, so sometimes I think of a 6’7” 220-pound bench forward for the Atlanta Hawks when someone is actually talking about a hauntingly pale actor who weighs about the same as one of TLC’s arms.Thank you, @ATLHawks https://t.co/WQwfTwFcOuplease cut to Michael Gross in the audience wearing an Atlanta Hawks hat🏀 Atlanta Hawks (@ATLHawks) #TrueToAtlanta

New item $6.99My thoughts on the g-league are simple. If any and everybody can put up 25-30 pts every game. That means you basically watching a Allstar game. Not a lick of defense . But I hear what you saying though🤣😂🤣nah I don’t….. @ATLHawks@GameplanChicago @ATLHawks @sportslogosnet @UniWatch @PhilHecken Why did they tilt the logo?@TrolledByChase Atlanta Hawks in a nutshell@Mark_J_Boyle @ATLHawks “69 Cincinnati Royals come to mind.https://t.co/JErcyUx9aV
