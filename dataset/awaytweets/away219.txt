@Davedaviddave12 @SacramentoKings @Chimezie_Metu You said Gobert was a good perimeter defender 😂😂 and now you saying Nurkic is a bad one when he finished top 10 in defensive rating 😂 . 

Nurkic is an above average to elite interior defender and moves his feet well for a big. You embarrassed yourself on this one bud@moe_harkless @bubblegumkids_ Wen @bubblegumkids_ hitting a @SacramentoKings game?! I’ll gladly hop on a plane and head out west to see these see these “Kings” do their thing ✊🏻 https://t.co/PEqxCbEUgj@SacramentoKings @hbarnes @swipathefox @TyHaliburton22 @TerenceDavisJr Watching from Stockton

He doesn’t hesitate like he knows it’s probably going in. If he can shoot 40% from 3 he’s going to be a star.@VizedYY @SacramentoKings @Chimezie_Metu He’s so long tho, and can jump. Not many bigs I can think of boding dude besides like towns and AD. But Metu can also take those dudes outside the paint on other end.

@SacramentoKings : Buddy Hield is lost. Fox should be a legit star. Haliburton should be next in line. Bagley has only played twice this season. Davion Mitchell should find the nearest exit@BerlageJack I think so but other companies have lost their naming rights early because of financial issues.

#Betting #FreePicks https://t.co/3BuDHv0BlZNBA Rumors: Should Sacramento Kings Consider De'Aaron Fox Trade? - NBA Analysis Network https://t.co/1pQmjcugd8@SacramentoKings @TyHaliburton22 @ankr Looks like #lazyheroesNFT on his shoe🔥@SacramentoKings @ankr @TyHaliburton22 👀👀👀 @theycallmedelph ANKR@SacramentoKings please do not trade to get 76ers Ben Simmons. Really don’t think he makes the team better. #JustOnePersonsThoughts@Davedaviddave12 @SacramentoKings @Chimezie_Metu Ooooh idk about the 5, I like him at the 4. He’s smooth with it too. Maybe some sets at the 5 could work but he will get bodied by stronger bigs@ThinkingCrypto1 People that laughed at us in 2017...2018.   They are shocked right now.  This arena is not the Sacramento Kings home, it's the LA Lakers!   BTW- Dub Nation feels great Warriors beating Nets.  😁@187christ187 @SacramentoKings @Chimezie_Metu Metu can shoot and protect rim.  idt jones would be better than Holmes. But kings fans should be ecstatic about their team now since Metu looks like a star.@VizedYY @SacramentoKings @Chimezie_Metu He looks nice. Ain’t going to lie. Perfect size for a center too. Kings might be on to something now. His jumper looks really good. That should open up paint for fox and tyrese now they can stretch defense with 5 shooters, and have a rim protector in. Fox tyrese Barnes buddy metu@ChrisMp33 @SacramentoKings I think since Metu looks like an up and coming star, they are more of a complete team. Really deep too.@jickbog @SacramentoKings Idk, at least he’s playing Metu big mins, that was a surprise. He looks really good. Ideal skills for an all star center in this league too.@playersonlynft Still undecided 🤷🏼‍♂️ the art work is dope on all the teams. Need to get some @SacramentoKings up in here I rock with them! @TyHaliburton22 @hbarnes@LucaKassab @mikebibbycom @MarkJackson13 @SacramentoKings You’ve always been one of the highest IQ guards in the program. Some things never change 🙏🏾11/16/99 - Vancouver held Sacramento to just 32% shooting and only 13p in the 4Q, but still could not overcome the Kings, as the #Grizzlies (3-4 and 59-244 all-time) fell 81-77 on the road, the start of an 11-game losing streak. @ShareefAbdur_R: 24p/18r. Othello: 22p/12r. https://t.co/IJZX0USxd6@LakersTakes @hmfaigen Luol Deng's cap space has waived its no-trade clause in order to assist the @Lakers &amp; @SacramentoKings in smoothing the way forward!     Former Kings GM Vlade Divac is said to be working the phones with former Lakers Executive, Earvin "Magic" Johnson!He’s going to the Sacramento Kings https://t.co/1I7NNQd5HpThis name might be worse than Sleep Train Arena for the @SacramentoKings https://t.co/atk5QDB2d5Sacramento Kings:@LucaKassab Man… where is @mikebibbycom at? I want him or @MarkJackson13 as the @SacramentoKings next head coach. Or Both!!!@ken_triglia @DrLydecia @Rich_Holmes22 @SacramentoKings @momoragan @DeuceMason It wasn’t easy to find, but find it, I did. Here is a side-by-side comparison of the original picture and the art that the amazing @ken_triglia created, based on the original picture. Now that they appear together, in the same tweet, I wan to now see what you all think of them.🤝 https://t.co/VRdcTNYdKa@momoragan @DeuceMason @SacramentoKings @StocktonKings Yeah, I agree.😏 Come on, Deuce!!😞 You know better!!🤨 Am I going to have to tell Judy?🤔 https://t.co/ahRF7aPe2YAs a @SacramentoKings fan living in Miami at the time I still loved this guy and the @MiamiHEAT:

Can’t be moving that for younger development pieces.  Already went all in with Tobias contract, gotta keep that same energy.Starting QB for the Sacramento Kings, Tyrese Haliburton https://t.co/h4jtuin0SbI hope @SacramentoKings @Vivek does something like this. https://t.co/LK8gGfhV77@CorporateKennys Noooo THAT was no auto pilot buddy…He had to be movin the yoke all over the place to keep us level and on the right decent…We were bein tossed around like Shaq tossin Sacramento Kings offa himRemember when the Sacramento Kings played in an arena named after a rubber bracelet with a magnet inside of it?Yo @TyHaliburton22 !
