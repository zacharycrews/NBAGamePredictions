@lozcast was full of praise for Jimmy Buckets ahead of the Miami's trip to Utah tonight 🎷

Watch the Heat @ Jazz unfold tonight on Sky Sports Mix at 10PM 📺 https://t.co/Gr4IahMnjG@raf_dodo @MiamiHEAT The climate weather , the city.state  party culture trumps more than you thinkAnalyzing Saturday’s Miami Heat at Utah Jazz odds and lines, with NBA expert picks, predictions and best bets.  https://t.co/vE8LtrpX2D@Cavs_House @MiamiHEAT Heat is a free agent hotspot because of it’s culture. I know about the draft I got some homeboys that you will hear about in the draft in five years@MiamiHEAT any tickets🎟🎟 for the OKC game on Monday???🙏🏼🙏🏼 https://t.co/0xWBMn1ENK@xThugginItx @MiamiHEAT You’re a lifer@yogishastri @MiamiHEAT He cheap shotted Nikola Jokic, kneeing him and elbowing him at the same time while he was making a pass and didn't even try to be subtle. Jokic obviously didn't like that and laid him out with a savage elbow tackle in the back. Literally sent him flying lmao@MiamiHEAT I’m in Idaho and thinking about it. Except last time I was there for a Heat game a Jazz fan sucker punched me in my Dwade jersey. Lol

Sucker puncher lost tho@MiamiHEAT The Jazz and the Heat are my two favorite teams, but if the @MiamiHEAT hook me up with a ticket before the @utahjazz do I’ll root for the Heat tonight 😏@MiamiHEAT I’m watching the canes today. 🙌🏼@raf_dodo @MiamiHEAT Cleveland is not a free agent hotspot...but i dont expect a euro fan to understand this@MiamiHEAT NBA: Miami Heat, the team has a deficit in the tall-players category...needs adjustment, I think? Get it done, as time is fleeting. Ought not be content with two, or three players...an entire roster of competent players are needed, backup in each department.@MiamiHEAT Must winOnly 1 game interests me and that's @MiamiHEAT vs @utahjazz@hayderade208 @MiamiHEAT maybe my quote tweet photo circa 2012 will do the trickIt's that time again where three South Florida teams play on the same day!

Not great, in my eyes5 NBA teams have 2 players averaging 20+ points. Only 1 has 3 averaging 20+ — the Miami Heat with Butler, Herro and Adebayo.@djgenius21 @ClipperNation16 @MiamiHEAT Which g leaguers?Los Angeles Lakers head coach Frank Vogel praised the team for hitting 3s in the win against the Miami Heat.  https://t.co/iy2EUWY7pa@TheNBACentral @_Talkin_NBA 4 of those guys played for @MiamiHEAT@FTX_Official @TomBrady @giseleofficial @StephenCurry30 @Trevorlawrencee @MLB @kevinolearytv @LCSOfficial @MiamiHEAT @riotgames @TSM join $elon to mars! #dogelon #dogelonmars@alanysrodri_ I know I’m not in your league but shit, if you viewing this at least just know I’m going to the @MiamiHEAT playoffs games in Miami because I got full faith we will make it, I get two tickets every year to go with my boyz, lemme take u instead.

Glad I sat Gaskins on Miami.Yes, I know it's a day late, but oh well. 

Wide-open 3s, defensive breakdowns, and offense falling off at times. This is why the Miami Heat lost to the Los Angeles Lakers despite having a nine-point lead late in the fourth. #NBATwitter #SimplyBallin

Yeah, I have a feeling this will make the whole Enron thing with Houston look like child's play. Also, it's strange how both Florida NBA teams now have stadiums named after pyramid schemes@exhoopsPRguy I saw a Video of him, talking about an old Miami Heat vs Chicago Bulls playoff game. I did not fact check it, but if the numbers shown were accurate he got the better of Jordan once. 😂 I thought he was calling UK games? Unless he needs money, that would be a dream gig. 🤷🏼‍♂️The Miami Heat, fresh off B2B losses in Staples Center, fly to SLC today, on the day between games (i.e. not last night after facing the Clippers). They will arrive roughly 22 hours before their Saturday afternoon matchup with the Jazz. https://t.co/u2jWr90lIHOne of the best Miami Heat Dunks on @nbatopshot. SN 699 for $5.
