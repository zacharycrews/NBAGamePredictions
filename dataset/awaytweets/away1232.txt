@CrumblCookies | #AllFly https://t.co/rPYwUCP9RsIm Also looking at how the Hawks will handle Charlotte's small ball lineup when PJ Washington is at the 5. I dont feel great about having Gallo out there in those situations.

The Charlotte Hornets will feature in the play-in tournament for the 2nd year in a row.

Bet slip link: https://t.co/3I0rSeuuzp https://t.co/8pYOys5j1H@hornets @BankofAmerica Pay this man.Despite finishing the season 43-39 with a 3-game winning streak, the Hornets got a little unlucky. As a No. 10 seed, Charlotte needs to win two play-in games to make the playoffs for the first time in six years.

https://t.co/ipRl2WoHPbThe #Hornets playoff fate comes down to tonight. Will Charlotte continue its play-in run or will the team's first winning season since 2016 end out of the postseason?

Traditionally speaking Charlotte has been pretty good at slowing down Young, but not necessarily Atlanta. More than ever this game will be a test of Young's ability to produce Ws, not just stats. Backing in ATL's experience here after last year's run.
