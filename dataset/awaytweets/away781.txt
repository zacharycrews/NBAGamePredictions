Not offense. JB is a better off ball player offensively than Tatum. He’s a better cutter/better at relocating. But he’s significantly worse on ball.

Not to mention Tatum is third in the entire NBA in defensive win shares, and 1st among forwards. https://t.co/JncjfVMRLR@kirkgoldsberry @celtics @Suns @nuggets @dallasmavs @Timberwolves @Lakers @warriors @BrooklynNets @chicagobulls @utahjazz This is a crazy one@Money_Co_Blamo @NBA @celtics @NBATV It’s not about your preference. People are always apt to take the guy who’s the better on ball defender but that does NOT mean he’s more impactful. It’s just a more flashy style of defense, getting nice 1v1 stops. It’s team oriented defense where brown struggles.@travisrohrig @celtics That's true fandom going to that length!😂 I'll def tag you on any more errors I see on it this year lol@jsecher @celtics exactly@Money_Co_Blamo @NBA @celtics @NBATV It’s not about what happens in a blue moon. Tatum is a more consistently impactful defender because his defense isn’t completely reliant on getting a 1v1 stop. JB is constantly lapsing on defense.This leaves Richaun Holmes and Harrison Barnes in question. Lets get them on the squad @celtics https://t.co/4NVz0LdL4B@kirkgoldsberry @celtics @Suns @nuggets @dallasmavs @Timberwolves @Lakers @warriors @BrooklynNets @chicagobulls @utahjazz Celtics on a roll!

It’s the damn Pistons coming off a b2b. Don’t blow @celtics@HoopsEmpire_ @NBA @celtics @NBATV Brown is not trash offball. last season his points was more off. His weakness last year was passing while tatums last year was switches. This year brown isnt slashing as good and tatum has bad shot selection. But as for off ball brown is used more there. less usage than tatum.@Jetstriar @celtics @johnsap25 @Mr_MikeNice @MarvTV_ The Walker wiggle. This team is a mix of legends and distinguished short timers. I agree with you Walker was the man for awhile but Pierce’s career overshadows him. At the time, my kids wanted Walker jerseys, not Pierce.@HoopsEmpire_ @NBA @celtics @NBATV Im not saying tatum cant defend but i take the star willing to take on the defensive matchup of the star while hes averaging 25. having to create defense and offense with the rules of today helps his case too. Imo brown and tatum could average 27 ppg with 2stl 1bl together.Let's freaking go Admiral!! Dude has been lighting it up lately in Lakeland!! Really really hope he gets another legit chance for more than just a 10 day contract at the NBA level orrr @celtics could make a trade and reunite him and @Grant2Will just saying PB&amp;J is a great mix🤷‍♂️🤔 https://t.co/3JQLkJJePbfeel like the Boston Celtics jerseys bc they’re just like, eh https://t.co/YicFrwS5StBoston Celtics play basketball today@HoopsEmpire_ @NBA @celtics @NBATV Jaylen is better on switches and isnt weak downlow against bigs.guys like robert williams and horford are great help defenders and rim protectors. last year tatum was running the 4 mostly and last year there paint defense sucked. This year there offense sucks.🤷🏿‍♂️@HoopsEmpire_ @NBA @celtics @NBATV No im talking based on this season if you decide that this season shouldnt count as a measuring stick then so be it. But you arent really giving me reasons tatum is better. And im takking about patterns not just something that happens once in a blue moonI leave the game that love.

Sorry, but I'm gone.

I'm history.

I dedicated my life to basketball.

And I dedicated my life to the Boston Celtics.

Good night, Boston.

However that’s because he’s quicker. Tatum can guard 1-4 pretty much but he’s just a bit slower than brown. But his defensive IQ is elite. He’s so good off ball, at recovery, just general defensive intelligence.@Jetstriar @celtics @johnsap25 @Mr_MikeNice @MarvTV_ @ruslodi @jaytatum0 @Bam1of1 Agree! But here’s another snub https://t.co/LCUs9RG01V@gladimymathieu @Grant2Will @celtics @NBA Very similar playing style and personal stats, but one is a top team in the east, the other may not even make the playoffs.

#brighttu #f4thyme #f4gorya #f4thailand https://t.co/jVEJf5tmli@Money_Co_Blamo @NBA @celtics @NBATV Your talking about specific things you have seen when you decide to watch Celtics games. I have not missed a single minute of their entire careers. Tatums defense is better. JB is better on ball but ABYSMAL off ball. Tatum is good on ball and elite off ball. It’s not just size.@Money_Co_Blamo @NBA @celtics @NBATV I mean Tatum has clamped plenty of players. Not sure what you want me to tell you…you want like actual examples? Demar derozan is one. Clamped him in the last couple minutes and the Celtics won because he clamped him on the GW attempt.You hear that? @BrooklynNets @warriors @ATLHawks @Timberwolves @nuggets @DetroitPistons @PelicansNBA @memgrizz @Suns @MiamiHEAT @Bucks @trailblazers @SacramentoKings @cavs @celtics @nyknicks @dallasmavs @HoustonRockets @utahjazz @okcthunder @OrlandoMagic @Raptors https://t.co/4IEfx0C44M@Money_Co_Blamo @NBA @celtics @NBATV Yeah that’s just not true.

Bill Sharman coached the Lakers to the 1972 title. Parish won a title with the Bulls. So what?
