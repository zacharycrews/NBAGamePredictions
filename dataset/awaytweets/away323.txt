(+)If the @hornets can defeat the reigning NBA Champs tonight ..... I’m buying Sloppy Steaks for everyone!!!@sammydixon23 @hornets @GEICO @T_Rozzay3 Glad I’m not the only one who doesn’t like terry Having the ball 80% of the game@hornets @greensboroswarm When will you bring @LiAngeloBall to the hornets? 👀👀👀Kicking off 25 days of #Christmas with former Charlotte #Hornets beloved point guard No. 1, Muggsy Bogues (1988-96, 97)! Being the shortest player ever to play in the NBA at 5’3 never stopped him from being great! #NBA #NC #HappyHolidays #AllFly https://t.co/7NibQM5AKtThe Milwaukee Bucks will put their seven-game win steak on the line against the Charlotte Hornets tonight and @omgbradshaw picked out three things to watch against a team that has given them trouble. #FearTheDeer https://t.co/9y9pmTlas2@hornets Miles foul shooting and 3 pointers are off it seems and he's missing bunnies lately. Maybe he isn't worth the 60 mil. That he turned down if it means we can get a elite center thats tough good and pure meanDasHaus made a bet!

#sportsbetting #betting #sportspicks #gamblingtwitter #gambling@hornets Our coach insists on Washington playing but his defensive effort is poor as well as rebounding. Nick Richard's should be starting and playing much more minutes. Cody being sick crushed us Monday. He darn sure needs to be starting bc of defense and hustle alone. We win last gameDasHaus made a bet!

I said LA should try their *absolute hardest* to see if Oubre is available. I do agree that Charlotte doesn’t really need THT, but it’s worth a try imo. I think trading for Grant would be just as hard@hornets @greensboroswarm What are the chances that he will play in the game?  No chance will be given by borrego who is obsessed with playing small ball.@hornets @GEICO @T_Rozzay3 I see no chance for hornets win against bucks when they have Giannis lurking to drive to the basket. It is on borrego and especially Kupchak for not bringing any credible centre in the off season."INJURY UPDATE: Al Jefferson's MRI today confirmed @hornets initial diagnosis of a …"
