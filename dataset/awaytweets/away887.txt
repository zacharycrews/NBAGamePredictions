Strengths:
- Elite mid-range game
- Tremendous depth
- Low turnover offense feeds into swarming half court defense
- Precise execution on both ends
- Def have the clutch gene@its_khaleel @Suns Before I read the article I saw the title and thought of that Kendrick Lamar song. Great read!@_Graysonblazer @NBAAllStar @NBA @Suns "Take you lil boys back to the class room" i'm done😂😂😂😂Early NBA Leans :

Growing up in Australia, we got basketball once a week on a Saturday morning. Everyone followed the Lakers, Celtics and Bulls, didn’t want to follow the pack and then saw highlights of KJ on Inside the NBA and the Top 10 countdown. Never flinched since.@angelinams112 @Suns Portland and Seattle too.@angelinams112 @Suns My dad. Born and raised in Phx and now in my 40's. Used to stay up late, (not do my homework.

Lopez and now ibaka will be both on the court next time. Just like Lopez manhandled your whole team in the finals 😂 shit ain’t sweet around here 😂That's the importance of mid range game. Good job Phoenix Suns🌅@SportsStuff89 @TakeNoteJayy @Suns Sure bud. 🤦‍♂️Congratulations to Nemi (@marknemi), sarcastronaut and treehousebandit who moved up to take #7, #8 and #9 on the Phoenix Suns team leaderboard.

So Suns naturally became my favorite team/born in AZ@NBAAllStar @Suns “Then they said ‘Lakers in 6’” 😂Heartbreak hotel for @Waspbasketball, as Al McCoy of the Phoenix Suns Radio Network would say.

Buy a ticket to the fair and get free admission to the Suns' games.Phoenix Suns won't see CP for 6-8 weeks. He was putting up amazing numbers, MVP stuff for Suns. Now will be a good time to test Suns core, which I believe is very solid.
