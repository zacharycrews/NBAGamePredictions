Great matchup for Ayton. Not only the matchup but he should be the top offensive option today with the Suns missing Cam Johnson today.Deandre Ayton is so important for the Phoenix Suns, Robert Williams III is him for the Celtics (on their mid-tier level)

I'd love for the Lakers to develop a guy to be that given AD's injury woes.@DevinBookerMVP @Suns Go Phoenix Suns!!! Go Devin Booker!!!

Meanwhile the Suns play the winner of the 4/5 matchup, which is either Utah or Dallas. 

I love Phoenix’s odds to make outta the West…Most wins in the calendar year of 2022:

1) Phoenix Suns - 24
2) Dallas Mavericks - 22
T3) Boston Celtics - 21
T3) Memphis Grizzlies - 21@Suns Phoenix Suns you want to  win? 1. guard the 3pt. line make the extra pass,run and gun, and attack the rim, Ayton you can pull your weight  on the boards. Coach, give Bismack Biyombo  some minutes!3/6/75 – W/out Charlie Scott &amp; Dick Van Arsdale, the Phoenix #Suns still defeated the poor shooting Chicago Bulls 88-65, the lowest opponent points in franchise-history (tied on 4/1/03 versus Denver).

And yes, Rockets back to back

Plus the rise of Manchester United dibawah Opa FergieRavence was a land of devotion. They worshipped the Phoenix even though it had been a long five hundred suns since they last saw the Prophet. The Arohassin had warned him about the power of faith. But it wasn’t until now that Yassen had seen it and felt terrified by it.@lindseyrbhair 2,607th like #7 from our Phoenix Suns #22 Deandre Ayton!!!!

You’re a suns fan in PhoenixThe Phoenix Suns just won without CP3 and Booker and nobody in the West can stay within 8 games of them.

Um belo presente (sqn) https://t.co/AJ0iH5iguiIf GSW don’t have Dray for the beginning of the playoffs they might be cooked. With how easy the West is, that’s a free pass for Phoenix to the finals (if Nuggets aren’t completely healthy). With how hard the East is, whoever comes out is going to be very gassed. Suns NBA champs.AND THEY SAID WARRIORS WILL WIN THE WEST???
