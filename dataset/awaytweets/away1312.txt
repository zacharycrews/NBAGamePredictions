So I can go out and buy a shiny new gun@SP00KY_SQUIRREL @Fred53106254 @warriors So your response is to do nothing and put no laws into effect even if they have the possibility of stopping a couple mass shootings?

And don’t give me the usual “it’s a slippery slope…” bullshit. If you’re a responsible gun owner why wouldn’t you support that?@emilyweason @Buscusriot @seaside1776 @warriors Countries with non-existent mental health awareness aren’t always in the news for mass shootings.

Guns are not going to protect you for the government. We literally have the most powerful military on the planet. A rifle will not help you. Seems like if you’re scared of a powerful government, you’d support less military funding@ChrisCaine17 @SpillaneMj @WantGreatness @seaside1776 @warriors You know, you're on to something.

That's of course why ownership of many materials used to make bombs is illegal.

Now, let's do guns.@1440Coffee @warriors You’re misconstruing my words. God doesn’t cause anything bad in the world that is the devil which this world truly worships… unfazed by anyones words of hate I’m not being insensitive here I care just as much as everyone else about these murders@warriors No one is watching@tweeder530 @warriors There are broken people in every country.

@NBA https://t.co/xC6KBGfuEyI’ve never been a big NBA guy, but I can’t help but root for the Golden State Warriors. I respect the hell out of Steve Kerr.@tweeder530 @warriors How many mass shootings took place over the last ten days in Canada compared to the US? Restricting access to guns does have an impact.@dave_klopp @espn @Patrickqueen_ @warriors Gee I wonder where you align. I see you have the maturity/humor of a middle schooler based off your name. Trust we’re all laughing! Give us a minute to process such elite comedy.@warriors Are they willing to put their own desire for power before the American people? The answer is, an obvious and resounding, yes. They have shown us 288 times just this year! The answer will always be yes.Tonight's starting lineup https://t.co/PglPS4nXTp@SP00KY_SQUIRREL @warriors But these sick people currently can stroll into a gun store and purchase a weapon that can wipe out hundreds of lives in minutes with barely any checks@warriors Way to use this for your left wing politics.Well, close this thing out tonight @warriors. #DubNation@warriors #SteveKerr on another mass shooting in America. 🇺🇸 

https://t.co/DlJTBQ7sIr@MoneyKhash9 @warriors Mental Health is a global issue. Millions of Americans cope with those issues both diagnosed and undiagnosed on a daily basis. However millions of Americans are not shooting up schools, churches, and grocery stores. And this is not the case anywhere else in the “civilized” world.@warriors IT'S YOUR TYPE OF PASSION AND EMOTIONAL OUTCRY THAT NEEDS TO COME FROM EVERYONE. 

KEEP SPEAKING OUT. 

ENOUGH OF US CITIZENS WHO CHOOSE TO SIT ON THEIR ASS AND DO NOTHING; WHO CHOOSE TO VOTE IN REPUBLICAN MURDERS.Steve Kerr is the @nba coach of the Golden State Warriors. https://t.co/2rmiRoDJ15@moses_cobb @ThomDevine @warriors We have background checks when buying from federally licensed gun dealer. We have age restrictions. You don’t have to go through any other training for any other rights. You can drink a beer in an airport. Try taking a gun.@warriors NRA is too powerful. No amount of mass murders will change this fact. Sad day 😞@AliAdair22 @whynot98765 @warriors Same!@imthatguysammy @SWaisanen @the_dridge @warriors Yes. Let’s equate kids being murdered at schools than people falling. Makes sense.@CarlsenJersey @cheznico_ @ecramsfan8110 @messismofinito @warriors Nobody knows how the universe came to be. And aren’t you guys the ones that believe in miracles? Apparently Jesus clapped his hands and fed 10000 people. Irony is dead.@GnarlyNajee @jtfish22 @peppronip1ayboy @SWaisanen @warriors Then you're willfully ignorant, you don't give a fuxk about bettering our country. The Buffalo shooter was wearing body armor. Just like the shooter in Texas today, who was in a shootout with MULTIPLE cops when he got into the school and started killing kids. Your theory is bull.@espn @warriors Amen to that!@JohnEngelbert_ @warriors The mental illness is the gun fetish@warriors A reminder that Steve Kerry’s father was a victim of gun violence , so this is a very personal subject for him.

#GunControlNowLet’s go Golden state warriors! 
#Warriors #GSWvsMAVS #draymondgreen@Gindy @DarinCampbell20 @ShadrockQSC @JohnEngelbert_ @warriors Mexico —less school shootings, more massacres everywhere else.

Maybe the USA has a happiness problem. Misery factor getting pretty high@JayGotcha_11 @BthaTrader1 @seaside1776 @warriors Guns are not the problem. If you take away guns, people will just resort to another method.@warriors aren't you going to ask us where we are watching from?@zira_w @SP00KY_SQUIRREL @warriors Yes. If he had a knife, what would stop him from killing defenseless children?@warriors this is the realeast shit ive heard all year@tweeder530 @warriors You “no gun law” people said the same thing every time there is a gun violence.  Why don’t you try our way of “yes gun law” for a while to see if there is a decline (not elimination) of gun violence.  By the way, aren’t you guys pro life?? Life of 18 children and 1 adult today.@warriors Woke Steve Kerr is not gonna change anything.@IvabinSpended @blanco_ember @duttboireacts @warriors If Kabuki gives you comfort then that's good for you. But when it's done by people who will turn around the next day and do everything in their power to advocate for even MORE guns, then it is just empty posturing.@warriors I hope Coach Kerr does not consume alcohol because over 200 children are killed ever year in car accidents involving intoxicated drivers. I guess people who drink alcohol value a beverage over the lives of children by the logic so many here seem to embrace.@warriors See more passion about protect human life from basketball coach. Then from are own senators. That very sad@noneyabusines99 @slickwilly888 @Dave1253S @espn @warriors I don’t have to dig, I know exactly where my firearm and magazine is. But no one else could. Thats the part of this home safety I don’t understand from most gun owners. You have your gun right at your nightstand. That might be one of the first places robbers check for jewelry…@warriors Respect his passion regarding the tragedy but as I see it HR 8 would’ve done nothing to stop this individual from purchasing a gun the way he did. HR 8 establishes new laws for firearm transactions between two people. Has nothing to with store purchases. Simply uninformed.@warriors I shared this on my FB page. EVERYONE needs to make it known how FED UP we are, as Steve Kerr has done.@J_A_E_Chisum @JohnEngelbert_ @TheSquid99 @warriors That’s not a solution for him.  He cares more about his guns than the safety of other people.  Taking away guns and caring about others is an inconvenience for him and others of that mindset.@warriors @PluckDaGreat No gun control in a country with very high cases of mental health issues.@jcvelez9494 @victoriafhicks @seaside1776 @warriors Jerry, you have a very simple mind.

Who will hold the tyrants to account?@ThomDevine @warriors 19 people now.@WantGreatness @warriors We're the only country in the world with this issue. We have the most guns. Other countries have knives. When's the last time there was a mass stabbing in a school?@seaside1776 @warriors Boy, what an insight@warriors Plz run for office. We need people like you to make change@mwoodrowt @tweeder530 @warriors Look at Chicago strictest gun laws in the country and doesn’t stop the violence! New York also struck gun laws didn’t stop Buffalo@micnificent28 @warriors Automatic weapons have been nationally banned since the 1930’s. So that’s not accurate. “Combat grade”? What does that even mean? So you think guns are the root of the problem? Guns make people shoot people? You do realize that there are hundreds of millions of guns right?@espn @warriors It is always funny seeing people tell sports figures to stop talking about politics. So much of that being said here. Or willful misunderstanding the point the man was making.

Steve is a good man and I commend him for speaking his mind.@warriors Now do Chicago and China Steve@RayPaultre @BonelessPeanut @PardisonRodman @Dave1253S @espn @warriors Can’t get in.

No solution prevents all shootings.@MikeBraves2579 @BCrew211 @jonjonweb85 @DWSFungicide @espn @warriors Being afraid of not doing enough is a bushit, cowardly excuse to not do anything. As Kerr said we have a bill that's been on the floor for like 3 years@JohnEngelbert_ @TheSquid99 @warriors The rest of the world recognizes that mental health is important AND that easy access to guns = easy access to gun violence. You can (and should) address both.@warriors Laws do not work if people don't report so they can be enforced.@tweeder530 @warriors Actually, gun laws could stop it. Make handguns illegal, make semi-automatic rifles illegal...problem solved.@Nph144Patrick @erinmarie0922 @warriors There was 2 law enforcement officers that engaged him before he went into the school…he was wearing body armor and made it in anyway…🙄@daBookdragon @ShadrockQSC @JohnEngelbert_ @warriors Why don't they though?@SP00KY_SQUIRREL @warriors Why would anyone even think that guns lead to deaths? https://t.co/Du9EfNN3bY@Buscusriot @jcvelez9494 @seaside1776 @warriors Us isn’t even top for mass shootings per capita, and every country in the top 10 for mass shootings per capita is in Europe… “but @Buscusriot said there are fewer shootings”. Yeah that is correct, not on a per capita basis though.@tweeder530 @warriors Pretty sure if we require stricter background checks it would prevent some deaths in this country....it wouldn't even affect honest legal gun owners in a negative way....and im a gun owner myself@SWaisanen @the_dridge @warriors You are more likely to die from homicide if anyone in your home owns a gun as well. Do some research.@StephsMundo @warriors He played in San Antonio, was always a great guy@oatzee_ @SpillaneMj @WantGreatness @seaside1776 @warriors i agree@RandySav95 @bloodcicle @warriors It's quite timely. I was just watching the latest news report on TV. I was thinking people need more hope and faith in their lives.  Afterwards I jumped on Twitter and came to this thread. Not a coincidence !@NapoleonIV10 @rkevinm @espn @warriors Ah yes, tell the gun stores that they don’t know the guns they are selling.

Most of the people who commit crimes like this are killed in action or kill themselves when they are done. They don't give a shit about the jail time. This is the silliest fucking take I've ever heard. Please take time to think through thoughts.@MoneyKhash9 @warriors This is factual@PFrickleton @JohnEngelbert_ @airpreddy23 @warriors Yes they should.

No need to make mental health checks automatic, just make known mental health issues on record be part of the assessment process.@seaside1776 @warriors Ok but what about mitigation of these occurrences? Yes you can't stop it completely but making it harder for people to easily obtain weapons is a step in the right direction.@RockHawk @rkevinm @espn @warriors Still waiting for you to provide ONE example of a gun killing someone or something without human influence… your deflection only shows the lack of weight your position holds😘@burnabymartin @duttboireacts @warriors What problem would that solve?@warriors @coreybehnke Warriors have the biggest platform to get something done., if they are serious about it.

Guns are 100 percent the issue@warriors Where’s his mask@HockeyYogi @SWaisanen @steveowen91 @warriors Exactly. Not to mention why does this shit only happen in the US.

It’s scary not being able to walk to the grocery store.

Is it hard to understand?@meanlikepeachz @SWaisanen @warriors I'm so sorry. That sounds incredibly traumatic.@warriors Lets get it 🙏🙏🙏❤️❤️❤️❤️@warriors This man is a leader. He showcases qualities not a single politician in Washington possesses@warriors We need to stop cutting mental health funding and stop closing mental health facilities and stop cutting funds on out patient programs. Every mass shooting and killings are done by severely mentally ill people that’s facts!!@JohnEngelbert_ @warriors This is so tired… Only in the US. Every other place on the planet has mental health issues with SO MANY FEWER mass shootings; why is that? https://t.co/pTZkeI9vi5@tobbystweet @espn @warriors @NBA @POTUS How many people have been killed in Chicago this year by gun violence?  I don’t remember Coach Kerr being so upset about those people?@exact_of @DarinCampbell20 @BrainiacBball @ShadrockQSC @JohnEngelbert_ @warriors Google is free. Look at what countries have the most murders/homicides. You’ll find that the US isn’t even in the top 10.@warriors The fact is that Americans don’t care about dead elementary school children, or innocent people killed in Supermarkets, malls or churches.  They will make an argument that holding onto their guns is worth the lives of these children.  Deaf ears.@BrandonWWest @HockeyYogi @BrainiacBball @airpreddy23 @JohnEngelbert_ @warriors lol you say heinous criminals like theyre some kind of master mind the average criminal is no smarter than you or I the majority of people that want to commit crimes arent doing something crazy to get their guns they can literally go to their local store and just purchase one.@warriors Thank you, Steve!!

Additionally, those 50 senators who want to hold onto power despite what 90% of the American people want, they also represent only 44% of voters in the US. Clearly, their power has corrupted them to the point that our lives mean nothing to them.Steve Kerr, Head Coach of the Golden State Warriors irately demands change, and calls on senators to do the same. Wouldn’t take questions on the upcoming game. He put todays tragedy in Texas and those from a week ago in Buffalo and SoCal before anything.  https://t.co/zWEJUfgTTSNBA picks, best bets for Warriors-Mavericks Game 4: Why Dallas can avoid elimination against Golden State #CBSSpo... https://t.co/2ZCg2NynpW@SP00KY_SQUIRREL @warriors Yeah that definitely looks like someone that’s buying a gun on the black market.@warriors Steve Kerr is speaking for all decent Americans who want common sense gun control as this insanity of gun violence must stop.@warriors The Uyghurs would like a word.@warriors thank you, Steve Kerr@warriors Steve Kerr has courage and class. And he is right!!! We have to stop gun violence.@warriors Amen@SuperChronix @BlockChain187 @MountyNc @warriors because a UNIVERSAL gun registry is often a precursor to confiscation. Not to mention the cost of it. We tried that in Canada and it failed miserably.@warriors Love you coach 🤞
Continue speaking on behalf of your people@LarrySanchez79 @espn @warriors Idk about an all-out ban on guns. It may have good long term effects but how long is the actual question. I strongly agree with upping mental health evaluation tho. A lot of these shooters always have some sort of issue that makes them do these crimes.@warriors Let's do what Kerr says and when that fails to stop it then maybe we can address the mental health issues in this country@JohnEngelbert_ @warriors It’s a big problem (mental health issues in America) and it’s not easy. Simply passing more gun laws will not solve the violence issues in America.@warriors He is so fake. What is background checks going to do.@JohnEngelbert_ @warriors I bet there is a trail online of him looking at crazy content and talking to people that are also ill. I wish there was a red flag that can go out when people are engaging in content that only those who are suffering from mental illness would entertain.@warriors The coach didn’t say not once take your guns away!Damn it listen for once. He said 90% of the American people want better background checks. Thats it. Its political Because the republicans are the ones who wont vote on it Wait Mitch McConnell wouldn’t even bring it to the floor@tweeder530 @warriors Gun laws work all over the world.
They worked here also@warriors Steve, new York has the strictest gun laws in the nation including background checks.   The Buffalo shooter was mentally ill,  he had publicized his intentions.  His parents, the city..no one bothered to report that on this record and bought the gun.@warriors Coach Steve, man of impeccable honor.@Loud_Mouth_Soup @RearFactory @peppronip1ayboy @SWaisanen @warriors Nope would just be ready to put my life on the line to save others if it was needed. I’m sure you’d be fine wallowing in a corner watching kids and grandparents being killed@rkevinm @espn @warriors Every country in the world has mental health issues, this only happens here!!! But good try@UncvrngTheTruth @warriors BS.  The 18 year old broke multiple laws already in place today.  The bill he's screaming about wouldn't have stopped a thing today.  But that doesn't fit the narrative so avoid those facts right?? Make it political because that's easy@ChayceCreedy @camyyboy @JasonZellman @warriors Yes and the solution is to allow guns on school grounds to protect the kids and dissuade shooters. That’s the only solution that could have any sort of impact.@JohnEngelbert_ @warriors Do you really think other developed nations don’t have mental health issues. Give me a break with this ridiculously stupid argument that is thrown out every time. I’m fucking tired of it.@espn @warriors Steve Kerr is absolutely right!  Senators, do something now!@NapoleonIV10 @gnarlygale @eternallyboard @espn @warriors So you’re one of those people who, if they don’t like someone’s opinion, which just call them uninformed and lacking substance.

Ya, that tracks.@warriors Being a Warriors fan for so many years, it's the first time I saw coach Kerr so angry. Not about basketball. Not even about sports.@dave_klopp @espn @Patrickqueen_ @warriors There are many ways to purchase guns legally at gun shows.@espn @annajay___ @warriors Tragic 😥@espn @warriors What an amazing man.

Wtf are our intelligence agencies doing then?@noneyabusines99 @PardisonRodman @Dave1253S @espn @warriors I’ve heard diff reports. I’ve heard he took the guns from his grandma AND I’ve heard he bought the guns at a local store on his 18th birthday. I’ve heard more reports thag her purchased the guns. Are you 1000% sure he stole the guns? If not, you better verify that first@HockeyYogi @BrainiacBball @airpreddy23 @JohnEngelbert_ @warriors And besides how is a background check going to screen out 18 y/o white boys with no criminal history? 

Background checks are just going to discriminate against black and brown people as well as criminals.@NapoleonIV10 @rkevinm @espn @warriors Yes, because I have the power to pass an amendment. People like you are the ones stopping that.@ChrisCaine17 @WantGreatness @seaside1776 @warriors must be far easier with a gun because that’s what all the Americans are doing@unbiasedgswfan @espn @warriors It’s probably not practical given how many are already out there, we don’t want a society where only bad guys are armed either. 
If only there’s a magic button that takes all weapons away from the world.@espn @warriors God bless @SteveKerr for having the courage to speak up. The rest of us must do the same. @LeaderMcConnell@AliAdair22 @warriors I am that outraged!@BaloneySansWits @ThomDevine @warriors Nah.

Go back to your astroturfing farm.@warriors This guy must run for office! We need him! Our kids need him!@JohnEngelbert_ @warriors Tell that to the Mother in Texas who lost her child today. Every country has people with mental health problems. They don’t have the level of gun violence we do. This is clearly an American gun problem.@NapoleonIV10 @eternallyboard @espn @warriors Yes, a 250+ year paper that was written by white dudes that owned slaves and believed themselves to be superior to the natives. Keep living life according to the words of some dead racist.@SlickRick_83 @warriors But they are. Martin Bryant killed 35 people in Tasmania. We changed the gun laws. Zero mass shootings since. And trust me, we have our fair share of crazy evil people down here. They were all out protesting against covid health measures and vaccines.

Lololololololol@warriors He’s an amazing coach AND a great human being. He should run for office…@warriors Steve Kerr should run for president. And he fully understands this crisis. His father was gunned down in Lebanon.@NapoleonIV10 @eternallyboard @espn @warriors Time to repeal that garbage.@unbiasedgswfan @espn @warriors I would love that, but there are more guns than people in this country. I don’t see how it would be possible.

As far as keeping magazines separate from the firearm, what happens when someone breaks into your house with a loaded firearm and you are digging around for a magazine?@SWaisanen @steveowen91 @warriors We've made all kinds of weapons illegal or hard to obtain. Can't own an attack helicopter loaded with missiles. Why should automatic and semi-automatic guns be considered any different?

The shooter was 18. He wasn’t legally able to buy a handgun.@warriors Im sick of it too. “Thoughts and prayers” “moment of silence”… both rubbish sentiments. Totally dismissive to tragedies. Mealy mouthed senators who suck up to the NRA. He speaks for most of us. 👏🏼👏🏼@espn @warriors Here come the gun control folks... cause the bad guys always follow the rules. any word on securing the border? How about beefed up security measures at our schools? Maybe a little prayer for one another? Maybe a little more God in our society and alot less corruption?@espn @rhemrajani9 @warriors I respect the second amendment, but these things has got to stop.@bloodcicle @RandySav95 @warriors That's an awful thing to say to someone of faith. Just because you don't believe or have faith, doesn't make it cool to say something so ignorant. It doesn't advance a thing, except your ignorance.@moses_cobb @ThomDevine @warriors Such as?@NickWhitley_ @warriors So why not make meth, heroin, or cocaine legal when you can literally go out and get it anywhere right now?

He has been passionate about this issue for a very long time. And as mentioned by another, his personal story is incredible.@warriors Steve Kerr fucking rocks!@warriors I am with Steve Kerr 100% on this and as an Australian I cant understand how this can keep happening.

And nothing is more important than protecting innocents@ThomDevine @warriors Can we weigh in on Sandy Hook,or is it too early to comment on that????@warriors What does this have to do with basketball@warriors It is pathetic!

None of these armed guards were able to stop the shooter from killing.@giddieup20 @BrainiacBball @ShadrockQSC @JohnEngelbert_ @warriors We agree to disagree!@WantGreatness @shawnsal23 @CornellEJones @seaside1776 @warriors The fact that there’s no reason to not have strict gun laws is the problem.

Just reading the same old “guns don’t kill people, people kill people, mental health is the reason etc.  Background checks do not infringe on rights but could prevent “some” people who shouldn’t get their hands on guns.@WantGreatness @BthaTrader1 @seaside1776 @warriors you are missing the point entirely. every single action that can be taken, should be taken. even if it minimally lowers the number of senseless gun violence, it will save countless lives@JustinWeinstei9 @nFamousOneuhB @ThomDevine @warriors We make laws to try to prevent drug use even though it doesn't stop the use of illegal drugs but do absolutely nothing to try to prevent gun violence@NBA @warriors @memgrizz @chicagobulls @BrooklynNets @sixers The Embiid disrespect is real@WantGreatness @spikeatone @warriors Blocking you as you clearly swallowed every moron pill out there.@jose_briseno620 @espn @warriors No one is saying take guns away.

The gun laws in Australia stopped mass shootings.@TWDTV1 @NBA @warriors @memgrizz @chicagobulls @BrooklynNets @sixers They should just vote for the best players, we’re playing position less basketball@warriors Your tweet was quoted in an article by guyism https://t.co/XQHP0wKkIg@SWaisanen @steveowen91 @warriors that was written for muskets not machine guns... time to amend the Constitution@warriors Go Coach Kerr.

Tells you a lot@ReadingDiva3 @DpenaDaniel @BlockChain187 @MountyNc @warriors Is that so? How many guns used in mass murders are lawfully owned by the shooter?

(I'll give you a hint 2.5M)@Sultan10440883 @Dave1253S @espn @warriors Every single person I know has bought the majority of their guns via trade or private sale/gun show.

He has a cry in every other presser as part of his contract right?@LeanHamNeeson @Kestner01 @espn @warriors Imagine being a such a PoS you go to social media to tell some1 their beliefs thought morals are all made up and mock them like you know for a fact.

Odd that more extensive background checks is what you are commenting against.@warriors There’s a law that gives permission for anyone to hold a gun in Texas😡 let’s remove that law that and by removing that law I promise that at least we the people will have time to confront that crazy sup1d serial killer by hand and have the authorities use weapons if necessary.@warriors @DearMoon246 This man is a real leader@JohnEngelbert_ @warriors What if, and I'm just kinda spitballing here, what if the person behind the gun didn't have a gun?@JohnEngelbert_ @warriors You first@SWaisanen @warriors Or how about this.

Or should we simply just keep looking away &amp; pretend there isn’t an issue?@warriors Nobody listened to this I’m 100% convinced lol. He’s saying there needs to be mental health and background checks for EVERYBODY attempting to purchase a gun and he’s absolutely 100% correct.@NapoleonIV10 @rkevinm @espn @warriors The fact that we live in a country where laws that in no way could have predicted the future are governing and guide-lining our society.

Until we know more I guess we need more information on him@Chiefs534891322 @AWeberCivEng @spatty84 @warriors honestly,  bullets are expensive enough. trust me. yearly checks and universal bg checks are must imo. also should need super strict licenses to own shotguns or ARs or guns of that nature. same way suppressors are regulated. and heavy handed punishments for all crimes w/ guns@brianm1669 @BlockChain187 @tweeder530 @warriors But it might prevent another!!! Bat sh*t crazy logic, my god….@dawgs41feeney @dallasmavs @warriors @NBA Is that the right solution? don't play when things like this happened? you expect the shooters to be like "look they cancelled the game I'm gonna stop killing now". 🤦🤦@warriors Never got into basketball, but I am a fan of this guy for life.@warriors I don’t know this man but he gives me hope for your poor beleaguered country 💕😢@warriors Good for you!!!!@BetEasyWinners @the_dridge @warriors They don’t have a constitutional right to a firearm.

Librarians?

Like Trump’s idiotic statement about Pulse, that he wished some could have shot back, and had to be told firearms where alcohol is served isn’t done.@WantGreatness @warriors That’s BS. The gunman was wearing body armor and engaged authorities before he entered the school anyway. You can’t do that with a knife.  And your AR15 doesn’t have more rights than those kids that are no longer living.@espn @jaketapper @warriors Background checks already exist and the democrats run the country.@warriors How can u disagree with what he is saying. Change needs to be made. Politicians need to pull their heads out of the sand and make change.

Amirite?@warriors I have felt for a long time that Steve Kerr should be President. This only makes that feeling stronger.@seaside1776 @warriors Ah, fuck you're right why didn't I think of that! No law will stop murderers either right? Don't need that one. No law will stop someone from stealing right? Can throw that one out too. Since laws clearly don't ever stop people from doing things we can just get rid of them all!@Orphan_Gang @warriors @dallasmavs I care about likes zero.

But it will never show the mentality of someone.@BrainiacBball @airpreddy23 @JohnEngelbert_ @warriors No background checks are required in many states for guns sold “second-hand”. Which is why NRA-sponsored “gun shows” are where a lot of these guns used in shootings are purchased.@WantGreatness @DixonThompson2 @warriors And all of them are less efficient/more difficult than a gun.

We need your voice and we need it as loud as it can get.@NBA @warriors @memgrizz @chicagobulls @BrooklynNets @sixers funny how this team is better than the first one@JohnEngelbert_ @warriors It can be both.  It’s not one or the other.  The solution is multi faceted, and one of those components is gun control.@tweeder530 @warriors No…but gun laws can help hinder their ability to kill 18 children.@Its_Spectre_00 @SpotlessM @MountyNc @warriors I'm not denying that but proposing to increase the minimum wage or UBI is just ignorant. All that does is put us in this constant cycle of inflation which is how you end up with a $1,000,000 bank note like ZimbabweI didn’t know this about

#DubNation #StrengthInNumbers #GoldBlooded #WCFinals@warriors my new hero@warriors Wow!!! Good for him.. and omg some of the stupid replies!!!!@shawnsal23 @CornellEJones @seaside1776 @warriors Yes, but when you take away guns and they are forced to get creative, those bombs will become the new norm and easier to build. If you take away guns,
Evil will find another way.@WantGreatness @warriors A fucking knife won’t kill like a damn rifle, is that so hard to understand? Like have you seeing the video from Buffalo? IT TOOK 45 seconds to kill 10 people!!! 45 fucking seconds!!!@RayPaultre @BonelessPeanut @PardisonRodman @Dave1253S @espn @warriors No. But if you have a clean background, you should be able to purchase a firearm. That will never change my friend. As hard as you’ll try, the 2nd amendment will not be eradicated. You have to think of other ways-@warriors Thank you Steve!@warriors But yet they want to vote on abortion. Sickening.@espn @warriors 2/ But crying "Guns! It's Guns fault" when it fits your narrative and everyone can see through your lies&amp;agenda! Go help and do something for all the blk on blk Murder! Go get the homeless off the streets! But don't act like you want change until then@warriors There’s plenty of gun laws the problem is they’re not enforced@NBA @warriors @memgrizz @chicagobulls @BrooklynNets @sixers Notice how lebrons isn’t here@WantGreatness @seaside1776 @warriors Easy access to guns is one of the issues. That can be corrected. Will some still find a way...sure but a deterrent can def. Get one to change their corse of action...@WantGreatness @warriors Knives aren’t nearly as effective as guns are you 5@dillionharper1 @warriors Something is better than nothing@warriors It’s getting to the point where these senators have to be held up against a wall with their feet off the ground until they answer why they won’t move forward on this. Face to face and eye to eye with their constituents.@RepMTG The Head Coach of the Golden State Warriors has so much more common sense than you apparently! 

🤡 

https://t.co/vvfCcJNncrRT @espn: Warriors coach Steve Kerr spoke about the mass shooting at a school in Uvalde, Texas.

(via @warriors)
https://t.co/FrBGVFMkLW@noneyabusines99 @slickwilly888 @Dave1253S @espn @warriors Agreed that background checks don’t change many of these scenarios. But there needs to be serious penalties for the original gun owners in my opinion. As a firearm owner, I keep magazines seperate from the firearm itself. Thats just basic gun safety and I don’t have kids@Apiggy1990 @the_dridge @warriors Then why do all these mass shootings occur in gun-free zones? Obviously it won’t detest all mass shooters but a lot would second guess the location if they knew there was proper protection from security.@RandySav95 @warriors can you fire off 5 quick ways your imaginary god is going to help stop this happening again next week?@warriors Amazing words, coach!@SWaisanen @warriors Open carry would probably cause more problems tbh@Dz1005 @warriors Not with two dems who are bought by the same corporations as those of the right. Manchin and Sinema vote along donor lines, not party lines.Wake me up when it’s #NBAFinals 🏆 

@warriors vs @MiamiHEAT@Edo89448931 @GetAtMeMoore @warriors People are. School shootings are not a thing even in violent places in South America, and not for a lack of access to guns. Draconian gun control could make shootings more difficult, but a black market for arms would appear. Open carry would not be a magical solution either.@warriors I don't normally follow basketball, but I am now a fan of this team! This is a LEADER. I hope you all kick butt tonight!!@ThomDevine @warriors Yo what’s your address? Asking for a friend@MikeBraves2579 @jonjonweb85 @DWSFungicide @espn @warriors Ok bud. What changes would you like to see to try and curb these mass shootings? I’ll hang up and listen.Golden State Warriors are loaded, so really they (like the Boston Celtics) are a team that really shouldn’t make any trade. If GSW were to trade someone this ’22 offseason? It’d be James Wiseman or Jonathan Kuminga. Why Kuminga? Andrew Wiggins’ play in 2021-22 #NBA@Robreiner59 since we are twitter buddies. Thank you for all your movies … go watch @warriors Steve Kerr.. this how I feel@warriors Thank you for using your voice and your platform to add focus on this critical issue and call for action.@espn @AdamSchefter @warriors Have y’all not ever bought a fucking Gun? You have to have a background check to buy it. You fight guns with guns. We need protection. Protect kids like the president.@warriors Great step!! Sadly social media is still mainly populated w/ memes if high prices, 2A support and a stupid divorce case… 

Come on ‘Mericans!! Let’s be proud that our #1 cause of death for kids is firearms!!@warriors Steve Kerr, thank you 🙏🏻, please keep it up. You are my hero today.@RAJohnson09 @BCrew211 @SirRudolf714 @jonjonweb85 @DWSFungicide @espn @warriors But yet nobody here can say what laws you'd implement to change this. Just want to rant on twitter@TheNightIsDark7 @melucahoney @DavidMoss21 @ecramsfan8110 @messismofinito @warriors I honestly think insurance would make things worse. Most of these cowards end up killing themselves. This would only affect the people who follow the law and would just make the gov and others more money w/o solving any problemsTHIS. Watch this. Calling out cowards in Congress. The appropriate level of anger and disgust. TY Steve Kerr &amp; @warriors. We must vote out all who oppose backgd checks &amp; #CommonsenseGunLaws … every one of them: @GOP @Sen_JoeManchin @SenatorSinema 
#Enough https://t.co/MafE73HSh7@WantGreatness @seaside1776 @warriors You say taking guns away is like a wet bandaid but then how come japan doesn’t have mass shoutings like the USA does@WantGreatness @BthaTrader1 @seaside1776 @warriors y are we basically the only country with mass shootings@PardisonRodman @BonelessPeanut @slickwilly888 @Dave1253S @espn @warriors Yet more than often than not the good guy wins. Bad guys don’t give a shit about a background check btw.@JohnEngelbert_ @warriors Not every shooting is mental health…. Sometimes that seems to be the cop-out answer.
Yes, mental health is a crisis and totally under funded and that gets ignored too.@espn @warriors Remember when this piece of garbage positively compared China to the US?@GraellsiaMoon @peppronip1ayboy @SWaisanen @warriors I mean research it yourself@warriors True True the right in Washington is f..ing our country. Following an ex pres who couldn’t get 850 on his SAT’s. How dumb are we to keep these lunatics in power. We are a joke as a country. #50losers #50looses@JohnEngelbert_ @warriors Every other country has mental illness. We are the only ones with the level of gun violence we have today.@warriors Steve Kerr for President@espn @AdamSchefter @warriors Universal background check? You have a background check when you purchase a pistol already…also he was 18 so he couldn’t legally purchase a pistol. So I’m confused on this mindset@WantGreatness @warriors Idiotic lmao@espn @warriors Amen!@StephenCurry30 @warriors Hall Of Fame Human Being❤️@unbiasedgswfan @espn @warriors Bad people with guns are the problem. Not guns. And the mental health of the youth. Kids don’t fear consequences, and parents do a horrible job at raising kids. And when kids get emotional and bullied or mistreated, they lash out. Notice these school shooters aren’t 30+ year oldsThe Golden State Warriors are looking to sweep The Dallas Mavericks tonight at 9PM

Who do you think will win? https://t.co/scPTHiWfBC@ayobruhhhhhh @ocbeta @benjamintennar @warriors At least Australia doesn’t have more than one million dead and the other people caring more about their freedoms instead of that@warriors Kerr is 100%  correct…….DO SOMETHING!!!

Is it perfect? No.Does it weed out most of the wack jobs that can just walk into any store and buy a gun because they feel like it? 100%. Y'all need to do something@victoriafhicks @Buscusriot @seaside1776 @warriors There social media making sure they aren’t following the wrong trend or going a dark path. 3. I truly believe religion holds a society together and are more functional than atheists. Not saying that people have to be religious but even a family who have@TheSquid99 @warriors How about we fix the people and fix their issues? Just a thought.@CarlsenJersey @cheznico_ @ecramsfan8110 @messismofinito @warriors Oh for the love of humanity stuff it Hunter. I don’t need to fear god to know that shooting children and their teachers dead is reprehensible. We “deserve” it?! Kids deserved to get gunned down because people  “don’t fear god”? Terrifying logic. Terrifying.@NapoleonIV10 @Navglad @demonpebble @RealNBAExpert @espn @warriors That’s the kind of fucked thinking that allows this to occur.  Maybe we should update our rules every couple hundred rules.  Even the founders knew things would change.  That’s how we got amendments in the first place.@KevinG2k20 @nickbladen10 @MattSchlicher @unbiasedgswfan @espn @warriors Canadian here.. life is pretty good up here not sure what chaos you are talking about https://t.co/9n9aeLAGj6@seaside1776 @warriors I’ve lived in good neighbourhoods and bad neighbourhoods criminals don’t have gun licenses and neither do most people so nobody really as a gun besides people who are hunters cause it has to be kept in a safe or an approved area unloaded in your home I’ve never once feared@cutandswing @warriors So why doesn't this happen in Canada? Why don't people shoot each other over there? Maybe laws work, but I could be mistaken.@warriors Banned guns! https://t.co/PW2QI4PEgj@eric00224373 @Dave1253S @espn @warriors Commonwealth of Virginia does now require a state background check for a private transfer.

Nice.@Pats_Fan_603 @espn @warriors At this point, we need to up the mental health evaluation on background checks. All these shooters always have something wrong in the head that leads them to do these heinous crimes.@WantGreatness @seaside1776 @warriors Not true at all. Look at UK or Australia. Both experienced mass murders in 96 and actually heavily restricted guns. Do some research before just blindly commenting@warriors That was passionate. But he is wrong.@Kestner01 @LeanHamNeeson @espn @warriors Of all the other religions that have existed throughout history, Wlwhy is the judeo-christian idea of god the correct one? Why is the greco-roman or norse pantheon considered mythology. All religion is created by man in an effort to explain the world around us.@espn @RethinkIntel @warriors Thank you Coach Kerr. We need more like you to stand up and speak out.@WantGreatness @seaside1776 @warriors I'd rather run from a fire or fight off a knife than to try to dodge AK bullets.@warriors @MeidasTouch I have new mad respect for Steve Kerr.@brokeycs @BlockChain187 @MountyNc @warriors Dude I am Venezuelan, I lived there for 28 years.

Can’t make this stuff up.@jeffries_edgar @bradybuzz @warriors @DubsCommunity Mentally ill people in other countries are not able to inflict this much damage. You're wrong.@warriors Thank you for taking a stand and calling out the pathetic senators in this country@warriors Please Steve....get a grip. The very city and state you live in is falling apart with crime and murder with some of the strictest gun laws and you don't say a thing about the genocide and slave labor happening to the Uyghurs in China which your team and league profit from greatly@espn @rhemrajani9 @warriors Go @SteveKerr. And shame on every senator that stands in the way of common sense gun law reform!!@SWaisanen @GraellsiaMoon @SportFan07740 @warriors shifting goalposts.@warriors Coach Kerr said it all.

The list of mass shootings is too long for a tweet; 1,000s murdered.

Moment of silence.
Thoughts &amp; prayers.
Rinse.
Repeat.
Nothing changes.

We're not safe at school, work, houses of worship, malls, grocery stores &amp; movie theaters.

Is this freedom?@SWaisanen @warriors lay off the crack pipe@SWaisanen @JasonZellman @warriors Anytime a gun goes off at a school I’ll count as a school shooting@warriors All the people who support guns are accountable for this tragedy.@warriors Good for you!! 👏👏👏@tFrankMurphy @SWaisanen @warriors And to your point, at the Buffalo shooting we had an armed security guard who fired at the shooter. He had protective armor. Guns arent the solution.@dhlawrencexvii @ThomDevine @warriors This guy is a teacher?@ayobruhhhhhh @Edo89448931 @GetAtMeMoore @warriors Right? So those who don’t want to go are forced by the government of Australia. Or did I miss something? And those look like camps too me.@SWaisanen @WeirdScienceDC @warriors You know the real,point but it’s cool bro.  Pretend you are right when you see 288 and the next number is 8.

We’re the ONLY COUNTRY IN THE WORLD WITH THIS PROBLEM. ITS PRETTY SIMPLE@warriors @SteveKerr respect!@warriors @MeidasTouch I feel the same way coach@schmekelt @warriors I want the government to do something as much as all of you but do you realize they are all bad people??

@SenatorDurbin @SenDuckworth you’re my senators. Make it happen! I’m holding you responsible@DiaboloSkins @tweeder530 @warriors I am for common sense gun laws. But his statement was that gun laws don’t fix broken people. Hard to argue with that statement.

We do have a mental health crisis in this country. But the right is using that issue as a smokescreen every time kids get massacred these days@WantGreatness @RotoRiley @CornellEJones @seaside1776 @warriors Exactly! It should be more challenging for these people to commit such heinous crimes not easier! What are you even saying right now?@albarezd @AlBundy5000 @BIGTOMSWORLD @espn @warriors Thirdly; I don’t think anyone like you can even provide input on gun laws and opinions when you can’t even do a simple Google search that takes 3 seconds to know what laws already exist.@WantGreatness @seaside1776 @warriors Ask yourself, why isn’t there more mass school knifings?  Because guns are more effective at killing people.  You can’t run from a bullet, you can run from a person with a knife or sword.  A locked school door is not bulletproof, but it is fucking knife proof.@GnarlyNajee @peppronip1ayboy @SWaisanen @warriors Oh if Gnarly Najee says so@warriors Commenting from Canada: Warriors, you have a coach to be SO proud of@barebearbaire @benjamintennar @ThomDevine @warriors Anyone but blaming an inanimate object is about as dumb as it gets@GetAtMeMoore @warriors But don't like 5O% of illegal guns originate from legal purchases? Making guns more difficult to obtain legally will consequently affect the flow of illegal firearms. Do you disagree?@RandySav95 @warriors Spare me this f’ing garbage! People who bury their heads in the sand by thinking some white bearded old man and his son who live in the sky are going to save us. Absolute nonsense!This is leadership.

It’s absolute common sense.@albarezd @AlBundy5000 @BIGTOMSWORLD @espn @warriors On top of that they need to raise the age which you can buy a gun, perform those mental health checks bi-annually, register guns etc. having just one of these isn’t gonna stop it.

We need to start somewhere, and we needed to start it decades ago. Thanks for your reply@espn @warriors Thank God somebody famous with the forum to speak out about it finally did. My  deepest respect goes to coach Kerr for what he did. Who cares what party you belong to. People are getting massacred almost every day anymore.

You can’t convince me he wouldn’t have been.@johhnnpp @Buscusriot @seaside1776 @warriors Except that’s untrue. School shootings, public mass shootings, and race violence is the highest in the United States, and by a huge margin as well.@warriors Sorry to said this to you Mr Steven Kerr. @LeaderMcConnell already acknowledged in an interview in Vox that party and power are above country #GunControlNow #GunControl@unbiasedgswfan @espn @warriors Because if anything repeats itself, it’s history.

At a press event instead of talking/ caring about bball, he gave an impassioned speech compelling US senators to action after the school shooting in Texas.

Would love to see the mavericks beat you, but even if they don't,  you choke in the final.  Bye Felicia.@Kestner01 @espn @warriors God is an entity understood on a very personal level. You may need god. But not everyone needs god, because the concept of god is so very different. What we need is for people to be better humans and to respect life. It seems, We as people have no value of life anymore.@warriors This is great and all. We’re fed up with it. Yet do we really think laws and background checks are going to stop someone that’s wanting to do harm to others. They will find a way. People break laws everyday even with them in place. It’s a nice thought.😤 Andrew Wiggins was in the zone last time out!

I understand your statement but it’s not happening here!@espn @warriors Will the RACIST organization @espn allow their employees to tweet about this TRAGEDY..Because the RACIST organization @espn wouldn’t let it’s employees mention the RACIALLY TARGETED MASSACRE that happened in BUFFALO!!!@Benjamin42779 @warriors You know the players could do way more than the coaches. They could  have all out of games.@DWhippo @warriors For gun control to pass you will need 60 votes in the senate or else it will fall to the filibuster. There are 48 Democrats, 2 Independents, and 50 Republicans. 

2 Independents usually vote with Dems, so they need 10 Republicans to come along. Won't ever happen@JGalica1 @espn @warriors The quickest way right now is to get the Dems 52 senators. Then Manchin and Sinema become irrelevant and we abolish the filibuster and pass all the shit we possibly can in the next two years.@ArmbrusterTim @DoremusJ @benjamintennar @ThomDevine @warriors Well if something comes out then I definitely will apologize but any 18 year old I knew didn’t have a criminal background at 18 years old@WantGreatness @seaside1776 @warriors Nothings going to 100% rid us of these shootings. But small changes will help here and there. If doing one thing can save even just on life why not do it?@WantGreatness @CornellEJones @seaside1776 @warriors And building together a bomb is a lot harder than picking up a gun, killing people with a knife is way more difficult than pulling a trigger, hell buying shit to make a bomb is harder, why would you wanna make things easier for these psychos in the first place?@MazCali @warriors Or officers to always be on the premises. Or anyone properly trained to volunteer to protect. The choice is yours. But by promoting the areas as fun-free leads shooters to feel safer and like they can cause more destruction.Well said by @warriors coach Steve Kerr https://t.co/UraWLlM45v@Tzacher2001 @benjamintennar @ThomDevine @warriors I’m not sure if background checks ignore juvenile criminal records but if so we need to fix that pronto@warriors Thank you!!

read up! sounds like you got some learnin to do@tweeder530 @warriors But gun laws will stop “broken” people obtaining guns.@WantGreatness @RealJuanColon @seaside1776 @warriors All more difficult than just simply shooting a gun and killing 10+ people in a couple of minutes. Think. If you truly want to be great like your handle “Want Greatness”.@Dawglf1 @dukeskygaen @GladGlizzy @RealNBAExpert @espn @warriors The fact that you even have to ask that is alarming. 18 kids died, and that doesn’t seem to faze you. And he’s not referring to you specifically, he’s talking about the general population of gun owners. It’s actually concerning that someone you’re this stubborn about it."They want to hold on to their own power. It's pathetic!"

Golden State Warriors Coach Steve Kerr lashing out at U.S. Senators who refuse to take any action on gun control after yet another mass shooting at a school.

Just not worth the time.@9810Petor @sirafsirafsiraf @espn @warriors Democrats city…?@RandySav95 @warriors Lmao god wont do shit. God doesnt fucking exist. Its someone who was on a mushroom trip that invented this higher being. Give me a break. Only people who can save us are: THE PEOPLE@micnificent28 @warriors So you think they should take peoples weapons? How will you know whose to take?@warriors GOAT!@warriors Fuck the gun nuts@SWaisanen @warriors What are you smoking? The "good guys with guns" were already there and already engaging the shooter before he even entered the school, and he still managed to murder all those kids. Your idea is stupid@SWaisanen @warriors We have open carry in Texas didn’t help@MikeBraves2579 @BCrew211 @jonjonweb85 @DWSFungicide @espn @warriors Do you really think if laws weren't in place that the amount of people DUI or using drugs would remain the same. Obviously you can't stop everyone but why would you not try to limit the opportunity for shit like these? Why are you in favor of mass shootings?@choc0ne0one @SWaisanen @warriors Like fighting fire with fire.@StephenCurry30 @warriors Awesome! No other way to describe this. Thank you, Coach Kerr, for saying what has needed to be said for forever!@enjoyGLOBE @dallasmavs @warriors Worst Telecom company! Trash internet!@warriors i think its best to cancel this game and re schedule it.@GraellsiaMoon @brandondaly2018 @warriors So explain how any “solution” would have prevented this?This country is so messed up, and  the fact the nba is playing games and other sports are playing games today. The NBA playoff game which is like 4hours away from shooting is being played shows no empathy and is disgusting .  @dallasmavs @warriors @NBA disappointing@warriors Spot on@ThomDevine @warriors YOU. PLEASE. STOP.
IT'S IMMORAL.
SHOCKING.
DISGRACEFUL!
And NOT inevitable!@maxgreemeer @espn @warriors No buy laws won’t change anything ….do people still drugs because they are illegal?@GetAtMeMoore @warriors Defending the guns...try again@Kestner01 @espn @warriors Based on real life and science. Real things. Not a book written by humans hundreds to thousands of years ago. You want to live in a story book world, go to Harry Potter World in Orlando@warriors Until the USA gets rid of its guns you re ALL colluding in gun violence &amp; each &amp; every gun death.  Think about it!@tweeder530 @warriors We don't have more mental illness than anywhere else in the world; we DO have more access to military hardware than anywhere else in the world. This is an asinine argument just so you can keep your sports gear. Dead. Fucking. Kids. Every year. Every month. Enough is Enough.@ThomDevine @warriors Oh come on. It IS a political issue. Our government officials are owned by gun lobbies. What facts are missing?@espn @warriors LOVE YOU DUDE..
I REALLY DO... YOU ARE A CLASS HUMAN BEING 
STEVE KERR... https://t.co/sDqIIBo3rm@NBA the game should be canceled tonight. How you play a game miles away from tragedy like this??? @dallasmavs @warriors https://t.co/918yjNBddc@TSN_Sports @warriors This makes me believe there are still good, sane people in the world. Thanks Steve Kerr…@warriors bout to close this thing out tonight@warriors @SethAbramson Don’t play. Walk off. Everyone, everywhere. Just stop. Walk out. Grind it all to a halt until those fuckers vote to end this madness.@GnarlyNajee @jtfish22 @peppronip1ayboy @SWaisanen @warriors It had an armed security guard who was a recently retired police officer. One of the 1st shot.@AliAdair22 @warriors Not everyone has a father who died as a result of gun violence. His outrage is deeply rooted and his experience can only be imagined by most.@warriors "We don't need laws to keep pedos away from children, that will only stop the law abiding ones."

 How ignorant does this sound?@warriors @PMTsportsbiz Political acting by a man who still wears a mask after vaccinated with double boost@_LordJoseph @benjamintennar @ThomDevine @warriors And murdered elementary kids, church goers, and grocery shoppers is just a consequence of our unparalleled protection and safety? Listen to yourself. You guys act like this is just something we have to accept, as if it's normal for everyone else in the world. It's not.@warriors Well stated! I’m proud that Coach Kerr has the integrity to speak out@warriors @FaZeBlaze perfectly said.@warriors Thank you 🙏 🙏🙏🙏
We need more courageous people like you.@SWaisanen @EdgarBased @warriors Two of the last 3 shootings had shooters who were confronted by armed security and police and still killed so many people. It’s a stupid fucking idea.@fezlab @unbiasedgswfan @espn @warriors The other caveat is that when the government controls the media they control the masses.  That has been steadily occurring for some time@airpreddy23 @JohnEngelbert_ @warriors Wtf.  I’ve had a background check for every single one of my guns. Who is legally getting a gun without a background check?  To say we need background checks is funny IMO.

I’ll admit I don’t know yet how this kid got his weapon.@SuperChronix @BlockChain187 @MountyNc @warriors It's better than nothing. People also thought the mighty british army would destroy some crop farmers with guns.@warriors Many ppl will argue that this isn’t the time or the platform for gun control policy. Those arguments are bullsh*t. Kerr is an American citizen, in a country where thousands die annually from gun violence. He has the right to speak on it, and now is the right time. Period.@warriors Steve Kerr sounding very much like his mentor. Well said and another example why his players love him. I'm sure Pop is proud of you Steve.@TWrBro0ski @JohnEngelbert_ @warriors There are pay what you can options all across the country (I’m currently paying 50 per session).  If you can’t afford therapy then you shouldn’t be buying guns.@ThomDevine @warriors What facts do u need?@RandySav95 @warriors Ya or we could take concrete action to try to stop preventable tragedies from happening ourselves instead of burying our heads in the sand and crying because life can be hard. Absolutely pathetic, you should be ashamed. Don’t trust the government, trust the magic man in the sky😂@JohnEngelbert_ @warriors If the mentally ill couldn’t access weapons, these things wouldn’t happen.@BasedElon777 @nickbladen10 @MattSchlicher @unbiasedgswfan @espn @warriors I also had sex with a gun today@ThomDevine @warriors You deserve your ratioing@TheEvanMcDowell @DavidMoss21 @ecramsfan8110 @messismofinito @warriors Trust me Twitter friend. This is a unspeakable tragedy but we’re so far into guns as a country there is almost no turning back now unless we want a civil war or some sort of Marshall law. I don’t know if there are any right answers to this unfortunately@rkevinm @espn @warriors Our country isn’t an outlier on mental health. But you knew that because you researched I’m sure.@warriors GENIUS!!! thanks@GetAtMeMoore @warriors Statistically there is little support that  mental health is involved in nearly all mass shootings. It’s an easy scapegoat to posture and deflect but not accurate.@warriors I have enormous respect for you… thank you.@warriors How you gonna stop people from getting guns illegally tho? Shit ain’t gonna change anything, THATS why they aren’t going to pass that law@Buscusriot @BillB90 @seaside1776 @warriors I did.  Gangs, drugs, and nut-bag teenagers that are screwed up in the head.@JohnEngelbert_ @warriors Your not going to solve anything@richy0731 @Dave1253S @espn @warriors You can buy new guns or old guns in Texas, no license, no background check, no permit
You can buys guns at gun shows no background check
You can buys guns on the internet no background check@warriors Don't care about his thoughts on the tragedy but I hope he is concentrating on a sweep.@warriors @MA_PerreaultTVA @SteveKerr for president 🙏@warriors He's right!!
#EnoughIsEnough@SWaisanen @warriors Fucking L@dave_klopp @espn @Patrickqueen_ @warriors Your confidence is misplaced. Texas has no requirement for background checks unless they're buying from special gun dealers. 57% of legal gun purchases in Texas did not involve a background check. https://t.co/fAmk4hXb2A
https://t.co/UtqGU8MV8M@RandySav95 @warriors What kind of a God allows for this type of behavior? Stop hoping someone else or something else will take responsibility for the crazy crap Americans perpetrate on one another@StephenCurry30 @warriors Sorry for all the slander Steph, this is the most clutch thing you could do brutha. Putting things in perspective, some things are bigger than basketball. 💯🫶🏼@Navglad @demonpebble @RealNBAExpert @espn @warriors A state that has a waiting period vs a state that doesnt has the exact same background check. The entire purpose of the waiting period is in hopes that someone who is going to do something stupid has time to cool off or rethink. Once again it seems like you are very uninformed.@nxtflch @warriors The problem is mental health, the lack of faith in God. The lack of love towards each other. The lack of care. It’s a sad world…I think @warriors are gonna let the mavericks win game 4 so that they can win the series on thea home court #GSWvsMAVS@MountyNc @warriors well doing nothing sure doesnt seem to fucking fix anything@SWaisanen @the_dridge @warriors Why don't the other 90%+ SAFER other countries think of that@warriors POWERFUL!!

Thank you.@ThomDevine @warriors It’s a fucking school shooting, it’s inherently political, the facts are that children are dead.@warriors Thank you Steve.@tweeder530 @warriors Background checks are literally the minimum we should do but we wanna hand em out like candy.@warriors Thanks kerr@espn @warriors No Steve, they won’t put childrens lives before their own power. It’s shocking, but they won’t. That’s your answer.This! This is what compassion, common sense, concern LOOKS and SOUNDS like. Thank you @warriors for hiring a man who is this clear-voiced, level-headed, rational. #SensibleGunControlNOW https://t.co/hXCTZ7NyZA@JohnEngelbert_ @warriors why not also stop giving crazy people guns?@warriors Well said, I hope someone listens. It's disgusting that this is still happening!@ThomDevine @warriors I hate to be the one to tell you but it IS a political issue.@WantGreatness @shawnsal23 @CornellEJones @seaside1776 @warriors That's speculation, and requires a whole lot more effort than grabbing a gun and pulling the trigger.@warriors Thank you for posting this.  Coach Kerr speaks for me and millions of the rest of us.@capybaric @McLean_Deluxe @donato501 @unbiasedgswfan @espn @warriors And there are still Commie Leftists in our military also. The people are allowed to protect themselves from those people.@espn @AdamSchefter @warriors Thanks for this@KrispyxNugget @WantGreatness @seaside1776 @warriors For one person, maybe two... they're not getting 15 people.@DiaboloSkins @mwoodrowt @tweeder530 @warriors I'd wager Marty understands this perfectly well.

His killing them with kindness approach is intended to make the person ask tough questions and think about their position from a different perspective.

Can you see how you saying "NO, YOU ARE JUST WRONG" is less than helpful?@espn @warriors We fucking need you on the floor of the Senate Coach Kerr and off the hardwood‼️@warriors Wish we had real world leaders, coach Kerr would be a great leader@KozyTweets @SWaisanen @the_dridge @warriors Sam is under educated , you can’t blame him. The system failed him too@warriors America for you 😂@Chiefs534891322 @warriors Its Called NICS National Instant Criminal Background Check and its been around since 1993.@warriors It’s not the fucking mental health. We need stricter gun laws and high power rifles should be fucking banned.@espn @warriors Why is no one talking about mental health and how to deal with these people that are killing all of these poor innocent victims. You can put all of the laws you want in obtaining a gun, they will still get them. Mental illness and dealing with it is the issue!@espn @warriors Thank you for using your microphone to send a message that sadly those 50 Senators are laughing at while we cry with victim after victim.  It’s a disgrace, and with today’s news more Americans decided to buy a gun and complain about the inflation in the price of their bullets.@warriors Thank you Steve@Edo89448931 @GetAtMeMoore @warriors Same here in Canada. A lot less guns and no mass shootings. Coincidence?Steve Kerr,  Head Coach of the Golden State Warriors https://t.co/YQ0MsFEL8i via @YouTube@warriors Thank you, coach 💔💔💔 #EnoughIsEnough @SenateGOP@warriors Did you ever watch Amazing Grace and Chuck? You athletes have the power!!! Don’t finish the playoffs. Stop the games.  Rise up!!@xandolt @SportFan07740 @warriors Wow great argument for combating this issue. Attack everyone who doesn’t support mass gun regulations that wouldn’t have prevented this anyway.@maliprincess @BCrew211 @jonjonweb85 @DWSFungicide @espn @warriors Yeah tweeting about it really makes you part of the solution.@warriors Are we close to the edge of the Abyss? Close to the edge of desperation? 
#GOP knows, "we gonna lose power if we want to save the kids".
Think about that for a second. 
Power is everything for them, nothing else matters. Disgusting@WantGreatness @BthaTrader1 @seaside1776 @warriors So why do these mass murderers use guns instead of knives? 

Hint: One can kill dozens of people in seconds, the other one can't.@micnificent28 @warriors The KGB, Navy Seals nor any other military unit carry AR’s. So you’re saying AR’s aren’t often used in crimes? I’ll ask again, should a homeowner not be equally or BETTER armed than that if someone breaking into their home?@tweeder530 @warriors Facile talking point for the gun lobby. Other countries have citizens with mental health problems but don’t have weekly mass shootings. Guns are the problem.@warriors have the best coach in the NBA in Steve Kerr. Him and Popovich represent the best. I love Kerr for this. https://t.co/PVn9ATVCcJ@Rob_Roth @Firesto93188622 @unbiasedgswfan @espn @warriors I mean I think they take away guns from bad people…. Believe you cannot be a felon and legally acquire a fire arm. What’s well regulated?  Just less guns?@ChrisRice0984 @espn @AdamSchefter @warriors Chris: your response is so inhuman.@ThomDevine @warriors Dude pull your head out of your ass!!! This is as political as it gets. Well said Steve Kerr!!@warriors Posting about guns does not make change...and there is a pattern.  The only way this changes is we put MONEY behind it and "Make" the politicians see the light.

Only people do🧹🧹 @warriors make it happen@espn @warriors This man is a gem.@ThomDevine @warriors 14 kids were killed because a 18 year old had access to a gun, thats all the facts u need@warriors let get this 4-0 tonight 🔥💪🏾👏🏾 #DubNation #GoldBlooded@JohnEngelbert_ @warriors npc alert 🚨 ignore 🚨@SWaisanen @GraellsiaMoon @SportFan07740 @warriors it’s amazing that they never said mass shootings and just said shootings@warriors Amen@cheznico_ @ecramsfan8110 @messismofinito @warriors Man just started projecting everything he could just because dude said he owned a gun, and then said ‘conversation over’ like it was some mic drop exclamation point. Get over yourself smh 😂🤦🏽‍♂️@JohnEngelbert_ @warriors Agree, but how about we fix the fatherless homes. Look at the percentage of people that do this type of sick act. No father at home. We’ve normalized broken homes and in fact reward it with how strong a person is, so brave, etc.@espn @warriors Why do the sheep keep returning the same people to office and then expect true change@danamcbride222 @Gdavila17Gloria @dave_klopp @espn @Patrickqueen_ @warriors His dad was assassinated.@RandySav95 @warriors God’s a figment of your imagination@dave_klopp @MarkMetzger7 @espn @Patrickqueen_ @warriors One party is holding up legislation.

#EnoughIsEnough@warriors Thank you!@mokeysnacks @Warty_Bliggens @Bacccup1 @ecramsfan8110 @warriors How is not having a gun a punishment? You only have a gun to defend yourself with others from guns, and your right to gun ownership is actually costing the lives of dozens of elementary school kids every day@ezmoney247365 @GoldenBoys027 @warriors I’m in the UK. No armed guards at schools here.@warriors Thank you sir! ENOUGH!@warriors STEVE KERR FOR PRESIDENT.@warriors aren’t good at close out games this post season so I’m giving this one to the @dallasmavs@SamforOhio @ChrisMurphyCT If you haven't seen the video of the Golden State Warrior's coach tonight, check it out.@steveowen91 @warriors Uh you cannot make it too hard to get a gun due to it being a constitutional right. If you’re able-abiding citizen the government has no right to be selective with who can and cannot protect themselves.@thisaintnoel @warriors FOR THIS ONLY!@GetAtMeMoore @warriors Health care@warriors Thank you, Coach!@warriors I like da warriors now https://t.co/Zq4MLFquaw@seaside1776 @warriors Yet no other country has our problems? What’s the difference@SWaisanen @warriors Only 1st world country with the gun crime of a 3rd world nation.

If you take guns away the only people left with guns are people who got them illegally…@warriors You know we are fking up when a coach goes on tv and talks about politics and common sense laws that should have been in place April 20, 1999@Kestner01 @espn @warriors Really? If that’s the best you got we are in trouble.@jcvelez9494 @Buscusriot @seaside1776 @warriors Do you realize that our government has incentivized single-parent households? That regulating internet access goes against our constitutional rights? That the US has no official religion (despite Eisenhower’s best efforts)?

Keep on these politicians.@GetAtMeMoore @warriors Pacified for the convenience of the staff rather than the benefit of the patient m. And that’s if you can get a bed. Anyone who wants to have the conversation about how mental health, not guns m, is the real issue can come talk to me when anyone actually cares about mental@_TheBoy_25 @McMenamin @espn @warriors Jimmy G’s not worth it either tbh. I hope Hurts can still have time to prove himself this season. As for Reagor, running an offense with an extra lineman instead of having him for receiver would be more beneficial for our team.@warriors @JohnWaltonPxP Such an ahole, sentiments are right but he is totally wrong on this issue@warriors When he retires from coaching, I know where we need him.@warriors Excellent leadership from Steve Kerr.  Thank you. 

This must be our message!@RandySav95 @warriors OH SHUT UP W/YOUR GOD!Steve Kerr is right. #Senate should be ashamed for their inaction. @dallasmavs @warriors @NBA should boycott games until there is meaningful gun reform https://t.co/YzVQler6VR@Gayle7106 @espn @AdamSchefter @warriors To hell with what you think is wrong.

NPCville 101@warriors Thank you from Europe.@jose_briseno620 @espn @warriors Why don’t other countries have this problem? They put laws on guns and we’re not hearing about mass shootings couple times a week. People getting them illegally are not going to schools, public places or churches and killing randomly. They are going for specific individuals#RT @espn: Warriors coach Steve Kerr spoke about the mass shooting at a school in Uvalde, Texas.

The traditional giving of opinions by sports heads who have a ton to say about guns, but stayed quiet while the country was up in flames for months during 2020@dave_klopp @espn @Patrickqueen_ @warriors Perhaps because prayers are utterly useless and are only offered in these situations by certain people because they have no interest in ever doing anything to stop it happening again.@ThomDevine @warriors Shut up@AussieGeckotv @nxtflch @GetAtMeMoore @warriors They have background checks.... ffs@RickyMaster808 @warriors “Free speech!

I’m sure everyone with mealth health issues have that type of money@warriors Thank you, Coach. That's leadership. republicans don't care if your child, mother, father, sister or brother is murdered as long as there's a buck to be made. all have A+ NRA ratings. Vote them out!@Buscusriot @kameron_patton @seaside1776 @Rene_Rugeles @johhnnpp @warriors There are hundreds of gun laws. Not everyone can purchase a gun. You clearly have never purchased a fire arm. You are literally required to submit to a fbi background check. Criminals will get guns regardless of the law anyway. That is fact.@SWaisanen @the_dridge @warriors Says the dude that doesn't even know Texas has open carry. Shame those grade schoolers forgot their deterrents@duttboireacts @warriors On the opening tip off, both teams players sit down on the court and refuse to play. Let the game end in a 0-0 score or be rescheduled

Because nobody except the NRA, gun manufacturers and certain US politicians are winning when it comes to gun violence.@dave_klopp @espn @Patrickqueen_ @warriors This is you. https://t.co/KNeQ1nnrSf@Rumrunner11 @McLean_Deluxe @donato501 @unbiasedgswfan @espn @warriors Did the U.S. attempt to do what Australia did?"Thoughts and prayers" just aren't enough.

We are the only civilized country with mass shootings ESPECIALLY at the rate we do. It’s the guns@warriors All the mass shooters are male.  We have lots of lonely, isolated, and angry young men in this country.  If the population was 100% female and we had the same amount of guns, we'd have no mass shootings.  All Steve Kerr cares about is politics and his bullshit narrative.@ThomDevine @warriors Here are your facts bud https://t.co/OCXG2e5PyV@warriors Thank you mr Kerr ,  I’ve had more than a damn enough,  Butthe republicans will continue to sit on their arse andDO ABSOLUTELY POSITIVELY NOTHING!!!

If someone is mentally unstable enough to do something like this we should be questioning more why he is still roaming in  the general population vs being locked away@4PF_Max @MountyNc @warriors And who’s fault is that? You don’t think he could’ve just waited until he actually killed everyone to release the manifesto?? Psychopaths can fake being normal, I doubt it’s that difficult (not an expert, just saying)@RomeroNavy78 @warriors 90% of the voting population being held hostage by 50 senators@warriors Thank you for using your voice! This needs to end!@ecramsfan8110 @messismofinito @warriors Congratulations. What are you doing to reshape gun culture? Are you condemning those who perpetrate gun violence? Do you even CARE about these issues? Why is it that when mass shootings happen those who own guns choose to fnd excuses to justify owning one (or several)?@JohnEngelbert_ @warriors Yeah well they get guns because they’re mentally instituted that’s why we need background checks dip shit come on brother this let’s get this party blindness out of our way@NapoleonIV10 @eternallyboard @espn @warriors WELL-REGULATED“What I love about this time of year is the weather’s getting good and the stakes are getting high” @KlayThompson #NBAPlayoffs #GoldenStateWarriors@GGMM_2020 @RIMonTheRim1 @DavidMoss21 @messismofinito @warriors Have you read the comments?

 Make the background checks wayyy more extensive...it takes 5- 25 minutes for a gun background check to come back...should take wayyy longer than that.@JayOkay9 @Bacccup1 @ecramsfan8110 @messismofinito @warriors ok here is me letting you know it is harder to own a gun legally than to own a gun legally. glad to help!

i am sure you are more mad at me than the kid that did this and that is wild to me@SWaisanen @the_dridge @warriors Yes let us have crossfire shootouts in schools, supermarkets and churches.

At least know the facts.@steveowen91 @SWaisanen @tFrankMurphy @warriors He's not using logic . he's using some association  he created  from some source that suggested that open carry is a solution, with no further  research. He is America@warriors Steve Kerr for whatever office he wants@warriors Thank you!!@shawnsal23 @CornellEJones @seaside1776 @warriors Because once the psychopath is denied a gun, he’s going to go home and build a bomb to do 10x the damage.@TheCount721 @rkevinm @espn @warriors Just a reminder that there is a mental health crisis in the UK as well... so I wonder what would make this so different...

We need more of this@GetAtMeMoore @warriors When will American stop with this guns don’t kill people people kill people crap?  It’s simply semantics. People kill people with guns no guns means a lower ability for people to kill people. And enough with this illegal gun crap too.

What is this gun for?  Don't be silly. Then make all drugs legal too. Or make all dangerous things legal. There will be people who have this things in their home but will not use it. Don't punish them either.@MountyNc @warriors Awful background checks! Pass the law and then you can say I told you so if these incidents continue. Why are cowards like you so afraid to enact something? Anything is better than the situation we find our country in@SWaisanen @tFrankMurphy @warriors Brain dead excuse.

There is not a single military in the world that could possibly invade a country with 100 million gun owners. Including the United States military because our soldiers wouldn’t go to war with their own families and friends.@warriors Is he talking about the same senators who are sending billions worth of weapons to another country?@espn @AdamSchefter @warriors Love Coach Kerr. A great man who gets it. Thank You Coach. That is what integrity, leadership, and caring looks like. Prayers and thoughts to all those impacted by this horrific tragedy. Lord Jesus please help all of us. Amen 🙏@warriors DEMS. The ball is in YOUR court.  DO SOMETHING !!!!!@dave_klopp @MarkMetzger7 @espn @Patrickqueen_ @warriors It’s only political if you don’t want to do anything about it. 

Otherwise it’s just wanting to prevent children from getting shot in elementary school.@barebearbaire @benjamintennar @ThomDevine @warriors It’s exactly what happened so doesn’t seem to preposterous to me.

It might make things a bit more difficult for people to attain guns.@SWaisanen @warriors Are you really advocating for more guns to combat mass murders?@GregAbbott_TX @NRA Take a lesson from @warriors’ Coach Steve Kerr: https://t.co/qzJPWYbhg5@espn @warriors I own 2 handguns.

If I need home protection, I will GLADLY submit to personal interviews by law enforcement before that request is granted.@warriors This is disgusting God save this world 😭😭😭@espn @warriors Steve Kerr gets it.

Then that begs the question, did you even watch the whole video? He was calling for universal background checks, even from private sellers, so there are no loopholes. Do you really have a problem with that?@blg1435 @espn @AdamSchefter @warriors Who says I am a Republican. I never said that.

Why is that so hard to answer? But yet so easy to say it needs to change.@Buscusriot @seaside1776 @warriors Most countries have guns banned and you also have to put into account that the us has a very high population compared to numerous other countries that allow guns, many other things as well but it doesn’t excuse any single death@SWaisanen @warriors libertarians are as if adults had the brains of babies@warriors That was so spot on. Thank you Steve Kerr!@warriors Yes, Steve Kerr. I’m with you !!!@ChrisRice0984 @espn @AdamSchefter @warriors I don't see him running for anything. He's a coach and you can see that when he's in a press conference telling everyone that he's not gonna talk about basketball because that's not the pressing issue. The shooting isn't even politics it's a tragedy.@GetAtMeMoore @warriors Do you know countries like Japan and many others have very low death with guns because their laws on gun control are very tight ?@RockHawk @rkevinm @espn @warriors Let me know the last time a gun killed someone or something on its own… I’ll wait…@espn @warriors Taking Americans weapons will never happen, however making them harder to obtain with an extensive background check and whatever else is needed to do so could be a viable option 🤷‍♂️@warriors My gawd I feel you pain Mr. Kerr, WHEN ARE WE GOING TO DO SOMETHING!!!!!!!!!!!!!@mike_burkett_ @Rastlet @espn @warriors Name a law that would have stopped this? Go ahead 🤡@warriors this right here ❤️@Buscusriot @seaside1776 @Rene_Rugeles @johhnnpp @warriors We already have a rigorous federal legislation that requires an FBI background check.

Instead, he talks about recent instances of gun violence: "14 children were killed 400 miles from here, and a teacher," he says. "...when are we going to do something?" https://t.co/eiUmexu2XlGolden State Warriors Starting Lineup 5/24

https://t.co/o75oZ8vnE8@WantGreatness @CornellEJones @seaside1776 @warriors A deranged 18 year old kid with a knife can maybe kill 1 or 2 people at most before getting stopped. Assuming he can even get that far. A kid with a gun can clear a whole classroom in minutes. Any death is bad but i think there is a clear difference between the two.@espn @warriors You hit the nail on the head, Steve!@RandySav95 @warriors Your god just let a bunch of children get massacred so miss us all with this@warriors Without bringing politics into this. Can we get to the root of the problem? Can there be more responsibility on the gun shop for selling the gun? There's gotta be a way to not sell guns to mentally unstable people without infringing on yOuR RiGhTs.@warriors This is entirely political.@espn @warriors Cuz the rest of the world, where this shit doesn’t happen, doesn’t have crazy folks.@warriors @Bucks fan checking in from Wisconsin. #Respect@espn @warriors Armed guards at our schools is what we need. We have armed guards at banks and malls. Are they more important than our children?@ThomDevine @warriors You know what’s worse than making something a political issue? LITTLE KIDS BEING MURDERED IN THEIR CLASS!!!! Absolutely GFY@warriors If we only had 40 billion sitting around somewhere w me could get security for all schools@MattJund @donato501 @unbiasedgswfan @espn @warriors The world is that black and white bud@IWP1977 @warriors They out there doesn't mean you can't limit their ability to be purchased and make them less available. You see one you confiscated them police wise. Start cleaning up the mess don't just say it's to big to ever fix. Like I said you can kill a lot more people with a gun@tharding316 @warriors I don't believe the guy was from Buffalo.   Drove over 3 hours to go there and shoot up innocent people@slickwilly888 @PardisonRodman @Dave1253S @espn @warriors I don’t know if it would have prevented it, but what’s the harm in enacting that bill? Just do it@GetAtMeMoore @warriors We haven't had a mass shooting in Australia since 1996 when strong gun laws were enacted.
Also Australians tend to deal with adversary with sick burns rather than violence.@warriors What we’re all thinking. 😢@GetAtMeMoore @warriors Compare our gun laws to the countries around the world that have common sense. Then compare the number of dead people. It’s obvious that the 300,000,000 guns in this country is the problem.@securityman63 @warriors False. We do not have universal background checks. Other countries have mental illness and scores of people are not slaughtered.@ScottFantasy @espn @warriors The kid with the two long guns? The video screen caps that show him holding a rifle? That one?@WantGreatness @CornellEJones @seaside1776 @warriors They’re calling for background checks on crazy ppl trying to get guns. How is that even up for debate? I’m off my meds, I try to get a gun and visit your kid’s school, and you have zero problem with that?@warriors 100% with Steve Kerr. Enough!@NickWhitley_ @warriors Dumb arguement. “People are going to rape people weather there’s a law or not. So let just make rape legal”@Dawglf1 @dukeskygaen @RealNBAExpert @espn @warriors Who buys things without having any reason for it? Weird@NapoleonIV10 @espn @AdamSchefter @warriors It might help prevent things like this from happening@warriors Its not a natural disasters! Enough is enough@ecramsfan8110 @messismofinito @warriors Have a nervous breakdown or psychotic episode and see if that’s still the case…@warriors @piersmorgan watch this@espn @warriors Why do we have the Senate when it is an obviously inherently flawed system?@SpotlessM @brokeycs @MountyNc @warriors You don’t understand economics@fritzglc @warriors @dallasmavs Same thing, I think they should either postpone the game, or collectively walk out.  Doesn't look like that will happen though.@warriors Well done Sir, America needs people like you speaking up.@espn @warriors Please concentrate on the game tonight, I have money on the Warriors.@JasonZellman @warriors Shootings don’t occur in other countries?😂@MountyNc @SpotlessM @warriors What’s the gun violence in Canada or England? Mischief lower that the US because they have strict gun laws. Anyone in Chicago can drive an hour and pickup a gun.@sheabeaux @unbiasedgswfan @espn @warriors You’d think in Texas of all places the kids would be safe in schools with so many armed citizens everywhere… oh wait…@Rumrunner11 @McLean_Deluxe @donato501 @unbiasedgswfan @espn @warriors Countries like Australia got completely out of control with their government overreach.@warriors We’re about to sweep this team ..@ezmoney247365 @GoldenBoys027 @AndrewMcEwan07 @warriors I don’t know, bout that one boss. The United States of America has had 126 mass shootings since 1982, 84 of which have been with guns purchased legally, 24 of which it is unknown or tbd, and 16 illegally. Having armed guards would just make them the shooters first target.@RAJohnson09 @MikeBraves2579 @jonjonweb85 @DWSFungicide @espn @warriors Great point, Ryan.@warriors It's a fair guess to say the majority of team owners support Rs for tax and labor benefits. #NBA@warriors Thank You!@CMK817 @McLean_Deluxe @GavB74 @donato501 @unbiasedgswfan @espn @warriors Sell it*@espn @warriors @warriors let's their coach lie about gun background checks.@SWaisanen @tFrankMurphy @warriors Ok genius, what about churches, grocery stores, movie theaters, etc.? What logic do you have to explain that one?@warriors @SethAbramson Steve shouldn’t be coach of the Warriors. He should be President of the United States.@espn @warriors The blood of the slain are on the GOP and the NRA because they cower in the “Shadow of the Federalists#”@GetAtMeMoore @warriors Does America then have the worst mental health in the world?  Is that what you're saying?  We have the worst by leaps and bounds?  No, we don't.  It's the access to firearms, plain and simple.@ThomDevine @warriors What the f*ck are you talking about. 10 school children and 1 teacher are dead. What other facts do you need. Universal background checks and assault weapon bans are common sense solutions to the rampant gun violence terrorizing America.@warriors Agree 100 percent with every thing he said, when is enough enough. Kids!@BonelessPeanut @slickwilly888 @PardisonRodman @Dave1253S @espn @warriors Because the Government has no business monitoring gun ownership. That’s why. Background checks hot n heavy in Chicago yet shootings/murders daily.@ThomDevine @warriors Are you serious? The fact is that Republicans are putting their power over the well-being of the people. No other country in the world lives trough this madness time and time again.@SWaisanen @warriors There is open carry in TX.@the_dridge @warriors Uh yes. The best way to protect yourself against something dangerous is to pose a threat to that danger. Shooters target areas where there are no protections in place.@warriors The pain runs deep...its written all over his face😔@MattSchlicher @unbiasedgswfan @espn @warriors nekkid arms he said@NapoleonIV10 @blg1435 @espn @AdamSchefter @warriors Did not say he did, i said he got an AR@warriors @NBA Right steve kerr you are on points ✍️@MountyNc @brokeycs @BlockChain187 @warriors Why did you tweet exactly like he said something intelligent lmao@SWaisanen @warriors Texas has literally some of the least restrictive laws in the entire country. Places with common sense gun laws, laws that even most gun owners support, have far less gun violence for the most part. The NRA thanks you for your service, but you’re full of shit.@RandySav95 @warriors Keep God out of politics-@TSN_Sports @warriors Good bloke@JohnEngelbert_ @warriors There's mental health issues in every country, America has a gun issue - it's the country with the biggest mass shooting issues@warriors Thank you.@RandySav95 @warriors Dude what god? The one that killed these kids?@warriors I agree with you Coach! It's time to end this type of suffering.@Dz1005 @warriors having a majority in senate when senators have their own strong allegiances is sort of moot. You also have the filibuster there, so not really.@jcbcarlitos @Its_S1mple @espn @AdamSchefter @warriors It was hyperbole to bring down a point which you obviously didnt get. You remind me of this guy

https://t.co/J0i7pSxXMT@JustinWeinstei9 @nFamousOneuhB @ThomDevine @warriors What if you had a brain and actually thought of someone other than yourself. It's shitty people like you who are the problem. Simple legislative action can and should be taken to try to prevent killings like this.@CHHS50 @alfarochris25 @unbiasedgswfan @espn @warriors It’s not the cartels man, it’s Americans.yes they cornered drug trade once we made it illegal here,but AMERICANS,will corner the GUN trade here if illegal. It would be much worse than what it is now(no matter how terrible/demonic/evil it is) it would double. We dug our own grave.@warriors @Amanda_Balionis Don’t disagree with being fed up BUT laws don’t not do anything for criminals. They simply don’t care@espn @AdamSchefter @warriors He has a platform, came ready with facts and served up cold hard truth that we NEED TO CHANGE. This shit is unacceptable@espn @warriors Respect.@warriors @SethAbramson 50 god damn @GOP senators. #Enough@TheEvanMcDowell @DavidMoss21 @ecramsfan8110 @messismofinito @warriors But it kind of is. Not looking everyone up but I can almost bet 4/5 of them where on their radar. The Buffalo loser was. So was this psycho@WantGreatness @warriors He’s not talking about taking away the guns. He is advocating for responsible gun ownership and background checks on applicants. Nothing wrong with that. Won’t stop those who already have guns but will reduce the likelihood of someone getting a gun who has a valid reason not to.@warriors Righteous indignation! Go Dubs!!@erinmarie0922 @warriors Go to math class! You need it@therealselena23 @espn @warriors Very very very very very very very rare W@jimmy68camaro @RyanKbunyan @PeterTrapino @McLean_Deluxe @donato501 @unbiasedgswfan @espn @warriors Yes I think the ship has sailed on guns but they should be harder to obtain.  A gun should be harder to get than a drivers license@dukeskygaen @Dawglf1 @RealNBAExpert @espn @warriors This is my point, what do you do with your AR-15? Stare at it? You’re not using it unless you’re at a gun range or using it for sport, both stupid excuses, and the “I need it for protection” is also a dumb excuse. You don’t live in a warzone@warriors @NBA Walk off the court to protest gun violence and legislative inaction. 
Today is not a day for games in Texas.@espn @warriors I wonder if he is that passionate about killing millions of babies by abortion. Prayers for all the families!@GetAtMeMoore @warriors GFY, Fool@espn @warriors I'm tired too

Let's hope it doesn't go to waste!@ThomDevine @warriors It's a political issue and 14 children were killed because of it

Which other facts do you want? Because these are more than enough for me and anyone sane@espn @warriors I'm tired as well and it hurts 🙏😔@espn @warriors Why isn’t he wearing his mask@warriors @dallasmavs @mcuban @SteveKerr I have an idea. Refuse to play until senators vote on background checks. We will wait for basketball #UvaldeTX@SWaisanen @warriors Stopping an active shooter requires extensive training. And if law enforcement sees two people with guns during an active shooting, both are getting shot on the spot.

Open-carry laws wouldn't do shit.@SWaisanen @warriors or, ya know, just do what steve is saying and make it hard to get a gun. it should be fucking hard. it’s hard to vote in this country@warriors please close this out 🙏🏾@GetAtMeMoore @warriors Absolutely wrong. We are the only country in the western world that can’t this right.@warriors This is exactly how I feel.  I've had enough.@BCrew211 @jonjonweb85 @DWSFungicide @espn @warriors Is that what happened here?

Such great basketball being witnessed. Gotta respect that if you are a basketball fan!@MikeBraves2579 @BCrew211 @jonjonweb85 @DWSFungicide @espn @warriors These aren’t the same things though. This is supply and demand. If you regulate and possibly even ban certain types of guns they will become extremely hard to come by. Cut the demand and the supply will shrink because MOST people can just make their own guns.@danielf90737561 @Nin3rswarri3rs @warriors They care so little they'll set up things like this to push their agenda.

And it’s not going to harm anyone.@espn @warriors Tell'em Steve!!!!@TheNightIsDark7 @melucahoney @DavidMoss21 @ecramsfan8110 @messismofinito @warriors I don’t think you can ban guns. Too late for that. I think you extend and do longer background checks.

I agree with a lot of people that changing a law here or there won’t change a lot. Background checks seem reasonable, however.@espn @AdamSchefter @warriors I don’t understand why more women and men in government don’t have similar views. Incredible@WantGreatness @warriors Yah, the point is how does one kill 18 people in a matter of minutes with a knife…answer, they DON’T.@tFrankMurphy @warriors Pretty sure you’re not allowed to open carry on school grounds.

Sensible Americans like you are fed up as well. Things have to change. They simply have to. 😭@tweeder530 @warriors A gun law can stop broken people from getting a gun. Which is what you motherfuckers refuse to understand.@unbiasedgswfan @espn @warriors Because taking guns really stop the violence huh. Criminals will have guns the normal people that just want to protect themselves will be without so what is fair?@securityman63 @warriors Bullshit.

Texas has no such background checks. 

And “mental health” is just the latest buzz phrase that the right uses now to distract from the real problem. They used to get away with “thoughts and prayers” but that’s not working anymore. So now they say it’s “mental health”.@warriors We’re not just tired.. we’re getting use to these shootings. That’s the scariest part.@warriors Thank you Steve Kerr for speaking up... Thank you@warriors Thank you so much Coach Kerr. We share your grief and frustration Thank you for naming names!

you really want to move the needle, refuse to take the court.@seaside1776 @warriors It’s a start@RareEditionCo @warriors @StephenCurry30 @PaniniAmerica Where graded hockey at?@RIMonTheRim1 @DavidMoss21 @ecramsfan8110 @warriors This would be a good argument if it was correct, in countries like Australia, Canada and teh UK, who have similar unemployment numbers to the US, there are almost 0 gun murders annually. Its almost as if gun laws work?@i_am_jiggy @seaside1776 @warriors Definitely ways to change things. Might not eliminate things but who knows if today would’ve happened@warriors Let's ASK for the IMMEDIATE resignation of the 50 senators now. They are failing 90% of Americans. In any other context, they would be FIRED, TERMINATED IMMEDIATELY.@StephenCurry30 @warriors @StephenCurry30 WALK OFF THE COURT!!!!!!@espn @warriors A Mexican transgender did this shooting. It’ll be buried in 2 days@warriors Thank you Steve for saying publicly what all decent people want to scream at this guncrazy nation !@espn @warriors I felt that Kerr@TeflonStefann @Chiefs534891322 @warriors Yea because cars are made with intention to kill, its really almost comparable except its not.
Also getting a drivers license is infinitely hard then getting a gun so you might just be the dumbest man alive.@warriors THIS GUY 👆👆👆@unbiasedgswfan @espn @warriors It's called the 2nd Amendment.

That and not having stuff like this staged so they can push gun laws and rile up voters for midterms. Dems not coming out for primary so they have to do something.

LOL@GeoffHutchison @warriors @abcperth A glimmer of hope for a sick country?? ….. mind you I thought there was hope of gun reform after Sandy Hook@warriors The American people need to get this angry and vote them out!!@warriors Thank you Coach. You spoke for all of us.@SWaisanen @warriors Didn’t know little kids should carry a firearm while at school.@warriors So true.This is one reason I appreciate the Warriors organization: Golden State Warriors head coach Steve Kerr says lawmakers opposing gun control "hold us hostage" https://t.co/MlOnOHklLU@ChrisRice0984 @espn @AdamSchefter @warriors He's a basketball coach not a politician. His job is not to talk about every issue in society. The shooting was a horrific act and it's different than every little thing about society.@DeBallZachNBA @deballzachnba Seriously? Where’s the proof @warriors Steve Kerr said what you quoted? More like a slander @WarriorsPR@jkbjournalist Bravo and thanks to @Warriors @SteveKerr for speaking the unvarnished truth. More of this leadership, please, from all corners.@ThomDevine @warriors Bro what@brokeycs @BlockChain187 @MountyNc @warriors You think your AR-15 is protecting your from the US military? Are you dead ass? I promise you if the government wanted to oppress you, they would.@LordYoungBoy @ChrisVanBueller @2_schafer @warriors What’s your plan for keeping Soviet handguns out of the hands of Islamic Jihad organizations? Also, how is this national terrorism when Malcolm Kerr was murdered in Beirut, Lebanon?@benjamintennar @ThomDevine @warriors I agree, but like japan its easier for smaller countries to do this.  I mean just look at how americans act already, we can't even obey speed laws let along some other laws.@BayAreaSportsF7 @warriors He's come a long way. Proud he was a Bull https://t.co/1IlvMViTC5@MikeBraves2579 @jonjonweb85 @DWSFungicide @espn @warriors Dude. Really?! Drugs and DUI’s are completely different then some random kid walking in to a gun store and purchasing an assault rifle without any kind of background check.@PaulsLastStand @TheEvanMcDowell @DavidMoss21 @ecramsfan8110 @messismofinito @warriors Then what’s the hold up with red flag laws &amp; nationwide databases?! Those could’ve prevented how many shootings? If you’re a responsible gun owner fantastic! Then you should have zero problems with universal background checks and sensible gun laws.@seaside1776 @warriors You'll never 100% prevent it but if you don't think it can be considerably reduced you're not very smart. Plenty of examples across the world.@warriors Sadly American culture is a bit rotten. You guys are in this crazy pressure cooker of "everything". Until the culture of guns and glorifying that entire part of your culture is addressed, you can pass any law you like, it won't stop.

Other countries have guns and don't have this@NBAonTNT @dallasmavs @warriors I think @dallasmavs gonna win tonight as the warriors like to celebrate in their home court 💛🖤💪@DecklinNagel @espn @AdamSchefter @warriors I own a few firearms, never had a background check. Its an issue. I'd be glady to do one cause I can pass. Arkansas has such loose gun laws that people don't even have to register their firearms in the state and its an open carry state. I'm all for guns but we need stricter laws.@warriors I stand with Coach Kerr🙏🏿@dave_klopp @MarkMetzger7 @espn @Patrickqueen_ @warriors Because LAWS are meant to PROTECT PEOPLE in a DEMOCRACY.

You’re against universal background checks? You’re the minority.@warriors Thank you for speaking up!!@warriors Taking guns away from law abiding citizens is not the answer. How about actually hiring more police officers or school security? Oh wait you want to defund the police I forgot.@espn @jaketapper @warriors He speaks for millions.@ThomDevine @letstalkshoes22 @warriors Why does your face look autistic? You’re right tho@ecramsfan8110 @messismofinito @warriors Why does anyone need a gun? If no one had one, there wouldn’t be a “need to protect myself”. Only the police should be allowed to have guns and the way that’s going, they need a good background check to be a police officer.@warriors They should put finger print signatures that unlocks trigger lock and up the age of buying a firearm to 25 as well as background intensive background checks.@DavidMoss21 @ecramsfan8110 @messismofinito @warriors Sorry. They actively do try to make certain guns illegal and attachments illegal etc.  The point of the 2nd amendment is to be able to defend against an invading force or a government overreach. So u need all the firepower u can get@warriors Thank you coach!!@SWaisanen @warriors This happened in Texas where open carry is a thing. Guess the guy wasn’t deterred nor anyone did anything.@espn @warriors What happened in Texas is horrible!  However, hard to take this guy seriously given his support for China@ThomDevine @warriors Whaaat???  You seriously think it isn’t a political issue??  What planet do you live on?  Clearly, you’re not from here.@warriors Steve Kerr...
This is spot on.
Thank you!!!@warriors Very powerful; good for you Steve Kerr.I’m calling on you @warriors @luka7doncic @dallasmavs @StephenCurry30 @mcuban do something #boycottnbaplayoffs https://t.co/nsJrGYUzs9@unbiasedgswfan @espn @warriors We banned heroin and meth. Still have overdoses and drug dealers right? Exactly. Evil will find a way. Regulating and restricting the law abiding citizen doesn't lower crime, it makes crime go up cause the offender knows there's no chance of retaliation.@warriors Release the crime scene pictures from inside the school. This "debate" would be over tomorrow.@warriors Kerr is right! Republicans in the Senate refuse to do anything to keep guns out of the hands of mentally ill people because they are afraid of losing votes from the far right radicals!@sportingnews @warriors 👍 Great speech! Enough is enough! Only in America, but nowhere else!@ThomDevine @warriors It is fucking political because republicans don’t wanna get rid of guns. Stop making excuses for shitty laws@RTNBA @jacksettleman @warriors These are the messages that need to be heard. You can agree or disagree. That's a choice we all get to make.

Just vote for one who will do something.@warriors @SenTuberville @SenShelby Please be a MAN and please stand up to the NRA and reject their Bribes, and do something to decrease the KILLINGS of the kids and our grandparents. Please have the CDC do the research.  Please pass sensible regulations!  "IT'S PATHETIC. IIVE HAD ENOUGH!"@warriors Amazing response, but this should never have to happen@dave_klopp @espn @Patrickqueen_ @warriors Fuck ur prayers they don’t do shit cause next week this will happen again at a different location@warriors how about offering some solutions instead of blaming hard working people@espn @warriors DITTO!! I am FURIOUS!!@GetAtMeMoore @warriors Wrong. Guns are definitely a big part of the problem.

😞@warriors W Steve Kerr but he’s right this violence has to stop it’s to much the buffalo shooting and now this shooting all in the span of 2 weeks 😕…@warriors @HeadlinerClip caption@warriors @carlquintanilla Damn right Steve. Thank you for saying it@espn @SJSciarra @warriors Steve for President@warriors Have every NBA player/coach/owner donate half of their 2023 salary to a gun buy back program. Guaranteed to get tens of thousands of guns off streets in ever NBA city We have all had enough but put your money where your anger is!!!!!!!@ThomDevine @warriors But it is a political issue.

Your comment about all of these people being on the feds’ radar is not supported by facts.@warriors I am one of those 90%. DO SOMETHING you NRA owned Republicans!!!

This is political as conservatives are more concerned about their jobs then saving lives! When will this madness stop? You would feel differently if you went to pick up your child at school only to learn he/she was gunned down! This country is a mess due to MAGA@ThomDevine @warriors I honestly don’t care if the kid found the gun in a sewer,  Steve’s point still stands@warriors It’s not blacks fault@warriors @jordsrsly How many more times will we sit here and watch a crowd of defenseless people die before finally realizing being defenseless isn’t the answer?@espn @warriors No one cares what this liberal has to say. He’s going to use a terrible tragedy to push a political agenda. 

How about instead of spending $40 billion on a war - the government spends $40 billion to make school safe.@warriors @SethAbramson Steve Kerr is a real one. Thank God for men like this. 🖖@SWaisanen @warriors Yeah b/c of all the shootings that occur in other countries…wait they don’t happen.@warriors Glad Steve Kerr can make this about him@warriors Thank you for using your public podium@for good.

Perfect cannot be the enemy of good.@warriors Thank god someone’s speaking what so many of us are feeling!  Good bless you for not allowing anyone to silence you!  Your words were dead on!  Those trying to hold onto their power are a bunch of cowards. Using our children, grandchildren,etc as human shields for their benefit!@warriors Only in the USA .

Senators … get those prayer sessions happening . What a joke .@angolakennels @warriors @ESPNBooger How the fuck is that even something that’s in your mind? Has less than nothing to do with this.@ThomDevine @warriors I am sick of this narrative! The deaths of children at school is NOT “political”. What the duck is wrong with you?!@ThomDevine @warriors Wtf are the facts kids got fucking murdered and it's absolutely heart breaking and it's bullshit. 

Schools are supposed to be safe. Kids should not have to worry about any of this. THEY ARE CHILDREN!!@warriors These victims don't need our silence!!
They need us to speak up!!
To shout &amp; scream for it to STOP!!@Rob_Roth @nickbladen10 @unbiasedgswfan @espn @warriors Australia is great. That being said bad people who want to get a gun will still do so. People that cant get a firearm will just use another weapon and you’re crazy if you think that if someone threatens your life that the police will be there in time to save you.@warriors I would imagine that the schools where these senators children or grandchildren go to school have plenty of security.

NONE of these things mean you can't have your fucking small dick compensation.@warriors Take one of theirs away and see what happens then. People only learn through first hand experience.

When is enough for you ?  It is a political issue when we can’t get a vote. To protect our families we can’t get a vote.@warriors Steve Kerr thank you. #Enough!@warriors With all sympathy &amp; empathy felt for ALL of the families involved,do we think that a background check is going to stop a deranged killer from accessing the means to find a way to commit these heinous acts? I think not.  This is a  matter of the heart. Put God back into the schoolTo watch NBA Game: Golden State Warriors vs Dallas Mavericks stream go to link in tweet below:

CLICK   ====v https://t.co/vc1bjrBaPA@MikeBraves2579 @jcbcarlitos @Its_S1mple @espn @AdamSchefter @warriors So what is wrong with background checks? Clearly it won’t stop criminals from getting guns illegally nor will it be 100% effective but doing the same thing over and over again - in this case doing nothing - Is the definition of insanity. Clearly something needs to change!@seaside1776 @warriors Except in every single other country on the PLANET.Maybe, instead, or in addition to, a moment of silence, the @warriors should honor the dead and their coach’s words and offer some moments of screaming at do-nothing legislators. https://t.co/0T7LotZUoK@warriors 100% this is how I feel. I’m so ANGRY!!@SWaisanen @warriors You’re aware that Texas allows open carry without a permit, right? Wanna try that again?@SpotlessM @warriors You mean Republicans do nothing@securityman63 @warriors People with mental health diagnoses are far more at risk for being VICTIMS of violence then perpetrators. PLEASE STOP the lazy conflation of mental illness to violence, the vast majority of mentally ill people are NOT violent.@warriors He is where the majority of Americans are right now. We’re tired of being held hostage by the GOP.@warriors Thank You Coach for your passion. I hope our Congressional‘leaders’ were listening and start to act like people with a heart@Dave1253S @espn @warriors That’s not a universal thing. You can easily buy a gun here in Texas without a background check LEGALLY.@ThomDevine @warriors Guns don’t kill.  People do.Don’t get out there n play with yah food. We need it. @warriors@unbiasedgswfan @espn @warriors Believe it or not, the majority of gun owners are responsible. They clean them properly. They unload them. They lock them up. They teach their children to respect them. They use them as guns were intended, tools not weapons.Not only is this the coach of the Golden State Warriors but man, this a man who has sat here before echoing these words, but not like this. POWERFUL. Listen 👇🏼 https://t.co/EJIKOHxCz7@dave_klopp @espn @Patrickqueen_ @warriors Does it fucking matter that he’s a dem, does he need to give prayers.

Where did you study  again?@warriors Let’s get this W@Tzacher2001 @benjamintennar @ThomDevine @warriors “even if they’re was criminal background checks the man still would of done this since he was 18”

What does that mean?@warriors Steve ker should not only be fined but suspended for rant dragging politics into it. He should’ve just gave his Condolences. Let’s look at logic this didn’t always happen yet guns have always been around. It’s a variable that hasn’t changed even tho type of incidents have.@rkevinm @espn @warriors The issue is we are to sympathetic to so said mental health patients and all those who use to be put away are now roaming amongst the innocent public and then here we are with situations like today. They need to be isolated from the general public until they are deemed stable@blanco_ember @duttboireacts @warriors Coaches can’t cancel games anyway.@warriors HC Steve Kerr on today’s shooting in #Uvalde #Texas. #NBA #GoldBlooded #dALLasIN https://t.co/1uBvDWLFGPWarriors Head Coach Steve Kerr gives a strong plea for gun reform following the mass shooting at Robb Elementary in Uvalde, TX.

This is what happens when you live in a society that is immoral and ungodly.@VPECards @nbastats @warriors @DKSportsbook Still no update to Green’s rebounds!!??? Wtf@warriors Yes they are going to put their own desire for power over the lives of children

The GOP doesn't care about dead kids@warriors Immediately going to politics!!!! Without knowing ANY FACTS! Come on@WantGreatness @spikeatone @warriors Stop it. 4 minutes to kill 18 with a knife????  Stop it. But they go ahead, make any excuse to keep guns readily available to unqualified disturbed people. That’s all you all ever do…..guns over life.@ThomDevine @warriors What facts!? Kids got shot and killed at school, you can’t just wait for facts.@McLean_Deluxe @Zero_zaey @unbiasedgswfan @espn @warriors No, they buy ghost guns and put them together themselves, they’re not stealing them from stores or owners🙄@Firesto93188622 @unbiasedgswfan @espn @warriors Wouldn't solve anything because people who want guns would still get them. Just like when alcohol was illegal people still got it. Same thing with weed when it was illegal people still find ways to get it &amp; smoke it. "banning" does nothing in reality@ThomDevine @warriors What facts do we not have? Jesus, Get a clue, man.@warriors Run for office and make a change. Until then, you’re just another person speaking your mind.@warriors Wow! Well said Coach Kerr!@warriors He lost all credibility when he fellated China and shrugged off the Uygur camps as normal social policy. He knows where is bread is buttered.@JustinWeinstei9 @nFamousOneuhB @ThomDevine @warriors Oh honey... hooooooney...@warriors @MasJenks and the tnt crew opened up with a good segment on it@warriors Thank you for speaking out🙏🏻😔💔@klaysupremacy @warriors yessir@NapoleonIV10 @Noah_789_ @espn @AdamSchefter @warriors Exactly. You are good with it. You have that right. All I’m saying is people should be prepared for bad things to happen when anyone can go get an assault rifle whenever they want.@warriors say it like it fucking is coach@LebronRaymore @Guiller16777274 @klaysburner @warriors The only way you can get any sort of attention is making fun of 8 year old kids dying I hope you find your purpose@micnificent28 @warriors They’re already out there and nothing can be done about that. The 2A exists for a reason and it’s not for hunting or target shooting. Blaming the gun is blaming the spoon for obesity.@warriors @soIoucity Mental health crisis in our country. Our school system is broken. fix that, fix these shootings.@warriors Prior veteran here for gun rights. The fact that people claim mental health can be deemed by the government standards is ridiculous. This government led by a dementia patient can't be run that way.@ThomDevine @warriors Are you fucking KIDDING?@warriors Amen!@warriors Well said!@espn @warriors I bet Steve Kerr supports the war in Ukraine tho@jonjonweb85 @DWSFungicide @espn @warriors Fyi- during the assault weapons ban, mass shootings dropped 40-50%. It didn't stop all,obviously, but there was a huge drop. It worked.  Not perfectly, but it did some good.@ThomDevine @warriors People like you are why nothing gets done@jose_briseno620 @espn @warriors It won’t. I mean it’s def sad af and I get wanting to do something to prevent this but I don’t see gun laws doing much. If you ban them completely you have a civil war. If so something inbetween it still doesn’t stop someone from getting one. There are MILLIONS of guns out there.@paulyblanco7260 @NBAonTNT @dallasmavs @warriors As a lifelong Dubs fan who lives a few blocks from Chase center I say don’t give up hope, if Dallas is good enough they’ll extend the series if for no other reason than pride. If we were down 0-3 I’d focus one only the game at hand@warriors I know if I lost a loved one a niece,sister,daughter,son to gun violence it hurt 😞 how did this 18 yr old kid get gun ? probably his pops then they say something has to change but nothing is ever done !@NapoleonIV10 @gabeski2607 @rkevinm @espn @warriors Yeah you mean muskets? Not fucking assault rifles@warriors BRAVO!!! and thank you!@RJClean @nFamousOneuhB @ThomDevine @warriors Taking my guns won’t fix that@Jahnisalami @jonjonweb85 @unbiasedgswfan @espn @warriors Oh look, one of the uneducated morons have shown themselves.

I get why he’s passionate about it.@dave_klopp @espn @Patrickqueen_ @warriors There’s no mention of prayers because prayers won’t bring the kids back to their families. He’s talking about things that can actually happen if the politicians would stop being politicians and start being people@securityman63 @warriors STOP BLAMING MENTAL ILLNESS! It is the guns. It has always been the guns.@StephenCurry30 @warriors Kerr is speaking for everybody right now 👏🏾👏🏻@warriors When will we give up our guns like civilized nations like Venezuela did. That really worked.@espn @warriors He needs to be on every news channel.@espn @warriors All class. Most robust response to the continued intentional insanity of America &amp; its obsession with guns &amp; zero accountability. Steve Kerr has more humanity in his pinky than the miserable 50 power salivating senators in their collective existence as so called ‘humans.’@_TheBoy_25 @espn @warriors what is wrong with you? The lack of empathy you show just shows the type of person you are@unbiasedgswfan @espn @warriors If you ban guns all the guns don’t disappear so then more criminals get hands on them and less civilians can protect themselves@warriors THAT'S. MY. FUCKING. HEAD. COACH.@AtxPatty @baby_face_goat @warriors Yeah I totally understand, I’m Canadian and everyday the internet reminds me how lucky I have it. America in its current state is a fucking train wreck and the people have got to change something because nobody else will@warriors And we’ll get Walker…sheesh@ecramsfan8110 @messismofinito @warriors Well clearly the whole good guys with guns theory isn’t working since practically anyone can get one that wants one.

You're not. Oh, and we have background checks.@richy0731 @BIGTOMSWORLD @espn @warriors Why is it that only gun stores have to do background checks?

Don't speak on them!!@warriors When is it going to be ENOUGH! #EndGunViolence #GunControlNow@ecramsfan8110 @messismofinito @warriors You know there are thousands, maybe millions of guns out there in the wrong hands - those are the guns that need to be removed.

https://t.co/nFGCN2NipY@JustinWeinstei9 @nFamousOneuhB @ThomDevine @warriors We don’t need to ask that what if because the vast majority of our mass shooters are domestic terrorists, home grown right here in the US of A@chung_cr @espn @AdamSchefter @warriors Whether or not that specific bill being passed would've prevented this specific shooting is irrelevant. If it even has the potential to prevent a percentage of attacks it should be passed. It's a start, and it's a common sense bill, which I think was Kerr's point 🙃@ThomDevine @warriors Fact is that kids where gunned down by a kid who was barely old enough to have 1. I hope u r a troll cas that was the dumbest shit ive ever heard.

This is simply a deflection from the matters at hand@ArcieriJohn @warriors I’m not a fan of him either he’s the furthest from being godly.

Thank you for using your platform to bring attention to the political bs that holds up universal background checks@unbiasedgswfan @espn @warriors They think they can overthrow the govt@espn @warriors He’s so fake. Brings politics into with seconds. Gun control bills won’t do anything to prevent tragedies. It’s not a gun problem. It’s a mental health problem. But loony’s in the loony bin and these would occur less. See Chicago 4proof gun control doesn’t equate to less violence@NapoleonIV10 @eternallyboard @espn @warriors Yes it was. It was also supposed to be a document that changes and adapts to the times. But people like you are stuck in the past and think a constitution created 250 years ago when guns were single shot barrel loaded muskets still makes sense for todays weapons.@Shannonfrye2015 @unbiasedgswfan @espn @warriors Gun bans have worked in the past such as Australia, banned guns in 1996 and there hasn’t been a mass shooting since. The USA should not be on par with third world countries with mass shootings, this is suppose to be the greatest country in the world.@ThomDevine @warriors Political? How about reality. While I won’t allow the actions an eighteen year old to define our Constitutional Democracy, neither should we allow selfish, desensitized, idiot white people(stuck somewhere between 1870 and 1990) to set the American standard. ENOUGH@espn @warriors Senator Inhofe is one of the Republicans who won’t pass the background check bill. 

https://t.co/AmCvV8FznW@warriors Like Steve more of us must speak up, stop voting for people to the US Senate who are willing to kiss our collective asses to get elected, promising to take us to the promised  land, but once they are senators, they forget our needs. LET'S STOP VOTING THEM IN.@securityman63 @warriors Yeah because mental illness is limited to only people in the united states lol... The difference is guns and how easily they can kill large amounts of people in a matter of seconds. Any person who isn't stupid could figure that out@warriors This is so powerful but doing background checks isn’t enough it’s way to easy for ppl to get guns most of these shootings are by 18.19 or 20 years old who can’t purchase them so they are taking them from their parents getting them illegally etc and Idk how they stop that sadly@TheCount721 @rkevinm @espn @warriors Everything but the guns. Always everything but the guns.@ThomDevine @warriors S......T......F........U........!!!!!!!@espn @warriors All Republicans..smh....@warriors He’s 💯correct!

When was the last school shooting that was used with an illegally obtained gun? Are you going to sit here and say we can’t do anything about it? When do we change?@espn @warriors Who cares what this man says ? And why ?@espn @warriors Goosebumps..

He’s not wrong.@RTNBA @warriors common W from Steve, 🙏🏾@warriors I felt this in my soul.@unbiasedgswfan @espn @warriors Bc out government on both sides don't care about us. They use everything for political gains. If there's nothing to gain it doesn't matter. Well protest criminals but there's zero people protesting for this. It's whatever media tells us to do. Instead of blaming the government we@warriors All athletes, entertainers and everyone with some vocal power need to speak out on this, I’m not even American or live in the states, but your country can find a needle in a sandstorm, but can’t stop children getting shot it school, THATS CRAZY@PaulsLastStand @DavidMoss21 @ecramsfan8110 @messismofinito @warriors Keep it duh@PhillyStr0ng @cheznico_ @securityman63 @warriors once a decade is not the same as once a month@espn @warriors Appreciate the passion but he has no idea what he is talking about. All this senators holding people hostage is only an inflammatory lie. As if background checks are going to solve this.@warriors This is so sad. Unfortunately, we are numb. I am sick of prayers and moments of silence. We need action. I would like the GOP to tell the American people how many people have to die in one mass shooting in order for the GOP to take action. How does the GOP sleep at night?@warriors @o_biennis Thank you Coach ❤️@warriors Thanks @SteveKerr for your heartfelt words 🙏🏼🦋@espn @AdamSchefter @warriors Why don’t the 50 Democrats vote on the bill he’s referencing and then have Kamala break the tie?  How many votes do they need besides the 50 + the V.P.?@warriors @ToddYoungIN @SenatorBraun 
What is more important to you--getting reelected? 
Or saving lives?

If it's saving lives, what is your plan to end gun violence and white supremacy? And where's your budget?@LoserBunny69420 @PotatoHeadBiden @RealNBAExpert @espn @warriors Assuming he gave up his gun. Right? I hope he didn't bury it when the gestapo is going through his neighborhood and dig it up later.@AndrewMcEwan07 @warriors I agree... I also think that if it was a regular season game and not the playoffs, it would have been more likely@warriors We've had enough!!!!@warriors @karmaoptions God Bless you Steve Kerr! #GunControlNowA little @NICKMERCS in this Chipotle Tourney and @warriors go for the Sweep. Day Off vibes are set up perfectly. #MFAM #DubNation@ThomDevine @warriors Is that right?@CrustyFlacko @Jmart2233 @warriors hahahaha keep going. you are simply making yourself out to look like an even bigger fool than you already are!@espn @warriors We need a lot more people like Steve Kerr.@ThomDevine @warriors The fact you think this is political.@warriors Action@warriors Disgusting.  Barely a peep about those who lost their lives, but sure wants to talk politics.@JevadRol @Nin3rswarri3rs @warriors Republican, Democrat, who cares, our government fails us every day that there aren’t any changes. Whether it’s gun rights, civil rights, the economy, etc etc. Blaming a part doesn’t fix the whole, we need to come together to fix the issue, not point blame at one another.@GoldenBoys027 @AndrewMcEwan07 @warriors u didnt listen to what he said, take action now, cause in a week this will be forgotten and we sit and wait till this happens again@CammyMacLachlan @Pats_Fan_603 @McLean_Deluxe @donato501 @unbiasedgswfan @espn @warriors They (pro gun people) didnt do shit in 1801, they whipped slaves instead.. @warriors @dallasmavs you guys should boycott the game tonight! How can you guys play a basketball game in Texas tonight after that mass shooting?! Steve’s emotional &amp; furious press conference says it all!!! #EnoughIsEnough @NBA @NBAonTNT @TurnerSportsEJ @SHAQ @TheJetOnTNT@zenyatamond8a @securityman63 @warriors How soon people forget this fact....@wrongagainkevin @cheznico_ @securityman63 @warriors Guns are significantly easier to get into the United States illegally than in Australia.  

I’m not trying to be insensitive here and I do think change of some sort should be done but within reason.  You will never be able to ban guns in America without triggering a revolution.@ThomDevine @warriors Shut upIma need a sweep @warriors 🫡@eternallyboard @espn @warriors Lets get prescription drugs out of our kids. That is the true cause of this violence.@MountyNc @warriors Poverty is link to crimes. That is why I said we need multiple solutions. Pass UBI and gun laws.@ThomDevine @warriors What is it then.@espn @thegoodgodabove @warriors Wasted words unfortunately.@securityman63 @warriors You have no more mental health issues than any other country in the world. You're so unbearably wrong.@rkevinm @espn @warriors This is a more complex, nuanced issue than just a gun debate. It goes way deeper into the actual mental state of where our society is as a country right now. Yes there needs to be stricter gun laws but it won't solve the core issue.@warriors This message is on point on all respects.  Good for you coach!@ThomDevine @warriors Please go away. And by go away, I mean you should seriously consider introducing a foreign object into your personal space… For Science.@espn @warriors Taking Guns away from Americans isn’t the answer. Putting God back is the answer.@warriors W person.@DJcrocker @espn @warriors Ok so what is your solution?Warriors Steve Kerr emotionally talks about what happened today at a school in Uvalde, Texas.

https://t.co/Y2dut9vJpm@warriors this tragic event in Texas is ine of horror and disbelief. I can appreciate your coach's sentiment but his comments are I'll placed. He turned his comments political and it tarnished his message. This is about mental health and poor parenting.@BasedElon777 @nickbladen10 @MattSchlicher @unbiasedgswfan @espn @warriors “No person shall be…deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law…” . 🤡@securityman63 @warriors WRONG. If I buy a gun at a yard sale or from my neighbor or at a gun show from someone who isn't a licensed weapons dealer, I do NOT have to have a background check done. Mental health challenges have always been with us, so why are mass shootings happening all the time NOW??@NapoleonIV10 @DecklinNagel @espn @AdamSchefter @warriors Dude said in most cases💀 should be in all cases@DcDc22941350 @espn @warriors Assassinated or murdered?@warriors Amen, Steve!!

It’s fucking sick.@TD_Meyers @3000Elsinore @securityman63 @warriors I mean that's what these people are saying. Weird my gun has never done that.@FistfulOfTeeth4 @walk_79 @benjamintennar @ThomDevine @warriors And that second amendment should not come at the cost of all these innocent lives. And wait until you figure out what the word amendment means and that the US Constitution can still be amended.@warriors The answer from GOP will be, 'Yes, Power &gt; Lives'. That's if they even have the guts to admit it.@espn @warriors This is how you use your voice &amp; platform!@warriors I love Steve Kerr.Golden State Warriors coach Steve Kerr, "Not going to talk about basketball. Any basketball questions don’t matter. I’m tired, I'm so tired of getting up here and offering condolences. I'm tired of the moments of silence." https://t.co/VwQhCBukNY@ThomDevine @warriors The fact I wanna hear is why does this 18-year-old have access to a machine gun.@warriors What should we do then? Yall stay outraged yet have no answers whatsoever. Like you don't need a background check to purchase weapons.@warriors @JaneVoter2018 Thank YOU Steve, for reaching a whole other audience!@JeremyR86 @MattSchlicher @unbiasedgswfan @espn @warriors And the earth was flat … man you need a class in history https://t.co/XS5KxlDENx@DixonThompson2 @WantGreatness @warriors You don’t think he would’ve killed his grandma another way.

Wtf are you talking about?@warriors Gun violence won’t stop with changing laws. Idk how many people have to be told that people kill people not guns. Guns aren’t hard to obtain illegally and to be honest anyone who can follow directions can make one pretty easily. Mental health is a much bigger issue!@espn @warriors Oh fuck yes!!!!@f8th4lyf_2 @PidgeyRS @warriors I did not know that@Bacccup1 @ecramsfan8110 @messismofinito @warriors sorry we have to take your car away anyway tho. you never know when you might get into an accident and we can’t take that chance. it keeps everyone safer, i’m sure you understand!@FWI_Warrior @warriors Bro, why don’t you stick to chik fil a, nobody wants to hear your takes on an NBA coach.@warriors There needs to be change, that protect and helps us ALL. I hope that what stands in the way of saving lives isn't the voting of a few people.@securityman63 @warriors No! We don’t need guns! You wake up!@warriors Period he said it perfectly we are tired of the violence. It’s Heartbreaking@unbiasedgswfan @espn @warriors To keep the power with the people,  not the government@warriors Oh shut up Kerr! Stop blaming a political party, look at what AntiFa is doing in your own state! I don’t hear you complaining about that, or all the cities burned/looted during the riots from BLM! Hypocrite@HardenzBetta @sirafsirafsiraf @espn @warriors This is why you got suspended@cheznico_ @securityman63 @warriors It’s also pathetic to blame an inanimate object. You put a gun in a safe it’ll stay there. You going to blame the guy who ran over and killed people in Waukecha or the car?@ecramsfan8110 @messismofinito @warriors Guns in the wrong hands kill. The issue is keeping guns out of the wrong hands.@PeterTrapino @McLean_Deluxe @donato501 @unbiasedgswfan @espn @warriors So your plan is to take on the US Government with your AR-15 if it "gets out of control"? Good luck with that.@warriors Steve Kerr, thank you 🙏 https://t.co/8E0LrDP4Nh@warriors This broke my heart.

And getting stab is more survivable than being shot.@warriors Ty @SteveKerr for calling out the legislative inaction contributing to #buffalo, #Uvalde and other mass shootings. It’s just not ok to look away.@DeludedWarriors @baby_face_goat @warriors Yeah I was just meaning that as coming from another teams page. Absolutely need to fix this shit.@espn @warriors Would the background check he is talking about have stopped this shooting?@VernonWells10 @jayce__wells @CWells_10 @warriors Oh man...Big D can't be ok with this.  But I agree, keep your foot on they throats and go home and rest up.@NapoleonIV10 @chung_cr @espn @AdamSchefter @warriors That’s not the point, the point is every time this happens, which is weekly at this point, everyone says prayers and then forgets about and they do nothing, The point is they do nothing and have done nothing to solve this problem. He is not an idiot@warriors 50 senators holding us hostage.@NapoleonIV10 @dexeehart @espn @warriors Bro ive seen you're profile so many times in these comments im pretty sure you saw the news and just said "good, fuck them kids" 🙄@warriors Truth.@bradybuzz @warriors @DubsCommunity If only we had better background checks that kid wouldn't have had that gun lol. No law will EVER prevent a criminal from getting a gun, we need to take the next bag of BILLIONS of dollars that we plan on sending to Ukraine and use it to hire armed security for our schools.@espn @warriors Sick and tired of Steve Kerr’s politics@SpotlessM @warriors Chicago has the strictest gun laws of any City in the US and they have more gun violence than any City in the US...@espn @warriors what is he going to do blame trump again@warriors As a Mavs fan, that’s was disgustingly beautiful to watch!@warriors Regardless of whether the issues are gun control or mental health, he's passionate about change 
Many of us are
Coach Kerr is a huge advocate for mental health as well-- as he was a keynote spkr at a conference my company hosted in 2019
We just want all the change we need.@warriors @RexChapman No they won’t they don’t care they want power and money@warriors Love the Warriors, love coach Kerr as a coach. Gun reform is not the answer, promoting hate towards law enforcement isn’t the answer. ( supporting BLM ) Kerr is as political as the politicians. Let’s stop the hate baiting BS. Create security response plans and train teachers@spencergh2 @espn @warriors Ok pass stricter gun laws …and then when another school shooting happens you can die on that hill and think about “ well we at least did something”@warriors But signing a piece of paper won’t do anything . Bad people will always get what they want.@Tzacher2001 @benjamintennar @ThomDevine @warriors Take those away too.@DavidMoss21 @ecramsfan8110 @messismofinito @warriors Honest question. What do you think criminals will do with the guns they already have?@EinsteinHood @Its_S1mple @espn @AdamSchefter @warriors Cause guns are being sold at middle schools and high schools? Okay you're right. Fuck it all then.@PotatoHeadBiden @LoserBunny69420 @RealNBAExpert @espn @warriors but those people will have given up their guns. I'm sure they'd be 1st in line. LOL@securityman63 @warriors Empowering a bunch of armchair psychiatrists isn't going to solve this.

Reducing the number of guns in our country will.

Check out stats from countries who reduced the number of guns, and get back to us when you have a basic understanding of the situation.@seaside1776 @warriors Australia banned all automatic and semi-automatic weapons in 1996 following the massacre in Port Arthur.

Know how many mass killings there have been since? None.

Laws DO stop mass killings.The Golden state warriors will be rained out tonight #GSWvsDAL https://t.co/xa0VW4z8tvUniversal background checks and an assault weapons ban now!  #GoldenStateWarriors #stevekerr @gop @LeaderMcConnell this is on you. #complicit #gop@Stake @warriors please 🙏🙏🙏 i need ur help. stake- Eduardopatromo@warriors Truly righteous indignation from coach Kerr. He’s absolutely right. We have all had enough, except for those Senators and the corrupt gun lobbyists who have purchased their souls. #GunControlNow@Tzacher2001 @benjamintennar @ThomDevine @warriors We will find out that a pistol was not used in most if not all of the deaths@espn @warriors We need more steve kerrs in this world. So much passion. Maybe we need those professional athletes to help us rise up and do something about this violence. Prayers for all of america.@CammyMacLachlan @Pats_Fan_603 @donato501 @unbiasedgswfan @espn @warriors Exactly. Even this fantastical “well armed militia” would get completely run over by any government military.@AtxPatty @baby_face_goat @warriors All love and peace though, what you said kinda just rubbed me the wrong way I know you meant nothing behind it@NapoleonIV10 @ItBeJota @eternallyboard @espn @warriors Who the hell cares what the founding fathers wanted. They’re dead 300 years ago. Just fuxking change things, right now.@_LordJoseph @benjamintennar @ThomDevine @warriors So you're saying if they had guns they wouldn't have been forced into their homes? Lol you guys and your delusional idea that citizens with guns keeps the government in check is just fucking preposterous. You do realize the government has drones, tanks, helicopters?@warriors @ScottBilleck Amen.@seaside1776 @warriors Making guns more accessible definitely isn’t helping tho. That’s the issue!!@espn @AdamSchefter @warriors What is coach Kerr doing about the homeless rate in his city of San Francisco? This isn’t deflection either - people take sides that fit their narrative but some (like in the video) are given a platform to speak - speak on all the issues and not just when their convenient to now@securityman63 @warriors No, we don’t.@espn @warriors Before The Last Dance aired, we knew Steve’s dad Malcolm was assassinated overseas when Steve was a freshman at Arizona in 84. Kerr knows what it’s like to lose a family member to gun violence. Just in case we get “what does he know?” comments@warriors Amen@NapoleonIV10 @chung_cr @espn @AdamSchefter @warriors seatbelts don’t always save lives but we’re not like “meh oh well, let’s not bother requiring them” are we?? stupid fucking take@warriors thank you, Steve@gbcomment @LebronRaymore @warriors So that's not Lebron James@ThomDevine @warriors Shut up!@GarrottOrion @baby_face_goat @warriors Fair.@MattSchlicher @unbiasedgswfan @espn @warriors If there are no "arms" no one would be able to bare them. Only military personnel should have guns. No one else INCLUDING law enforcement. Stun guns only for them@warriors Ima share this I was in a situation at my high school where we went into a lock down during my homeroom period and people were saying there was a guy with a gun and we were hiding in the back of the gym where the lockers where at for about an hour and then cops with loaded out 1.@unbiasedgswfan @espn @warriors The largest attack on American soil started with a couple box cutters. Unfortunately evil will always find a way😓@ThomDevine @warriors Fact is children aren’t safe in American schools. Fact is 18 children were murdered today. Fact is it’s another school massacre and it’s becoming a part of life in a country that puts guns first.@seaside1776 @Rene_Rugeles @johhnnpp @warriors Who is talking about even banning guns? Once again, it’s about minimizing supply. More supply means more gun violence. 

https://t.co/EWFnLcQd7I@HandsomeJimmy13 @Buscusriot @johhnnpp @seaside1776 @warriors No i am talking about the mass shooting. So how do you explain the aburd uptick of mass shooting since then.@3000Elsinore @securityman63 @warriors So the gun woke up today killed a grandma and 15 people at a school. It’s never the person who pulled the triggers fault let’s just blame an inanimate object rather than the real problem.@ThomDevine @warriors Dude. Really?@RomeroNavy78 @warriors Pay attention to what Ker said, regardless of what they do it’s not gonna chnage things, it’s down to the senators and people in power … post poning games or doing moments of silence whilst it gives respect to the victims ultimately it doesn’t do much.@LOYALHAWKSFANPR @espn @warriors Fuck no, there should be an officer with a gun per every 100 kids in schools@RomeroNavy78 @warriors No. I only say that because he literally made a statement about being tired of moment of silences, etc. Others have to do more. GOVERNMENT@AtxPatty @baby_face_goat @warriors What team you like doesn’t matter cornball@espn @warriors thanks Steve@ThomDevine @warriors Facts? An 18 year old walked in to an elementary school and slaughtered 18 children. You don’t want facts your want excuses.@VaxSports @warriors 💯 exactly. 🙏🏽This is Steve Kerr, the head coach of the Golden State Warriors saying what most of us want to say. https://t.co/Wa4cH20lZr@WantGreatness @warriors If you think you can kill as many people within a period of with a knife as with an AR15 I don’t think you understand how anything works and you need to compare how the US compares to other civilized countries@LebronRaymore @warriors Thought you felt that people who have a platform, like you, should use it when the issue is one of great importance. Kerr knows about the loss of a loved one from murder. Some things are more important than the next playoff game.@HardenzBetta @espn @warriors It was a 18 year old@securityman63 @warriors Yeah like other countries don't have mental issues and yet managed to stay away from mass school shootings. Just go bury your head in the ground. fucks sake.@warriors he's absolutely right and I'm glad he used this moment to do what he could@Navglad @demonpebble @RealNBAExpert @espn @warriors To deal a firearm legally you have to be licensed. A waiting period would do nothing to someone who has ill intent. Passing down of guns has no relevance considering if the person receiving cant legally own one they risk being caught and insurance makes zero sense.@LebronRaymore @warriors Yeah well none of those kids went to school today looking to catch a fucking bullet so I guess nobody wins@warriors @rwesthead All these comments and not one about mental illness.  People are clueless@AtxPatty @baby_face_goat @warriors Like I know I shouldn’t have replied period because it’s kind of unnecessary and there’s a bigger problem here obviously but man, that’s funky as fuck@ThomDevine @warriors Piss yourself. Children are dead@Its_S1mple @espn @AdamSchefter @warriors Sure sounds good. So let's not stop them from obtaining them legally cause they can obtain them illegally. Sounds like a great thing to do@micnificent28 @warriors Do bad guys carry AR’s? Then so should the good guys.@warriors The best leader in sports worldwide- so much admiration for this man.@SHOWen11 @donato501 @unbiasedgswfan @espn @warriors I am not gonna come on twitter and agree or disagree with you I am just to tired today but I will say look at what you just said.

You'd be dead before you could load, if the government really wanted you dead.@espn @Traticaster101 @warriors God bless this man for using his platform to stand up for the rest of us!

https://t.co/3IjF9TCtSW@warriors Thank you to Steve Kerr who is actually using his platform to try to bring about some good.@okboomer_haha @681Legend @unbiasedgswfan @espn @warriors The point is essentially if things are illegal it doesn’t mean people won’t get them and use them. Guns or drugs. Telling me every mass shooting in CA or IL gang activity is with legally obtained guns? More people having an ability to protect themselves saves lives.@f8th4lyf_2 @PidgeyRS @warriors What does that have to do with gun laws in the US?@warriors I applauded you for your bold statement against congress! 👏🏻👏🏻@vernKPIX @KPIXtv @warriors @dallasmavs @SHAQ @NBAonTNT @NBA Well, at least you probably have a much easier time finding apparel that fits!

Nothing at all REAL action is needed not postponing a meaningless game@ThomDevine @warriors IT IS A POLITICAL ISSUE. Democrats want HR-8 passed and background checks broadened for gun sales. Republicans don't. The NRA backs Republican candidates and Republican voters follow the NRA's recommendations. IT'S POLITICAL.@warriors I’m confused. They already do background checks when buying a gun. What’s the bill say?@warriors We should probably get rid of guns. I mean look how good Australia is doing now.

If a grown adult with a knife walks into a school with bad intentions, and there’s nobody around to see it or stop it, 18 is an easy number for them. Taking away guns isn’t the answer.@BIGTOMSWORLD @espn @warriors It stops a lot of them. By your logic we should legalize hard drugs because, "what's the point"... Also, In Texas you can buy a gun secondhand without a background check. I sold an AK a few years back. Asked law enforcement what needed to be done. Nothing required.@warriors Bravo @SteveKerr!!! This Does Need 2 STOP!!! He’s Saying What Most People Are Thinking But Can’t Be Heard. God Bless Those That Have Died Today &amp; In The Past Few Days &amp; Weeks.

This should be very clear by now.@TarasClicks @warriors yes cause that adds so eloquently to the conversation..@seaside1776 @warriors Here in Australia, we have gun laws you have to pass a complete police check. No assault rifle allowed.

Maybe I shouldn’t have said that.@nickbladen10 @unbiasedgswfan @espn @warriors Half the country would go to war over it because they have eyes and can see what happens to countries that give up their right to own a firearm.

Remember the 20 pupils &amp; 6 teachers/staffs in Sandy Hook elementary got kill in 2012.@Rastlet @espn @warriors Dude, don’t respond to me with non sense.

Just for all the noobs here, his dad was gunned down/assassinated when he was younger, so gun violence is a very close subject to him.@warriors Go Steve, GO!@Navglad @demonpebble @RealNBAExpert @espn @warriors They basically already have that. Background checks are required if purchasing a firearm through a licensed dealer. Written and physical tests are required if you want to carry a gun in most states and if you’re reckless you will receive a felony and lose the rights to own a gun.@espn @warriors nice to see china is letting him speak on these issues again@espn @warriors KEEP talking about it. Don't just talk about it while it's fresh, shove it down people's throats. People wanna be so proactive and change the world the first day something like this happens but then that fades after a month. Keep that energy at all times!! **GOES FOR EVERYBODY**@espn @warriors Always resented the warriors and Kerr for their success ig but I will say my respect for Kerr has definitely 📈@MattSchlicher @IsItRazist @unbiasedgswfan @espn @warriors I wonder if the founding fathers would be like “you didn’t change a single thing?”@TobiasSunshine @espn @warriors People tend not to know — #americanuniversity@warriors I’m tired 😪@lonestarj @ecramsfan8110 @warriors Definitely not one of these countries https://t.co/WwED1LRbsD@espn @AdamSchefter @warriors Background checks are great, but criminals do not follow laws. You want to protect it children at schools, then hire armed security. Train and designate teachers to be apart of the security team. You can’t stop evil criminals, but you can deter them and stop them if not deterred.@canesfb @espn @warriors Whataboutism@ThomDevine @warriors For being a special education teacher, this was a pretty retarded comment.

Here's a fucking fact. Children were murdered at school. At SCHOOL.

AGAIN.

AGAIN.

AGAIN.@briankirsh @espn @warriors You can try but only one of those options an overwhelming majority of people from all political backgrounds would support.@jonjonweb85 @unbiasedgswfan @espn @warriors And they will do it to armed citizens as well.@seaside1776 @warriors A universal background check should be the bare MINIMUM. I would like to also advocate for a YEARLY mental health check for every gun owner. Our tax dollars should also be spent on a task force investigating and eliminating illegal gun sales.@espn @warriors I just gained so much respect for Kerr. It’s more than basketball at the end of the day. RIP to all the beautiful souls lost today.@ecramsfan8110 @messismofinito @warriors Because you are (I'm guessing) a responsible gun owner of which there are many but that doesn't mean everyone that can get their hands on a gun will be the same. It's about sensible gun laws, nobody is taking your guns away.@benjamintennar @ThomDevine @warriors We had one in Scotland and change the law….

Oh, @FoxNews says prayer is better than gun laws. OK, how can you enforce prayers?@espn @AdamSchefter @warriors Politicians are generally evil and power hungry people, they don't care about our well-being.

No gun-free zones.  No gun-free major cities.  That's a start.  Solution isn't to take away guns.  Arm those that can quell gun violence before it takes innocent lives.

It’s because the second amendment technically says Americans have the right to have guns. But I really wish America could just ban guns, would solve so many problems@espn @warriors Coach Kerr is right. We, the fans of the @NBA , the league, its players, coaches, and commissioner Adam Silver are sick and tired of seeing gun violence impacting today's society. And I know, more than 50 Senators will pass a bill and put @POTUS signed into law.@espn @warriors Respect we the people have to stand upPlease watch this. Steve Kerr the Golden State Warriors coach is right. #Uvalde https://t.co/PMOzXiLD8Y@seaside1776 @warriors We can't stop them. It's about significantly reducing mass shootings with common sense gun laws to start and limiting access to high velocity rifles. 80% of mass shootings involve a firearm purchased legally and many times it's a high velocity rifle.@espn @AdamSchefter @warriors Crazy to me that people think gun laws will stop mass shootings.  Gunmen are willing to commit murder, you think a gun law is going to stop them?  There are over 300 million guns in circulation and thousands of them move hands daily and illegally. Murderers will always get guns.@JaglRock @espn @warriors Lets worry about our sad country before we try to fix the world.@espn @warriors This is what a real human being looks like, takes notes, emulate, be better…every minute of every day be better@warriors Kerr’s father was a professor who was shot &amp; killed in his office my a radicalized young person.

We’re tired of it!@seaside1776 @warriors If you take away guns, people will use whatever else they can find to commit violence. They’ll use knives or fire. It’s not that simple.

#MFFL@warriors I agree we need to do something but him saying universal background checks need to happen shows his ignorance. You cannot purchase a gun legally from a gun dealer without a background check. If the shooter was 18 he legally cannot purchase a handgun.@aklee51 @CHRISPL79266739 @AndrewMcEwan07 @warriors Or maybe both.@warriors Keep the game.  Maybe it’ll keep some people at home and prevent other crazy people from committing more violence.

Happy people don’t kill. Gun laws are too lax and people are too financially strapped and stressed. Living paycheck to paycheck doesn’t cut it. Government needs to do something. SOMETHING! They do nothing. 🤬@warriors Do your Job! #GSWvsDAL@warriors Steve Kerr could have a career in politics if he wanted it.  He would have my vote.@warriors This hit hard@Buscusriot @seaside1776 @warriors You’re beyond help .

I may need to tune in tonight. Go Warriors! #gunreformnow@warriors That's it, things like this happen then it's always let's have a moment of silence........ then everything is solved.The @warriors, @dallasmavs, @StephenCurry30, @luka7doncic and all their teammates and coaches should not show up tonight. On strike til action happens. When the CEOs of the @nba and @NBAonTNT @warnerbros and all their advertisers start calling D.C., maybe something will change.Almost time @warriors@warriors Respect@warriors I love this passion and I wish everyone had the same. I have two points:
1. He has the platform to do something about it. Cancel the game tonight. Postpone the playoffs until something is done and action is taken. 
2. If you take away guns, psychopaths will just use knives.@RomeroNavy78 @warriors It’s not gonna stop anything lmao@dirkisbeast @LordYoungBoy @2_schafer @warriors His dad was the American president of a college in Beirut@jj_redick @cardyedwards @warriors @KendrickPerkins @Money23Green @NBA @NBCSWarriors @NBATV @StephenCurry30 Gotcha, maybe I’m mixing up your pod with Bill Simmons or Russillo.

Pray for the families, rinse and repeat  lol yankee@GoldenBoys027 @warriors It shows unity, respect and gets eyes and voices into the issue, can help put extra pressure on the powers that be.. but yes enhanced background checks would be a positive 👍@RomeroNavy78 @warriors Why??

That kinda contradicts him@warriors Thank you Coach Kerr for saying what most of us wish we could yell into a microphone and say.Send us plays like this one from the Golden State Warriors, and we'll make you an animated playbook.

I never said anything about him in regards to PHX or DAL@warriors @BaldBryan Why isn't he making a statement before every game about all the children dying because of abortions? More children die that way. Weird.@warriors So happy this is our coach. Great coach and even better person@warriors That’s my coachWatch this. With the sound on. 

People in a position of power and that have the opportunity to sit in front of multiple microphones like this need to keep being passionate and showing their anger and frustrations like this.

It was emotional. It was powerful. Moving.@Nin3rswarri3rs @warriors His father was killed by terrorists so he knows what these families r going through and what he’s talking abt, props to this man@warriors Fully respect the way he goes about everything.

I think it may be a sweep.All pro sports should take a cue from idol groups. When the Golden State Warriors hit the court they should do a choreographed group dance. In fact, any group should do this. Giving me a work presentation?

GS is doing the Spurs 07 Finals make the other teammates beat you instead of the Franchise Player but i dont believe its a sweep but well see.@JeffLebowskiEsq @NBAPlayoffs2022 @warriors @dallasmavs Backs against the wall, sure hard not to lay it on them. Mavs get a meaningless win so GS can close out the series at home? Makes sense.@warriors It's a matter of time for GSW to be champion, it could be in today's game or in game 5, but it will happen soon. The Dallas Maverick don't have enough players to change that score.

That's when the NBA cashes in.Luka Doncic is playing at an all-world level, but can he stop the @warriors? 

The Warriors are -135 to go on and win the NBA Finals - @MeteAktas76 tells us what he thinks: https://t.co/kpCzGEaoyO https://t.co/qKlpLWhIe3@Biglyness @AngelsInTheUK @Angels Non-issue definitely, but California as a whole is less specific, and has some precedent. It's like if the Golden State Warriors renamed to the Oakland Warriors even though they're in SF now.

Warriors have been dominant. Mavs are demoralized. Luka may score 55 but Golden State sweeps tonight.

To make it safe GSW +3.5 parlayed with Mavs TT under: 110

That should be +150 or so#GLGame 4 and a chance for the #Warriors to lock in a date with the NBA Finals. Will Dallas meet “Broomhilda”? @957thegame

Now from 2015-2022 I agree they’ve been dominant.@BUCAntonio @NBAonTNT @dallasmavs @warriors @yoda24man @1967Rich @titletownusa73 Some of the most unnecessarily violent games have been played in these playoffs. The Mavs can’t win on their skills, so they resort to flagrant fouls instead. Kind of sad.

The Warriors have all the motivation to close Dallas out.
They see how banged up Boston and Miami are getting in that series and GSW will have a chance to rest for over a week if they win tonight.

- @celtics aren't necessarily better than @MiamiHEAT. Their players are just more consistent.
- The @warriors had a slump mid-season but from the start to the end they've shown they're the best team in the league and have the greatest dynasty since MJ@warriors Sweep@warriors Greatest shooter ever🤩- AC Milan champions of Italy ☑️

Golden State had Mychal Mulder. PlsGolden State is one win away from heading  to the NBA Finals. They went into Dallas and beat the Mavericks despite Luka Doncic leading all scorers with 40 points in Game 3. Will they win tonight ?

“I think the Wiggins trade is the key to all of this,” Kerr said of Golden State’s success. “I’ve said it many times probably, but we lost so many wing defenders after the [2018-19] season.

It was Wiggins’ chi, his aura, smacking Doncic invisibly.

It’s all depends on which team is a better story. Only way teams can truly win without refs influencing the game is shooting 3-pts.

As we revel in playoff joy once again, we owe every moment to Mieuli (RIP), the most relatable owner in Bay Area history.

Steph has quite literally been the sole and immense reason the Golden State Warriors became a dynasty and are still a dynasty. Something Luka will never get to. LMAOO@JohnAnt95707168 @NBAonTNT @dallasmavs @warriors That happens in every sport but really it’s 4 games man, that makes no sense, meaning the other team never adjusted or were just over rated … teams 💯 do collapse as well#Memphis #Grizzlies: much respect, @warriors....

 #beutee #beuteenet https://t.co/OYgHp7bmRx@QUIS4L @ColinCowherd @warriors An still shooting better than anybody else in the playoffs so your point is what@MavsFilmRoom @dallasmavs getting swept by the @warriors after mutilating the #1 seed on the road in game 7 seems like a badge of honor. Its Golden State. There isn't a single rational person that would consider this season a failure for the franchise.Crazy thing about tonight’s game is that the @warriors could beat @dallasmavs with just Curry, Poole, Thompson, Wiggins, and Looney. They don’t even need Green tonight and still win by 11 or more.@itstylersays @AyoJocko There is no doubt about it, both in terms of experience and strength. Bostonians and Golden State Warriors are not on the same level and I believe Steph will get his first Finals MVP@DonZionda @balldontstop @warriors Unfortunately, Steph isn't throwing himself to the ground and rolling around or yelling and throwing his head back, so no foul, according to the refs@ScottStrazzante @BoredApeYC @StephenCurry30 @warriors @sfchronicle Legend🔥@warriors wild. Sweeping 'em up.  Sweep #Boston too!@Iknowsports3k @ColinCowherd @warriors Last response, for the playoffs, which is the point I made, Curry, Klay &amp; Poole are all around 39% via ESPN, not 50.  Maybe 50 for this series, or team overall but my point was they (true shooters) are not shooting as well for playoffs or the season as they have in the past.👋Golden State Warriors https://t.co/EKQrGi8r5q@NBA @dallasmavs @warriors Offensive Foul! Right arm push off into the upper mid section of the defender that had established position... but its luka so not gonna call it. 

Rare calls at end of quarters but this would not have been called on him anywhere on the court at anytime during a game.

To view this bet or copy it https://t.co/mVhJ6IpyZ0 https://t.co/FVmfNaofHf@ButlerBurnerAcc @2ndSon_001 @warriors Butler is doing a very good playoffs, but also Curry and Luka. Butler's injury might cause problems to Miami Heat. I think Curry is a different player except for Luka and Irving.  Butler is more a foward isnt? Between those 3 I personally prefer Curry. Luka is still young though.@warriors i need to print this in 4k and place it in my roomAndrianjafitrimo, Tessah - Pliskova, Karolina

Dallas Mavericks vs  Golden State Warriors

Join TG for more updates  https://t.co/lWz949LsCG https://t.co/S9mrREA5O7@RealSkipBayless @undisputed He's doing the best he can... I guess Luka could go for 60 every game but how sustainable is that. Luka is literally playing against the Golden State Warrior Allstar Team and they keep playing zone defense because they're so scared of him.
 https://t.co/SjOMPjqBkL@warriors Let’s bring the brooms everybodyWhat will be the end result of #Warriors #Mavs #NBAPlayoff series?

Golden State leads 3-0. No #NBA team has ever come back from a 3-0 deficit to win best-of-7 series.

Not sure that’s his style. Now Jamal Murray on the other hand…Let's hope we don't do what we did in the @Bucks  series. Let's win Game 5, and then Game 6. Please do not drag this out until Game 7. This time we don't have home court, and the @warriors  will be too fresh for us even if we win Game 7. Let's do this @celtics🍀. 6 more wins.Golden State Lighstkin Warriors 😂❤️ https://t.co/N6WwBUHeMvnew message  @warriors https://t.co/ECuoeMTAckNBA fans and media comparing Luka Doncic to Larry Bird is ridiculous. Luka is superstar, no doubts there but this take that he “cannot” beat the Golden State Warriors with this current Mavs squad is utter nonsense. Especially down 3-0.@fasteddiegloor @StephenCurry30 @warriors @nuggets 😅 Jokic should get an ape soonNobody says anything about the Warriors being on a fast break and mfs go straight to the 3 point line! Why? Cuz mfs know that’s who Golden State is and u can do that when u have Stephen Curry 😮‍💨@coolninja831 @ArmchairTyrant @NBAMuse24 @WarriorsMuse @realchriswebber @WigginsMuse @Money23Green @Draymond23Muse @GinaReppinDaBay @GoIdenState @antonin_org @CurryMuse @warriors Fr bro it’s pretty interesting to me Idk why people are so pissed 😂⁦@StephenCurry30⁩ says this is best stretch of basketball by current version of Golden State Warriors -  And I fully agree.

#NBAPlayoffs@DogSurfRoadshow @StephenCurry30 @warriors Agreed. To me, this is the best version of the Warriors during this decade.

Embarrassing one sided reffing.@Pickswise @warriors Replies saying foul are patheticThe conference finals are so baddddd. Congrats @warriors on another ring. It's happening.Van Gundy already doubting the Warriors and saying the Celtics are a better all around team is a weird move considering they are DOWN in their series. How can you put any team over Golden State right now? Has he watched them play in the postseason at all? #NBAPlayoffs@warriors Y’all better win tomorrow 🗣🗣‼️@ozantok19 @warriors @22wiggins No one understands what you mean since you can’t put together a cohesive English sentence.It’s probably just me, but as good as the Golden State Warriors are, they are so full of themselves. No humble pie, all bravado. I love great teams (and they are) who don’t cheerlead during the game. #NBAPlayoffsUnique sporting situation for me tomorrow. I have 2 teams playing, &amp; if they win, they go through to the finals but if they lose, they get another chance:

I dont believe either are offensively consistent enough to beat @warriors in 7 game series #DubNation #,NBAA ton of basketball folks are talking about Andrew Wiggins and how his trade to the Warriors changed his career, but as a recent Timberwolves fan, I’m also curious about D. Lo. I feel like it’s damning that Golden State traded him when he could have been imagined in Poole’s role.@jbondwagon @StephenCurry30 @warriors Does he hangout on BAYC discord tho?ion gaf what nobody say @warriors didn’t play no good teams this year in da playoffs@KDTrey5 wishes right now he didn’t let his ego take him out of @warriorsThe NBA Conference Finals are in full swing.

#GoldenState will annihilate the Bostonians
And that'll be perfect IMO
I'd HATE IT if Boston wins
I'm still hoping #MiamiHeat have some tricks up their sleeves
Celtics look good
But Warriors are experienced
They're built to win@gbrafal @transbay @SFBART @warriors @sfmta_muni @ChaseCenter I've already done it for myself. I don't feel like doing it for you. YOU do it if you're truly open-minded and honest, otherwise I'll conclude that you're neither and move along.@crackedhostile @Yruonhere @NBAMuse24 @Dame_Lillard @trailblazers @warriors @blazersforreal @BlazersArgento @LillardOwnsYou @DameStaying @KindredSwerv @Dame_Time1023 @kimmyann1111 Sefalosha is better than your favorite player😤@gbrafal @transbay @SFBART @warriors @sfmta_muni @ChaseCenter You're wrong. An open-minded, honest person would've sought dissenting studies on their own. Instead, you've referenced the sole study that supports your claim. Peak intellectual dishonesty. I'm not going to do this work for you - I've already done it &amp; have no obligation.@QUIS4L @Cuck__Norris @ColinCowherd @warriors Oh...because YOU never believed in Memphis 🤣Daily reminder that *Golden state warriors* did this to b2b MVP &amp; MIP this postseason.

His game remind me so much of Nick Van Exel in many ways but he snakey like ginobli on some of those twisting layups.  The league is in good hands indeed. Can't wait to see the rest play out.

I’ve repeatedly invited you to share the “proof” that supports your contentions. Hardly the m.o. of a “closed minded” or “dishonest”character. You’ve responded with derision ane insults, but not with any evidence. 

Who is really “closed minded” here?@Yruonhere @NBAMuse24 @Dame_Lillard @trailblazers @warriors @blazersforreal @BlazersArgento @LillardOwnsYou @DameStaying @KindredSwerv @Dame_Time1023 @kimmyann1111 A decent portion of most superstar’s games aren’t gonna be good relative to their stats, that’s how averages work

Even someone like LeBron (who I consider the goat) has had more playoff games shooting below 40% from the field than playoff games shooting above 60% from the fieldCeltics and Heat having a whole MID OFF game to game in these ECF just to figure out who gets smashed to SMITHEREENS in the Finals by the Warriors 😂😂 them Golden State boys bout to be looking like: https://t.co/jWtoMkmePU@Spinandwin007 @VoiceInYourHea5 @SamsonChung5 @HaterMuse @NBAMuse24 The same KD that got swept 4-0 and blew a 3-1 lead to the warriors?

The one time they won without KD was when Labron was was without both Kevin Love and Kyrie. KD never would had signed with golden state if he would have known how he would be treated by the team and organization.#videogames #crypto #basketball quite a movie poster right there!

For a team to rebuild that fast and reach another Finals in the amount of time the Warriors have is unheard of! Curry, Thompson and Greene are H.O.F. players!Fewest points scored in the 1st Quarter in Franchise History. Heat gotta get pissed off and adjust. Screw bounce backs. It's win now. Warriors are about to sweep the Mavs. Neither of these teams wants a seven game series.

https://t.co/zlsE7iC4Ge@_mcflyboi_ @SeaBusChan19 @BeKindGoodVibes @warriors Luka only has Brunson &amp; Spencer and (don't get me wrong, they're great players) but I can't see the Mavs coming back from a series without someone crazy good, that's just right under Luka. It's warriors in 5/6 tbh. If it goes to game 7 somehow, Curry's not going out like that tbh@mikless94 @Jacob54875305 @MattParodyAcc @warriors Grizzlies went 20-5 without Morant in the regular season and you’re really trying to say they ain’t better without him?!

That was one play on Payton Jr., Draymond had one play &amp; that was it.  Thanks for reinforcing my point.@jean_kerwyn @SeaBusChan19 @BeKindGoodVibes @warriors Yes he doesn't have the what you call Kyrie tier help in one player but as he has many players that make up for it. Also Luka is a mini young LeBron, but anything is possible and not impossible so the series isn't over until it is.Congrats in advance to the @warriors for winning this years NBA Championship https://t.co/QwmpNnxSxSCongrats @warriors@Yelaboi103 @MiamiHEAT @celtics @warriors Hey Gooden state looking good no doubt.

On April 6, 1997, Dallas scored only two points. Golden State accomplished the two-point quarter on Feb. 8, 2004.@Satyaeger @EliOtt78032347 @morky23 @warriors That was earlier like right before it when he hit him on top after. As you see from my clips that's the reason why he fell aside.

Also their shooting is not what it usually is/was so it would go 6-7 whether Celtics or Heat.In last night's @warriors win, @StephenCurry30 moved into 64th on the All-Time #NBAPlayoffs defensive rebounds list, passing @KendrickPerkins with 575 for his career.
