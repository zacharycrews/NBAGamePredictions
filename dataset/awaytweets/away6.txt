Have the Orlando magic pregame?@cavs @firstenergycorp @MarkkanenLauri @CollinSexton02 @dariusgarland22 @evanmobley @_bigjayy_ In my opinion, Okoro needs to start above Sexton and Sexton needs to be 6th man. He would literally be the 6th man of the year. Perfect role for him. 

Regardless, go Cavs 💪🏻SOMEBODY FIX THIS???????

You can’t watch the PL, Bundesliga, Serie A, La Liga and Ligue 1 all at the same time for example. Many fans don’t watch any as they tune into other lower leagues (1/2)#NBA, #Basketball,

Morant is amazing and I believe Grizzlies win the game, but this is too many points. Cleveland defense should be able to keep this one tight. Cavs have a good track record ATS vs Memphis.Let’s go @cavs baby!!!
