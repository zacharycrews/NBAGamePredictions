Thoughts: 

-I think no matter what the end of season goal for this team is from a front office perspective, they’ll be most successful by giving Jalen Brunson the keys. Even if it means taking the ball out of RJ’s hands. 

(It doesn’t.)I love @nyknicks opening night! Usually comes crashing down a few weeks in but right now ONLY GOOD VIBEZ #NewYorkForever@stephenasmith @nyknicks We don’t want you there you racist fake fanI completely get it’s still full swing @Yankees season…

But… Need to put on wax some @nyknicks goals, (realistic, and a stretch) since Im so hyped for their season opening too. So here goes…

- 45 Wins 

- 2 of the 3 (RJ/Randle/Brunson) All Stars)

- Playoff Berth 

Thoughts?@stephenasmith @nyknicks No clue how anyone will sleep tonight…oh yes I do…with their eyes closed-Bosnia and Herzegovina: Jusuf Nurkic (Portland Trail Blazers)

Stephen A is one important presence because he is part of the media. He is a fan and probably the most important name on the biggest sports network on USA.

One of the most encouraging things about the preseason was how much faster New York was playing. Now they start the season against one of the best up-tempo teams in the league. Good test@stephenasmith @nyknicks Nicks are STR8 TRASH from top to bottom. Punchline of NY sports...@atlhoe12345 @Mets @nyknicks Precisely.

This is also a clear indication that the Grizzlies are slick tanking. Look for a lot of "load management" for Ja.MVP - Giannis Antetokounmpo, Milwaukee Bucks
