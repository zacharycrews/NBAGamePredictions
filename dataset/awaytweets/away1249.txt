No 1 (Outside Phoenix or New Orleans) wants to see the Suns and Pelicans https://t.co/0CuYOJMplz🏀NEW ORLEANS PELICANS OVER 106 TT🏀. New Orleans averaged 107.6 pts per game in their L5. Phoenix Suns are allowing a average of 108.6 pts in their L5 to opponents. This number is really tight, but I think we can get there tonight in a game 2 situation. BOL🍀#GamblingTwitter https://t.co/UEkGMFdbhiThe Pelicans have covered the spread in six of their last ten road games and have won six of those games outright. New Orleans hasn't lost two straight on the road since early March.

Anyone like an upset tonight?
