The Bulls on the road against an opponent who is off 2 consecutive games in which they scored 108 or more points is 16-0 to the UNDER since 2019.

Bulls look to slow them down.

Sixers have been playing well also.I see Ole comparing us to the Chicago Bulls when it comes to the comparison of Cristiano Ronaldo being our Michael Jordan. 

‚Ä¶

Chicago Bulls had the greatest coach in the history of basketball at the helm &amp; Michael Jordan wasn‚Äôt bailing out rancid performances every week.
