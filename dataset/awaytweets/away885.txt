The Atlanta Hawks made a roster move over the All-Star break, adding Georgia’s Corey Knapp as a Social Media Coordinator on a full-time deal.

He’ll be in uniform tonight for their first game back. Hawks sit at 10th in the East, for now 😉

#NBA #NBATwitter #dataanalyst #investingtips@uandme4life @ATLHawks I love Gallo, he is old and you have to pace him to get him to last this season. I would be fine starting him, but he can't do 25+ minutes EVERY game. Hate to say it, but he was injury prone before he got here.@Maelo_DzT @HawksTalonGC @ATLHawks Safe travels Maelo!💪🏽@VonBoxChevy @ATLHawks I don’t get the playing Gallo so many minutes things. It’s not like he brings that much to the table. Often times he tries to do too much. I hate when he looks Trae off, brings the ball up to go one on one on offense@atlmillennials @ATLHawks Thanks for thinking of us! Getting outside and doing good is always a "things to do" list topper! 🌳🌳🌳 #moretreesplease #dogood #cityintheforest@uandme4life @ATLHawks Please give JJ some run!After a couple months of zoom calls and remote work, I'm finally omw to Atlanta!

Trae had 10,9 Ast last 2 games against the Bulls.

There’s no scenario where the @ATLHawks move on from @TheTraeYoung. This is a troll job.@jcallins @chauncygamer @ChrisKirschner @ATLHawks Thank you for clarifying. You bring up valid concerns, but if Zion is available expect Schlenk to make a run at him and figure it the rest on subsequent deals.@theScore @NickFriedell @ATLHawks Like giving a deaf man an mp3 player@evil_dallas @chauncygamer @ChrisKirschner The @ATLHawks need improved defense from any personnel moved.  Zion's health is questionable, and is mostly upside offensively.@SportsTalkATL Zion Williamson will be traded to the Atlanta Hawks in the offseason. Now if it works out and Zion stays healthy...who knows.@femaleatlhawk Yes we all saw him put his hands on our logo on the draft board @ATLHawks 🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾@YuriyATL @ATLHawks Gone be my 1st time in Houston.

I be damn if Travis should bet the farm on a one year pipe dream. Trae and Zion would be awesome but has to be extension in the works https://t.co/fSHapwfnDt@GoatedJ0n @ATLHawks I’d like that too, I also kinda think they might try to fill that role with an established player in free agency or through a trade@atlhawkstime11 @ATLHawks They would become the Atlanta Towers 😳 he’s also 7-1, 245 pounds@KevinKeneely1 @ATLHawks 7 blocks per 40 and 10 blocks per 100 possessions 😮😮😮

That’s unreal lol. If he can become a good outside shooter, I wanna see him and O on the court together at times as well@atlhawkstime11 @ATLHawks He’s ridiculous on defense 😳 look at his per40 and per100 blocks https://t.co/FA0StSfjBK@KevinKeneely1 @ATLHawks We need either a scoring guard like a Tyty or a player like Ochai Agbaji. Guys who are gonna play their roles@KevinKeneely1 @ATLHawks Jeez, he’s a menace on defense. If he can improve that outside shot, I’d love him on the hawks@FIizop @KevinKeneely1 @ATLHawks Hmm. Then it depends on where we pick. I still wouldn’t mind taking him if we pick in the early-mid 20s. 

I’d really like AJ Griffin though@GoatedJ0n @ATLHawks I’m not sure the Hawks really have a position where they need to draft a starter, unless we are worried about Hunter and Huerter for the future@atlhawkstime11 @ATLHawks Ehhh I think he’s going to be a first round pick based on his defense alone and the fact that he does already have a 3-point shot (he’s just got to improve it a lot). But he does average 1.5 3PA on 22% shooting at the moment.

130.2 ORtg
82.0 DRtg@KevinKeneely1 @ATLHawks woulnt be that  intrested in drafting a backup big@KevinKeneely1 @ATLHawks Is kessler someone who the hawks can get in the second round? I know who he is but I don’t know much about what range he will get drafted in 

If we could snag him in round 2 then I totally agree with you@ATLHawks @emoryhealthcare Get well soon guys!!@atlhawkstime11 @ATLHawks I agree 💯 I’m saying to bring him in as OO’s backup. OO won’t be able to play all game so if they were to trade Capela in the offseason they could bring Kessler in to replace Capela and become OO’s backup@KevinKeneely1 @ATLHawks If he could shoot, maybe. But we already got O at center. I feel like moving forward he’s earned the right to be the only center of the future for Atlanta@LoganHinton @SagED_UP Truth!  I would watch the @ATLHawks every night but I can’t thanks to @BallySportsSO and @YouTubeTV. 🤦‍♂️Walker Kessler’s halftime stats against Ole Miss, in just 15 minutes ⬇️
