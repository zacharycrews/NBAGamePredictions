@BurnerClarkson@grizzfan1993 @AndrewFGrizz @Nateg8888 @GrizzliesPR @memgrizz @Pacers That's how every basketball roster is constructed. Every great point guard in history has had a backup, because it's good for the starting point guard to have one.

Not to mention how much Ja supports Tyus...@idcstfumaynee @JokuTrey @warriors @mjtreyfivekay @HesiJulian @MasterKert_ @memgrizz @BallsackSports @RingzSeason22 @TheGoatWiseman @The30John @MapuGRU @haileyaleah2 @WashedLouis @swift_payola13 @CurryIsMyDaddy @hotdog317 @miguelatthetop @washedtraruso W wholesome nba fan@MapuGRU @JokuTrey @MVPhoenixSZN @warriors @mjtreyfivekay @HesiJulian @MasterKert_ @memgrizz @BallsackSports @RingzSeason22 @TheGoatWiseman @The30John @haileyaleah2 @WashedLouis @swift_payola13 @CurryIsMyDaddy @hotdog317 @miguelatthetop @washedtraruso Finished my test early.

We set a new record for biggest NBA victory without him. The Grizz are good enough to beat a bottom-dwelling Pacers team without him.

You're the one who brought up him leaving in the off-season and completely forgot the original tweet's context.@ILove_theArts @GrizzliesPR @memgrizz @Pacers They don't need him to beat the Pacers, much like Pop didn't need his Big Three to beat the Miami Heat in the 2014 regular season, before they won their ring!@ChanleyCourtTV @memgrizz @CourtTV Chanley's walking in Memphis...🎶🎶 Will you be providing coverage on Saturday and Sunday if court is in session?@grizzfan1993 @Nateg8888 @GrizzliesPR @memgrizz @Pacers When you care more about being right than your team winning. https://t.co/yWjBhr7BcI@ChanleyCourtTV @memgrizz @CourtTV Openings tomorrow ?@ChanleyCourtTV @memgrizz @CourtTV Definitely watchingTUNE IN: A jury has been seated in TN v #BillyRayTurner charged with the murder of @memgrizz NBA Star #LorenzenWright in 2010…one of the most highly publicized cases in #Memphis history
