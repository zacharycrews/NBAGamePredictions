The Miami Heat are missing a lot defensively right now without Bam Adebayo and Jimmy Butler.

He did a lot of stuff... but in some ways, it was what he *didn't* do that was a testament to his brilliance as a defender.

There you go.@104JEG0783 @jrichardgoodman Oh I didn't mean Victor is as good of a player as Klay. Oladipo would need to be compared to the players on the heat's skeleton roster, and he's better than most. Miami's solid rn, but they'd be scary when healthy.Ey @MiamiHEAT has the Illuminati got Morris bro 🤷‍♂️🙏…we coming up to 30 games@Abarmier @dylonthedude @1DCSportsFan @WashingtonNFL @Vistaprint NHL has a team named Avalanche and a team named Wild. NBA has the Utah Jazz and Miami Heat. A team name doesn't have to be plural. The problem is that that name will just bring more of the same objections that got us to this ridiculous point in the first place.5 topics I can talk about for 30 minutes without any preparation:

1. The Office 
2. 2016 election in Wyoming (local, state and Pres) including bizarre caucus system 
3. Miami Dolphins football 
4. Miami Heat basketball 
5. Frustration over not putting away shopping carts https://t.co/fjNqrKC4jLIn this playoff scenario the Bulls can play the Heat in the 2nd round and I don’t see them beating Miami if Miami is healthy 

#BullsNation #HEATCulture https://t.co/NbSG9wwkhaJames does have a pair of single-digit playoff games — in 2011 and 2014 when he was on the Miami Heat. https://t.co/WmmPYraJaZ@TTVItsSmoak @LenoThough @__Havok___ @insiddes_1345 @NotARoleModeI @ZachLaVine Never mind u a miami heat fan even worse my bad u should have agreed lmfaoWhen Russ Said Next Man Up Mentality 😂😂😂😅 You Took That From #MiamiHeat@naveenganglani @MiamiHEAT @hothothoops @SBNationNBA Oh hell yeah!Is there a cloud starting to form above this squad, one that inspires the sentiment of “what could be” will always be “what could have been?”

Or is that just the temporary frustrations chiming in?

Words on the @MiamiHEAT for @hothothoops/@SBNationNBA

I really like Michael Mann movie's anyways. Heat is phenomenal (magua is in it), public enemies, collateral, Miami vice (movie-tv series), thief, manhunter.

Eddie Jones is at the bottom of the top 10 because of his short stint with the franchise. In his four years with the Miami Heat, Jones was spectacular averaging over 15 points per game and shooting above 39% from three #MiamiHeat https://t.co/EQnQsh1uTNDang it

Jamal Mashburn was a key contributor for the late 90s Tim Hardaway and Alonzo Mourning squads. Often the third man on these teams, Mashburn played his role very well, carving a niche as a great two-way scorer. #MiamiHeat https://t.co/bQGgI2SsK7@GioDempsey @MiamiHEAT @SRochesterNBA I hear he skipped the lunch line and they found extra chicken patties in his pocketsCheck this out!

I mean the heat had a run the dolphins were good in the 90s but the hurricanes are in the forefront of Miami lure. 5 time national champions and more to come.
