https://t.co/o75oZ8vnE8@k_msft @_lcg_2 Whatchu mean? THT is a very talented young player. He's an elite slasher who plays well in transition and can play defense. A young team like @trailblazers would be very fortunate to receive a player like THT in exchange for an older point guard they have on their roster. 💯@trailblazers @MichelobULTRA @bruceely From playoff contenders to this.  But everybody got that CJ trade they all have been begging for for years.🙄I’m a little livid.  All of this has been ridiculous and it really is the laughing stock of the league right now.@trailblazers @MichelobULTRA @bruceely That some serious style! 😎The Portland Trail Blazers are 19.5-point (!) road underdogs tonight against the Dallas Mavericks.

Portland is 1-8 ATS (0-9 SU) in its last nine games@dallasmavs @trailblazers @BallySportsSW @theeagledallas Let's Go Mavs! #MFFL@bballbreakdown @trailblazers @2ez_nassie Great stuff, as usual. I really like the going off of two feet, especially in the paint.@inquisitor4187 @RyanCerrritos @LakeShowYo @trailblazers Dame is like a decade older, that would be a terrible trade for the Lakers. Old guys don’t win, Blazer would be smart to move off Dame while he has value and can get younger, bigger guard who can defend and put up 40 points in a gameDetroit Pistons - Milwaukee Bucks
Brooklyn Nets - Cleveland Cavaliers
Toronto Raptors - Houston Rockets

https://t.co/RFAYArDmri@trailblazers How bout no@RyanCerrritos @LakeShowYo @trailblazers It was funny until you called Dame washed. As a great man once said, Keep my starting pgs name out your f**king mouth!Big #NBA night for a couple of former #WSU hoopsters:
— @warriors' Klay Thompson: 33 pts, 6-of-10 from 3 in a win against the depleted #Lakers.
— @trailblazers' CJ Elleby: Career-high 17 pts on 7-of-11 shooting in a loss to the #Pelicans.@trailblazers GIVE US DAMIAN AND YOU GET THT PLUS MORE. ITS A FAIR DEAL https://t.co/R7lpRdxboN@LakeShowYo If this trade happens it will easily goes down as the most even trade in NBA history. Once Jusuf is healthy he and THT will run the league. Dame is an aging rap artist. THT is the future. Portland couldn’t afford to say no to this. @trailblazers pull the trigger!2 more, just 2 more meaningless games and this horrific @trailblazers season can be in the rear view mirror.  Then it’s time to hope for the Pelicans getting knocked out of the playoffs and onto the draft. #RipCity@trailblazers @EllebyCj Tank Commander going off 💪Portland Trail Blazers vs New Orleans Pelicans Full Game Replay 2022 Apr 7 NBA Replay HD
