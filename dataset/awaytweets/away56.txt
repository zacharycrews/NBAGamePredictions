He was learning from Reshad Jones techniques. The kid works@hatingkimani24 @MiamiHEAT For you, the real victory is just sleeping with Kemba.

And to think he's a BACKUP center@Splover2090 @statmuse @memgrizz @chicagobulls @DeMar_DeRozan @MiamiHEAT @raf_tyler @MELOD1P Why don't they call him that anymore tho I rarely hear the Celtics announcers say it now that he plays@MiamiHEAT @Klow7 Actually that's OUR (Raptors) point guard...but we'll let you borrow him for a few years!! 😉@SRochesterNBA @KDTrey5 @JHarden13 @MiamiHEAT Yep the 2012 Finals 🏀🔥@Splover2090 @statmuse @memgrizz @chicagobulls @DeMar_DeRozan @MiamiHEAT @raf_tyler @MELOD1P How do you oversleep on your first day?Check out the latest episode of @FiveOnTheFloor5 on the #MiamiHeat and #NBA https://t.co/iyqqcazKTk on #PodbeanThe HEAT went a perfect 19-of-19 from the foul line vs. ORL, marking just the 3rd game in team history in which Miami was perfect from the charity stripe with at least 19 attempts per HEAT game notes @5OTF_@BrooklynNets @MiamiHEAT get ready to get owned by bam again@WonderWoman_AB @MushKat This is nice too. Don't get me wrong about summer, but I grew up in Miami and I've had my fill of year round heat, or heat for that matter. 😄The @MiamiHEAT defense is holding opponents to just 95.7 points per game, the second-lowest average in the NBA per HEAT game notes @5OTF_I honestly can’t believe y’all still won’t follow me back @MiamiHEAT what more does a man have to do#Miami #Heat: The Jimmy ...

Get at it. 👊🏼💥@XTJonJon I’m going Knicks for now. Randle is off to a good start. But I think as the season progresses Miami could be it. Once they get comfortable playing with each other. The heat are also very deep.@SRochesterNBA @KDTrey5 @JHarden13 @MiamiHEAT We gotta find a way to make a pt 2 of that pic tomorrow 😎@5ReasonsSports Meanwhile the @MiamiHEAT https://t.co/aNAqxv6jHA@TheFrankIsola @SiriusXMNBA @Scalabrine I just opened my window here in Brooklyn and I didn’t  smell garbage. It smells different tonight and I realized the Miami Heat and @ByTimReynolds are in town and I was breathing in some of that Heat Culture it even changes the air!@Wadesburner @KCEgamer @MiamiHEAT @Klow7 He doesn’t need to score. You guys need a true PG &amp; that’s Kyle. He’s making all that talent better &amp; Jimmy deserves it 🥲👌🏾Last time I saw @KDTrey5 &amp; @JHarden13 play together in person was 2012. @MiamiHEAT won that one too - see you tomorrow at Barclays! 😂 https://t.co/lWqMk08tR8@DJMeti_GAMING @MiamiHEAT @Klow7 KLow has been a menace for years up here 🇨🇦🙏🏽 take care of him.

Are the heat going to beat Durant and the Nets PLUS Giannis and the Bucks? #doubtful #whois (and if the Heat had a real shot, I’d be upset!)@SportsVibes305 @MiamiHEAT @BrooklynNets @SRochesterNBA #heatnation LETS GO!!! 🔥🔥🔥🏀🏀🏀💯💯💯You have done Tua so dirty @MiamiHEAT@YoungSimba323 Nothing, i know bout the Miami Heat thoThe Miami Heat is sending one of its two-way contract players to the G League. The Heat assigned guard Marcus Garrett to its developmental affiliate, the Sioux Falls Skyforce, as part of his two-way deal Tuesday. https://t.co/Hhx6haUh65@statmuse @memgrizz @chicagobulls @DeMar_DeRozan @MiamiHEAT @raf_tyler @MELOD1P we like that time lord https://t.co/WpTi25gJil@SportsVibes305 @MiamiHEAT @BrooklynNets @SRochesterNBA Travel safe and a have ball 🏀 ‼️‼️ Gonna be a fun game.@MiamiHEAT @BrooklynNets They really offered up some hot sauce in exchange for some cigars... https://t.co/XgXotcP5Yr@Stevenoreo_ Scat pack, Hellcat, license plate with the old Miami heat symbol, and the buccaneers license plate too 🤣@MiamiHEAT @BrooklynNets Me and @SRochesterNBA are making the trip and will be in attendance representing our Miami Heat tomorrow  🔥@raf_tyler Today is the day mate, I’m hoping for a miracle 9th birthday message for the young man.

Here’s a vid of Herro jr practising his snatch crossover today with his off-hand 🏀 @TonyHEAT3xWC @MiamiHEAT https://t.co/2UAIHyICTU$METX Ok guys and gals.

Guess who we are missing?  @MrZackMorris when you gonna bring that heat!!!!@HeatvsHaters @MiamiHEAT Get your minds right...this is a serious task ahead.  #HeatCultureI'm a fan of everything the Miami Heat do....

Welcome to the Heat family@BrooklynNets @MiamiHEAT Eric Adams a whole ass joke.@SeanSpe16901878 @BamForTheSlam @RejectedByBam @nitroceII @MiamiHEAT Don’t care nigga still want him tradedTaj Gibson is to Thibs what Udonis Haslem is to the Miami Heat@SeanSpe16901878 @amirnotshit @RejectedByBam @nitroceII @MiamiHEAT LMFAOOOO😭😭😭💀Between the news of Coach Q &amp; Deshaun Watson, I have two serious questions:

1. How did South Florida sports get so cursed?
2. How did the Miami Heat break said curse?@CJTOCHINA @SeanSpe16901878 @amirnotshit @BamForTheSlam @RejectedByBam @MiamiHEAT LMAOOBecause he held down Miami heat daaays before Bron https://t.co/Xljiwu98KN@Kil889 Oh. The article was abt potential buyout. 
If HOU really means that, and not just flexing, there’s no way he’s coming to Miami. I’ve been a Heat fan since ‘96 and I’ve never seen Riley make a dumb trade. Trading for a player w that age, contract and injury history would be dumb.@NBABrasil @MiamiHEAT @femedeirostt @Budweiser_Br Butler 💛Don Johnson's Sonny Crocket was definitely a Braves Country guy. Colin Farrell's Sonny Crocket seemed more like a Miami Heat fan..@MiamiHEAT SPREAD THE AGENDA ALREADY GOT DAMN https://t.co/1SlQAAXdtp#MIAvsBKN

Tomorrow’s Matchup. #HEATLive

@MiamiHEAT @BrooklynNets

#LEGENDoftheMiamiHEAT #NBA75 https://t.co/il4DARAslK@ckparrot Thank god for the Miami Heat…@FTX_Official @TomBrady @giseleofficial @StephenCurry30 @Trevorlawrencee @MLB @kevinolearytv @LCSOfficial @MiamiHEAT @riotgames @TSM Done it@MiamiHEAT @raf_tyler If he had a team built around his style and pace like Trae or Luka, the kid would be a superstar. It cracks me up those guys are considered great when they have everything built around them. Yet Tyler despite showing he is an offensive genius, lets not say a perennial all star??
