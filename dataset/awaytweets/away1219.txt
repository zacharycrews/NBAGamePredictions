@DepressedRedsox @celtics Let’s hope your are correctOk.. now the real question is. Do the Boston Celtics play to win?@ParlonsNBA Boston Celtics ☘️☘️☘️Bro @celtics this is the only time I’m ok with you losing a gameBoston Celtics will be having a hard time during 1st round of the playoffs. With bucks ducking the Nets, they will either face (win then goes 2nd) Brooklyn Nets or (lose then goes 4th) Toronto Raptors. Pick your own poison@2ktrell U do know it’s for home court advantage in the playoffs they (Boston Celtics) had the same record@AlexisIsKavkas @celtics Yes but it’s Detroit 💀@connor81563303 @celtics Why because I want a smarter route? 

With Rob we are fantastic, so why not survive till then?@BpRichh @celtics We play the bulls first round 💀💀@Jeff95993574 @celtics Only way we play the nets is if the 6ers lose and we win. If we both win then we play the bulls first round. If we both lose then the 76ers play the nets and we play the raptorsIf you think the @celtics need to be concerned about who they play in the first round you haven't been watching since January 1st. Other teams need to fear them. Bring It on. 💪🏀@DanielAGreen1 Ts beregin

#NBA75 https://t.co/jIYfxFOBsLThis is a realist take, not a homer, or die-hard @Celtics fan feel good opinion.  They are NOT beating Miami, Milwaukee, or Brooklyn WITHOUT Rob Williams.  So the ONLY Boston team needing to lock a W today is @RedSox@AlexisIsKavkas @celtics We aren’t playing the nets unless we win and 76ers lose(which is highly unlikely considering they play the pistons)Hey There!

Tatum, Brown, Al, Smart, White, PP, and Theis @celtics@Wan_Baessaka @WorldWideWob The Milwaukee Bucks do not want to win their game against the Cleveland Cavaliers, so they are playing their bench players so they do not win. They do not want to win because they do not want to face the Philadelphia 76ers or the Boston Celtics, and want to face the Chicago BullsCongrats to Juwan Morgan on signing with the @celtics.

The nets for obvious reasons, the raptors bc they are much tougher than the bulls, and they don’t want to deal w the vax issue 

Gotta think Brad is smart enough. 

3 seed #celtics 

Great road team. 

#bleedgreen@celtics should want the 2 seed no matter who they play. The nets have to win in order to be the 7, no guarantees they get it, 2 seed guarantees home court the first 2 rounds. Play to win, the rest sorts itself out.@RobArtboi @GrizzliesPR @memgrizz @celtics Should be about winning, but for some it may be entertainment… Guess all sports is ultimately about entertainment &amp; earnings.. the opportunity to play one of the NBA’s best teams (since December /January) before heading into the playoffs is one that should not be passed up…real shameless. @celtics BRING IN THE TANK@NBA The Boston Celtics next great star.If I'm @celtics I'm doing what Bucks did &amp; "resting all my starters." Both teams wouldn't admit it but both wld rather play @chicagobulls in 1st Rnd instead of Nets. Bucks made that clear by resting everyone vs Cavs. Now it's Celtics turn to lay down vs Memphis ensuring #3 seed@Pavel9792 @tatumvp_ @TheNewPrince_ @celtics @memgrizz @NBCSBoston @NBAonTNT @985TheSportsHub Lol....They down 40 in the 2nd quarter.Boston Celtics Daily Links   4/10/22 https://t.co/q366f3e2Ut https://t.co/g8ZMAX5lWp@BoLiu0701 @msc_pierce @celtics @memgrizz @NBCSBoston @NBAonTNT @985TheSportsHub Celtics haven’t played yet.

We clinched the 2 seed. Why would we play starters with the slightest chance of them getting hurt before the playoffs? It also gives the B team if you will a chance to really play some full games to work towards playoff time.@GrizzliesPR @memgrizz @celtics Just give me some Jitty at point and I'm for it. Melton looked out of his element trying to create shots for everyone else against the Suns, and they'll want to keep his catch-and-shoot game sharp for the playoffs.

To view this bet or copy it https://t.co/EpJCUM7gNd https://t.co/CXbrihIa4I@VYPEIndy @Bucks @celtics My bad if both lose bucks stay 2nd and Philly would move to 3rd if they were to win. But if Celtics win and bucks lose, I believe Celtics would jump the bucks. Philly wins and Celtics lose, sixers would jump the Celtics.10 Apr 1921:
