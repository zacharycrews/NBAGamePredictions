#TeamParieur https://t.co/dGNRgelOTjInteresting fact:

The Utah Jazz are now the only team in the #NBA that hasn‚Äôt had any of its players in the league‚Äôs health and safety protocols during the 2021-22 season."Freeing" is an interesting word to use there. I agree. I think these are the kinds of guys the Utah Jazz should pick up to bolster their roster for a playoff run. Let Snyder coach him up. He'll be a weapon down the stretch.

Golden State has been the most dominant team this season, and they play with Green/Looney at the same time.

Is spacing üíØ overrated when you can execute?

Ben Simmons üíØ would help the Utah Jazz‚Ä¶no doubts about this at ALL.Two true sentences:

Per Shams, "The Utah Jazz are pursuing a defensive-minded wing on the trade market."

and

@BenSimmons25 is the best wing defender in the NBA and he is available for trade.
