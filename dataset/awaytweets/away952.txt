Not beating GSW w/o Kawhi's doesn't mean that they couldn't have beaten GSW with him. Ppl look at the Spurs like they look at other teams. But San Antonio is always different. If they get Kawhi, theyll match GSW's level because that maximizes everybody else. Makes more sense?The San Antonio Spurs have upgraded Devin Vassell and Lonnie Walker IV to available for tonight.

Devontae Cacok, Robert Woodard II, and D.J. Stewart Jr. are with the Austin Spurs in the G League.@goatedwok @k_wainwrightt @gtfomd05 @Bagchasinmo @KawhisFavBurner @SirRobertBuford @ClubAugustinFan @oldnbatweetz What does that have to do with anything, respectively? San Antonio figures teams out by games 3-4. That's y GSW got shut down after game 2. Spurs should've won games 2-5 but they blew game 4. Gsw ran into a brick wall after the 1st two games.

How appropriate would it be for the Spurs to grab a player from his last team? #CoachK@oldnbatweetz 2013 San Antonio Spurs. They was a few seconds away from winning the 2013 NBA Finals. They had the Miami Heat on the rope but Ray Allen hit a game tying 3 pointer and LeBron took over in overtime to win Game 6. Also LeBron took over from start to finish to win Game 7.@nathanmarzion He wore this jersey because we almost beat the San Antonio Spurs that year, if not for a crazy finish to game 1‚Ä¶ manu lol we could of went up 2-0‚Ä¶ that and he‚Äôs a warriors fanRadio Play-By-Play Voice of the San Antonio Spurs Bill Schoening on Calling His 2000th Straight Game

#NBA #bet #dataanalyst #entrepreneurship@SirRobertBuford @ClubAugustinFan @oldnbatweetz EXACTLY. Fans don't realize that San Antonio dominated them and we're up 20+ points in, I believe, all but 1 game against GSW that year. The Spurs being up 25 in game 1 wasn't a fluke. Pop knows how to play the warriors. And let alone Kawhi, but GSW was lucky TP was hurt tooNo 8th seed has ever won the NBA Finals. 

The 1999 New York Knicks are the only 8th seed that has made it to the Finals. They lost 4‚Äì1 to the San Antonio Spurs.

If the Brooklyn Nets stay in the 8th &amp; have things break their way, we could see history.

Scariest 8th seed ever.Consensus Line Move:
2022-03-05 San Antonio Spurs at Charlotte Hornets from 240.50 to 239.00

"A lot of good things came from our defense", De'Aaron Fox said and the Kings have to build on their 48-mins effort.
