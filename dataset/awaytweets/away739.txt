They don’t have 2019-20 regular season point guard Lebron that led the NBA with 10.2 assists. Lebron can register his own Triple-doubles and make logo 3s at point guard.@OVOLakeShow This was a Washington Wizards style game, NOT LAKERS TRADITION.Saturday's Free Pick: Washington Wizards +5.5

It's a good time to 'buy low' on the Washington Wizards after going 0-4 SU &amp; 0-4 ATS in their last four games overall.  Three of the four losses came by 4 points or fewer, including two by a single point.DasHaus made a bet!
