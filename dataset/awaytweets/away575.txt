Nobody wanted to believe him, but he was right all along.@Smith4Gm @Timgeorge78 @RefTheDistrict Minnesota Timberwolves were the obstacle. Chris Russell told us thatHakeem Profit

They would allow a lesser league to use it but not the NFL which would overshadow them.MINNESOTA TIMBERWOLVES vs

“2022 NBA Champion Minnesota Timberwolves”

“Wolves in 4”

“Wow you were right, Karl-Anthony Town really *is* the greatest shooting big man of all time”

“Remember when people thought Golden State won the DLo trade lol”Anthony Edwards *22-5-2* and the Minnesota Timberwolves beat D'Angelo Russell *19-2-5* and the Oklahoma City Thunder 98-90 (2022-01-05)@pman3776 @VaRedWolves @WashingtonNFL It's not the university. It was the Minnesota Timberwolves NBA team. They own rights to every version of wolf and didn't want to share with a larger sport/ bigger team.  The university's were fine.  NBA has plenty of money and lawyers also to combat NFL.Congratulations to KG__BigTicket who moved up 143 spots to take #70 on the Minnesota Timberwolves team leaderboard.

“Kwame Brown By The Numbers”
By: Marlawn Heavenly VII https://t.co/ZS17H7l7rc@superozman @bdalhart52112 Haha I did see that. But come on, that one would be a lot easier to work around than the Minnesota Timberwolves or Arkansas State if they wanted to. It’s not even a team.And the Andrew Wiggins spin move is... certified

This move was refined way back in the Minnesota Timberwolves days https://t.co/FYialzgGy1
