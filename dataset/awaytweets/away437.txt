#GamblingTwitter https://t.co/TAJG2Soe5B@GrizzOnBally @dillonbrooks24 @JaMorant @memgrizz Swea 👈🏿Been really curious about the Memphis Grizzlies’ recent success without Ja Morant. Did some digging…this is not good: https://t.co/hhJBSzgx3J@mustardrlysucks @5StraightFinaIs @statmuse @memgrizz @GrizzliesPR @dillonbrooks24 @jarenjacksonjr @DBane0625 Don’t say cornball when you’re white thanks@bzbx @memgrizz @NBA Doesn’t matter. It’s league rules. I sure don’t want Grizz players to get it from Kings players. We’re on a roll.@RagingBull424 @GrizzOnBally @dillonbrooks24 @JaMorant @memgrizz How you know just curious ?@MemphisHustle @memgrizz @ShaqLeroy @MAHDTHAGOD Congrats!👏@Titanfan86 @GrizzliesPR @memgrizz @SacramentoKings From what I hear, Clarke is the furthest away from returning of the four..@memgrizz status update: Santi Aldama (RT calf soreness) had been added to the report as questionable for Friday's game against @SacramentoKings. https://t.co/Z1uJq6eqWjThe Memphis Grizzlies without Morant has a better record than the Dallas Mavs with healthy players@memgrizz @trailblazers Classless and immature. I’m pretty sure the @trailblazers account actually shouted you out and said good game after they bounced you in the bubble. I guess this is what it looks like to suck for decades and then finally start winning. Grow up 🙄Southwest:
