We explained how stupid that was,citing last years play.  So then he pretended that what he said is that the team was worse with Ja in the first 10 games. Something that no one would argue against. He's a salty casual.@MaxxTheOne1 @grindfoul @lane_chm @statmuse @memgrizz @GrizzliesPR @dillonbrooks24 @jarenjacksonjr @DBane0625 What you said and what you meant are different. That's on you. The man provided a screenshot and we can see what you said. "He makes them worse." Take the L for your stupid comment.@StephChambers76 @memgrizz @GettySport @dillonbrooks24 Dillon approves https://t.co/awGUUftAPECOVID-19 is doing a number on the league (and world), and the Sacramento Kings are a victim of it right now.
