#LoveThemKings@OverDrive1050 the last time the Sacramento Kings were relevant was The Rock's promo on them https://t.co/3HTmasXz8nArgree with Hayes here, the second I think of irrelevant sports teams the @SacramentoKings are the first team that comes to mind. @OverDrive1050@HayesTSN the only thing the Sacramento Kings are famous for is Shaq calling them the Queens.The Sacramento Kings constant back &amp; forth that “all of our best players are not on the trade table” then “all of our best players are back on the trade table” is comical.
