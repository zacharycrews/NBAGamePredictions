It's a bandwagon sports town (sorry to say) and the fans won't come around until the team is in the playoffs.@Charlottean28 The Pistons have two real trade assets. One is Grant and one is an untouchable Cade Cunningham. That’s the list.

@NBA2K | @CadeCunningham_ https://t.co/jOtok2k6mJ@dinna_dawg When I was still trying learning the game, the '04 champs Detroit Pistons were a team my dad liked. He liked the Pistons since the Bad Boys' era. So come the '05 NBA Finals, the Pistons are back and against the SAN ANTONIO SPURS. Got hooked to them champs and a guy named MANU!@PistonPowered @TheBukShow I don't think Chad's take was "silly" per se.  It's tough to find bigs with Mobley's skills..&amp; the undersized Pistons certainly could really use a guy like him. I still like Cade as the choice though because Detroit needs Cade's winning personality as much as it needs his skill.Bet you guys didn’t know Dick Vitale coached the Detroit Pistons@DetroitPistons @47 Be cool if I could purchase with Doge like the @dallasmavsshop@PistonOfTheDay @Detroit_Stan14 Bey and Cade are both shooting much better now but overall % will never fully recover from their bad start! Pistons with Killian and Stewart on the floor not being offensive threats just created bad basketball and everything was ISO play at the end of the shot clock as a result.@kenthomson87 @ChristianWinn @DetroitPistons @badboyhorn44 Mahorn was the baddest of the ‘Bad Boys’Rep your Detroit #Pistons and keep warm with this @47 Static Cuff 3️⃣1️⃣3️⃣ Navy Knit.

https://t.co/FH17oXzihI@ObdulioGarcia19 @ZachLowe_NBA I don't think that is it. The question is what Detroit values him as, and what is available on the market. 

Teams want Grant, but the Pistons seem to want multiple 1st round picks. That is a significant ask, especially as the team essentially has to sign-up to extend Grant.@DetroitPistons @OrlandoMagic @BallySportsDET @971theticketxyt @Shopify @AmwayCenter I’ll be at the game tonight!!!Detroit Pistons vs  Orlando Magic Prediction 1/28/22 -  Free NBA Picks https://t.co/t53qiHGcRu via @YouTube

https://t.co/LcCBBkwPJ5@Matt__Hansen3 @esidery @basketbllnews Bud, Jerami Grant transitioned from a tertiary scorer/roleplayer into the guy in Detroit. He isn't going to want to play a Jae Crowder/Cam Johnson type role for the Suns, and the Pistons have said they're not even sure they want to trade him.You didn’t see this @DetroitPistons @Pacers @SacramentoKings https://t.co/D1mNWbiL1b https://t.co/WoVsCLhliWThe Lakers run no type of offense for Russ to succeed. I haven’t saw Russ in a pick and roll since they played the pistons in Detroit. Put Russ in a p&amp;r with AD, Bron whatever.Detroit Pistons repping the D and Black culture https://t.co/FxpVOR19to@SethPartnow Absolutely not. I think Grant is overrated playing on a horrible Detroit Pistons team. If he was so great and not just a padded statline on a bad team the pistons would be a better team and not one of the worst the last two years.
