The second game of their home stand, with a tough game against the @Bucks on Wednesday. Let’s add to that win column! #LetsGoCavs@MaxxTheOne1 @justindimez @NBAHistory @nyknicks Dame and CJ were the alphas there and Melo had to take a back seat to them. With his career interrupted Melo wasn’t able to call his own shots like CP3 and Lebron. But Melo is still just as good at what he’s always done(scoring) as Lebron and CP3 are at what they’ve always done@The__Cooler @chadfordinsider @KentuckyMBB @nyknicks Yeah totally agree.  I think Houston has BK's pick though....plus I'm sure the @nyknicks will be picking ahead of them.  He may not drop that far though.@nyknicks we miss you @drose 💪💪@nyknicks OriGinal used to be my tag...The #NBA matchups for today, where's the upset going to be?

Find out now. #Picks #Sportsbook https://t.co/l6UQiMQyx4@J1gg__ The @nyknicks have the wrong coach. He acts like he has 5 rings. He has self destructed everywhere he has been. His rotations and offensive sets are terrible. But worst of all he plays his favorites and buries good players because of his ego.The #Knicks are heavy 6-point dogs in a VERY low total game against the #Cavs tonight.

Knicks +6.5 and o 202🔒Fire thibs pleaseeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee I want him gone @nyknicks https://t.co/Gue2ZZhrat@NYPost_Berman Gotta believe the @nyknicks will be active at the trade deadline, so this is TBD at best.  Kemba isn't working out, there's a logjam at the 2-3 spot, and the team still needs a PG and maybe a stretch 4.  We'll see what Feb 10 brings.  Hopeful there's moves coming.@iamrocknation @jfromflorida1 @cavs @nyknicks Apparently there's a report in the post, kemba back, Burks to 2nd unit, tibs going to 9 man rotation and sticking with grimes.On this day in 2014, Carmelo Anthony erupted for franchise record and career-high 62 points for the Knicks! 🔥🤩

Go back and watch the games and see how many games Thibs cost us.  Maybe your just not intelligent to understand how bad he is.  He has been fired twice already in his career and he will be fired by Knicks.  Count on that.Miami have two days off before their next game, which is against the New York Knicks.
