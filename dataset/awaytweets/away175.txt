#SalsaDetroit #BachataNights #DetroitVsEverybody @ Detroit, Michigan https://t.co/hiXQiNuuyi@McCandyA @MarkMe60 I'm not saying he doesn't deserve the calls. It's definitely game management by the refs. It's what the Detroit Pistons did to Michael Jordan. They would foul him constantly and dare the refs to blow the whistle knowing they wouldn't otherwise all the players would foul outCommunity Champions 🎽🏆

It’s time to work with each team to incorporate arena sounds into the game. I want to hear, “Jaaaaa!” and, “Joooones” and the Super Grizz theme before the 4th quarter.
