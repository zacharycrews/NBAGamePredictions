@ahahah762 @tay78232525 @HallSimpleton Jordan played for the GOAT Phil Jackson. He never won even once in the 80s. Never won without Pippen.

He finally won when:

Kareem retired. 
Bird's back went out.

Too late now for let's try the same crap that BOTH the Brooklyn Nets and Lakers failed at = Big-3 narratives. Goodbye Westbrook https://t.co/HzYZn0QrVV@VityaBitch @nahano__ @Dom_2k Was loved by the Washington Wizards fans, messed up a good thing. 👎 https://t.co/WRqOzvoSB3I said it from the jump lol he was washed before he left Washington not saying he can’t play but he definitely isn’t anybody besides the lakers starting PG every other team solid or the magic 😂 the Wizards https://t.co/uJkdb1IlMCBeal's loyalty to Washington is truly honorable. He's a rare bread of players we only wish to have more of in the league.
BUT Giving Beal a supermax this summer comes at the expense of the Wizards future. I love Beal but is this really the right move for both sides?
