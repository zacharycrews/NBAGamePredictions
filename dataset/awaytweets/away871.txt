@caleb_r29 @ChiSportUpdates @SacramentoKings He's probably the coach that Lonzo has been at his best tbh@ChiSportUpdates @SacramentoKings Don't blame him! Best PG in the League https://t.co/vqSSf2QYVg@James_HamNBA @SacramentoKings This is probably our best starting lineup. Defensively versatile and decent offensively.

#Sacramento kings 
#NBA https://t.co/Moi2Zbf9J0@ChiSportUpdates @SacramentoKings But he didn’t even know how to Lonzo properly 🤦🏽‍♂️No lie since Sacramento is more developed now ARCO Arena would be a perfect to host Kings games lol but they decided “let’s put a stadium in crowded ass downtown next to a highway”Sacramento Kings head coach Alvin Gentry coached Chicago Bulls point guard Lonzo Ball in New Orleans and said that Lonzo is one of his favorite players that he ever coached. 

Gentry said the Bulls have a great chance to go deep in the playoffs.

When I look at the west, I don’t see them beating any other team for a playoff spot. This will cause Sabonis to leave in free agency in 2024.

Money flushed down the toilet. https://t.co/OqMXzsRx9hGreat job by @blaylockboyz in representing our group @CrownDowntown as he was interviewed by @LukeCleary of @ABC10.

Thank you, Councilwoman for your leadership on this! Let’s go!@TheNBACentral @PlayersTribune @SacramentoKings your front office is useless. Utterly useless.@KathyApplebaum @AngeliqueAshby @DrPanMD @CNU_Med @SacramentoKings @TheCityofSac A ZOO would have been better, but like the homeless… the city can’t make money off them@AngeliqueAshby @CNU_Med @SacramentoKings @TheCityofSac Don’t ask me to cut back on my water, when we don’t have any after all this building irresponsible building. https://t.co/BlSVuwMei2@SacramentoKings @hbarnes @socios Took my best friend since first grade to go see the kings play the suns for his birthday in Phoenix where we go to school! Sitting in the nose bleeds we went nuts when he hit the buzzer beater three! A night I’ll never forget! #SacramentoProud https://t.co/s0MMhilC7mthey said he was back because he shot 6-9 against the Sacramento Kings. https://t.co/89Y8bGXitW“Shit we got to get rid of this dope, who would to be here in Sacramento?” - kings front office https://t.co/V9qkS7Z4aM@KathyApplebaum @DrPanMD @CNU_Med @SacramentoKings @TheCityofSac No city subsidy has been requested  thus far.They're the team I wish the @SacramentoKings are@SacramentoKings @hbarnes @socios Game winner.

@CNU_Med hospital and higher ed will replace the former @SacramentoKings arena in @TheCityofSac 

$1b project - 1500 construction jobs
$12b over 10 yrs - 6000 jobs ongoing 

Childcare, housing (10% affordable), 25 acres of parks &amp; bike paths, union labor. https://t.co/1bgQxfcgVcThe Sacramento Kings are 22-37... they're only 2-1/2 games out of a play-in tourney game. I think it's time for the #NBA to go back to its pre-pandemic playoff system. No one wants to see Phoenix tackle a 15-game under .500 NBA team come playoff time. (Sorry to you Kings fans)@SalSports @SneakyJoeSports 2002 Sacramento Kings gotta be #1. WCF game 6 officiating in the 4th quarter was LA bias. If you have some downtime this offseason listen to the Whistleblower podcast on the Tim Donaghy scandal. There’s an entire episode dedicated to this game. Awesome podcast with a deep dive.@Mayor_Steinberg @CNU_Med @TheCityofSac @AngeliqueAshby @SacramentoKings I'm thinking that I could celebrate with family in:  Old Sac, McKinley Park or Land Park. 

But you Darrell - the views that YOUR council supports on "defunding police" AND homeless programs has turned our City into a shit hole. 

And then, all of you run for higher office....The concept of the color change to purple when the @SacramentoKings win is a nice touch. When that building is up and running we expect it to change to purple a lot. Go Kings! https://t.co/vZQNiIPwEXTonight we approved land use entitlements for the  @CNU_Med hospital on the site of the former Sleep Train Arena. This project would be a major job center for Natomas and for @TheCityofSac. Special thanks to @AngeliqueAshby and @SacramentoKings.  https://t.co/WhfCcGgX5f@cedricshine I don’t call you poverty. You just have bad ownership. Plus poverty doesn’t sell out even when they’re trash which y’all do. You could argue the Knicks have been the worst since 2000 but the wolves and Sacramento kings and Charlotte hornets haven’t been much better@FCartoscelli3 SAC received better shooters to replace him? One of the best 3P shooters in NBA. Not good enough for great and invincible Sacramento Kings franchise, but for the rest of the world good enough to be considered steal of this trade. Buddy haters need some support, how to spin this? https://t.co/EeLyEI9wvH@SacramentoKings @hbarnes @socios Buzzer beater against suns easy.

Cute effort though. Here’s your 40th loss, Sacramento Kings of the East.@SacramentoKings @hbarnes @Rich_Holmes22 @Dsabonis11 @nemi1599 I gotta I follow you guys now that y’all traded Buddy😢🇧🇸
It was a good ride and great memories Thank You #SacTown #242totheworld@SacramentoKings fans, this is easily one of the most fun things about the Kings franchise. Also i want to hear Jerry Reynolds use bad words. https://t.co/6xQ2hgmXRkBuddy Hield won by getting traded out of Sacramento. Now his potential can be reached without being held down by Kings management and poor coaching.@SacramentoKings @hbarnes @socios Hands down gotta be the phoenix suns game winner showed us all we can beat anyone when we play the game the correct way, it was almost like winning a championship almost!!!!@MegaZane5 NBA: Sacramento Kings
NFL: Jacksonville Jags@SpursUpNext 2002 Sacramento kings. Clearly would’ve won the finals but refs even admitted they rigged it, Sacramento had issues after that series never was the same, we may be talking chris Webber all time and Peja would get more recognition. Sad such a forgettable team@SacramentoKings @Divincenzo @JustHolla7 @swipathefox @Chimezie_Metu @TreyLyles play neemy@SacramentoKings I still have not been assigned a Kings player based off my astrological sign.... 🙄@BrendanSchaub @PunchLineSac @SacKingsPR @SacramentoKings @KingsTeamStore is this a legal use of the Kings logo?Woah!

All time fav Tar Heel@CrownDowntown I remember that son.  Didn't the Maloof's still want to move the #sacramentokings@SacramentoKings @hbarnes @socios Harrison barnes calm and 1 while metu goes crazySacramento Kings versus the Chicago Bulls #BullsThe #Celtics' biggest lead of the season was 60 points against the Sacramento Kings last month.

I didn't think we'd ever come close to breaking that.@SacramentoKings @SMUDUpdates Fire him@SacramentoKings fans gotta be so mad.

straight up.@SacramentoKings @hbarnes @socios Suns game-winner, hands down. https://t.co/djujFoB1hpsee the thing is I always been a Celtics fan I loved the Sacramento Kings too at one point@SacramentoKings @hbarnes @socios Gotta be the game winner against the Cavs. Ice in the veins for sure@SacramentoKings @hbarnes @socios Every slow roll move he makes to the basket. We luv our vetFox 🦊 and Ox 🐂

Probably not even his fault maybe it was coach's fault. He's a Sacramento Kings. If that Domino doesn't fall it changes the history of the team in all likelihood@Debi27771215 @KingsNationCP It’s more about pointing out how big of a mistake the Kings organization made. They found maybe the one person who actually wants to be in Sacramento, who is a rising star in the game, who was invested in the community, and then they trade him away.@SacramentoKings @hbarnes @socios CAW CAW! The black falcon’s game winner against the suns was awesome. So much fun and so much excitement watching from home. Mr. Consistent FTW!@SacramentoKings @hbarnes @socios Definitely his game winner vs the Cavs. The pass, the dribble, the fadeaway shot at the horn, and then the celebration with the whole team. Loved it. https://t.co/xivobTSFeP@SacramentoKings @hbarnes @socios That Harrison Barnes buzzer beater to beat the one seeded phoenix sunsThe @SacramentoKings because they don't have time for podcasts. #BBI https://t.co/e0OwNNZhvO@AdamSchein Try being a Sacramento Kings fanWith people coming up with #FoxAndOx merch, I was thinking. What if they made a Wuzzle? You can hold a design contest for the kids. Fire up the community involvement with a bit of creativity. @disney @SacramentoKings @vivek

EasyThis was Aaron Nesmith's first 3 point basket since January 25 against the Sacramento Kings, when the #Celtics won by 53 points.

Almost 10 games without a 3. https://t.co/rPwWiD0ob4@SacramentoKings @hbarnes @socios My favorite is when he defended Andrew Bouget’s big man passing ability during a recent interview! Barnes is a man of honor, character, and loyalty! Those are the kind of players I respect!@SacramentoKings @hbarnes @socios The 3 point game winner. I own the topshot moment as well.Can we get some 🦊 and the 🐂 stuff @SacramentoKings@SacramentoKings @hbarnes @socios either the putback shot against the jazz or the game winner against the cavs@HiveCards @UniqueFinds09 Sacramento kings auto lot

Take both for $15 pwe https://t.co/UjwZL2J9QW@SacramentoKings @hbarnes @socios His game winning shot against the Suns for sureeeee@SacramentoKings @hbarnes @socios Obviously Harrison’s game winner against Phoenix, great way to start the season!@SacramentoKings @hbarnes @socios Everyone is going to say buzzer beater but truth is can't pick a play, dude works his butt off and hustles on every play, so my answer would have to be Every play is my favorite@SacramentoKings @hbarnes @socios Game winner vs Suns no other moment comes close tbh
