The only thing you can say for sure is what has happened. The fact is we lost against those teams. We still play the nets, bucks, warriors, and jazz so we have a chance to make up for our previous losses.Some highlights from the @Timberwolves @cavs game last Friday! #Timberwolves #Cavs #nba #NBAonTNT #NBA75 https://t.co/Jky69HbcEA@AkiW_M @papyfaye1 @cavs @_bigjayy_ @notthefakeSVP @SportsCenter 7th best offense??? We're like 19th or something like that. Nowhere near top 10. And you have to understand basketball, the playoffs are about who's best player can beat your best player. The hawks were about team ball and we used to destroy them in the playoffs.Nike Men’s Cleveland Cavaliers NBA Dri-Fit 100% Polyester T-Shirt (Large, Red AR5805) https://t.co/AnFfgecWZi@Studiosofbeach1 @Durcanttt @cavs @_bigjayy_ @notthefakeSVP @SportsCenter The difference is we still competed when we were down and the teams we played that were depleted get blown out. If we had just one of our 6-7 guys that were out back we would have won those games. Can’t be said for other teams.@Studiosofbeach1 @papyfaye1 @cavs @_bigjayy_ @notthefakeSVP @SportsCenter i see no reason why we couldn’t take any team in the league to 6 or 7 right now, even advance. we have the second best defence in the league and like the 7th best offence and we’ve had the second hardest schedule. we’re the 4th seed for a reason, this team is so much betterThe Kyrie 7 helps players at all levels take advantage of their quick first step. Keep the quickness going and cop before they are all gone

My husband &amp; I come to games often &amp; I’d love to help teach the fans/employees about it! Maybe even the @kevinlovefund could be involved too! #tics #tourettesyndrome #awarenessmatters1) Video about my tics during the @cavs game we went to on Monday! I often feel that there is so much going on that people don’t notice my tics which makes me feel a bit better. But ticcing in public is always a not so great feeling. https://t.co/FGhD47k7rN
