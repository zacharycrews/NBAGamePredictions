That's about as much sense as the right being mad about the #SCOTUS leak right now.Current order of favorite to least of remaining NBA Playoff teams:

The 76ers are mainly looking at Assistant Coach Sam Cassell, Mike D’Antoni and Milwaukee Bucks assistant Darvin Ham.”While taking four games out of seven from the Miami Heat is a tough ask for any team, Paul Reed is right: The Philadelphia #76ers can make this a series yet.
