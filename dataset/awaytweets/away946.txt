He‚Äôll miss tonight, but be back in action tomorrow in Memphis. https://t.co/DBRYs2soFm@OfficialNBARefs suck... Especially when officiating the @OrlandoMagic https://t.co/mKTEPxkams@OrlandoMagic @MarkelleF ‚ÄúFultz is actually making us way too competitive so he‚Äôs not allowed to play this game‚Äù@OrlandoMagic @MarkelleF markelle fultz@OrlandoMagic @MarkelleF Heart attack tweetüö®INJURY UPDATE:
@OrlandoMagic guard Markelle Fultz will not play tonight at Toronto due to left knee injury management.

Fultz is scheduled to play tomorrow night at Memphis.

He played 140 games in his career for the Magic.@PapageorgiouMBO @NBA @OrlandoMagic If the Magic are clearly in rebuild mode, sit players on purpose, and put a disgusting product on the floor for 3/4‚Äôs of the season, why does this matter? It‚Äôs basically what the Magic are asking for.. great research for sure, but this isn‚Äôt some eye opening revelation to me.@RaptorsBrazil @br_orlandomagic lets gooooo!! üî•üî•üî•@OrlandoMagic @Raptors @BallySportsFL @RjHampton14 Please beat the raptors

Why do us like this.  We are losing,  but we want to win one day.  We decline and would like to pass it along to Ice Tray and the Atlanta Hawks.@Mellllqui @hazzabassman @HSB6_ @RP3toughscene @thezachattack_2 @Dom_2k I‚Äôm not a representative of the Orlando Magic community. But chances are you‚Äôll get stuck with @BolWrld so therefore I as a representative of the Boston Celtics community‚Ä¶ veto the message to Orlando and pass it along to the San Antonio Spurs.This is great research. The @NBA uses the Magic as a test subject for refereeing. And it‚Äôs no coincidence how awfully officiated a lot of @OrlandoMagic games have been this season. https://t.co/m3AeiceShhFriday is the perfect day to enjoy our luxurious "Gamberoni Portofino."

@CityofAltamonte @SeminoleCoFL @OrlandoMagic https://t.co/ZI8VfBgjv9It's easy to forget that both the Magic and Raptors have 4 rotation to semi-rotation players in their 1st or 2nd years. Looking forward to this game tonight, especially with Markelle Fultz back.

Toronto is on the end of a b2b after losing to their bogey team (and the ghost of Dwane Casey's past). 
Orlando has won 2 of their last 3 w their one loss being in OT. 
This game won't be pretty but there seems to be a bit of belief in the Magic.üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
