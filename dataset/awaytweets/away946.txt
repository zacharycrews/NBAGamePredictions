Pat Riley gave him a call and tried getting him to come to Miami for the formation of a super-team.I'd like to see Jaden drafted by the Magic tbh. The jerseys are clean. The fans are loyal and always support their guys. Yes they have Suggs, Fultz, Anthony, and Hampton.

Can the Raps shake off last night’s loss and get back on track? Preview!  https://t.co/4HFkOBRe0CRevenge Game: Khem Birch plays Orlando tonight.  He played 140 games in his career for the Magic.@PapageorgiouMBO @NBA @OrlandoMagic If the Magic are clearly in rebuild mode, sit players on purpose, and put a disgusting product on the floor for 3/4’s of the season, why does this matter? It’s basically what the Magic are asking for.. great research for sure, but this isn’t some eye opening revelation to me.@RaptorsBrazil @br_orlandomagic lets gooooo!! 🔥🔥🔥@OrlandoMagic @Raptors @BallySportsFL @RjHampton14 Please beat the raptors

I mean. Just, wow. I love data!! Thank you for sharing this!@Mellllqui @hazzabassman @HSB6_ @RP3toughscene @thezachattack_2 @Dom_2k As a representative of th Orlando Magic 
Why do us like this.  We are losing,  but we want to win one day.  We decline and would like to pass it along to Ice Tray and the Atlanta Hawks.@Mellllqui @hazzabassman @HSB6_ @RP3toughscene @thezachattack_2 @Dom_2k I’m not a representative of the Orlando Magic community. But chances are you’ll get stuck with @BolWrld so therefore I as a representative of the Boston Celtics community… veto the message to Orlando and pass it along to the San Antonio Spurs.This is great research. The @NBA uses the Magic as a test subject for refereeing. And it’s no coincidence how awfully officiated a lot of @OrlandoMagic games have been this season. https://t.co/m3AeiceShhFriday is the perfect day to enjoy our luxurious "Gamberoni Portofino."

@CityofAltamonte @SeminoleCoFL @OrlandoMagic https://t.co/ZI8VfBgjv9It's easy to forget that both the Magic and Raptors have 4 rotation to semi-rotation players in their 1st or 2nd years. Looking forward to this game tonight, especially with Markelle Fultz back.

https://t.co/nIw9E0UHwrI believe Vogel can coach a championship team, but when the team isn’t playing well, man is he an awful coach. It’s no wonder the Orlando Magic and Indiana Pacers fired him.Magic @ Raptors

Toronto is on the end of a b2b after losing to their bogey team (and the ghost of Dwane Casey's past). 
Orlando has won 2 of their last 3 w their one loss being in OT. 
This game won't be pretty but there seems to be a bit of belief in the Magic.🧙‍♂️
