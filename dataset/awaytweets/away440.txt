That and an entire league that knows why the Skins have been bad since ‚Äò99The sad truth is, the Orlando Magic would be the #1 seed in the East if they had just kept Janis Timma on the roster.

Cons: it's Orlando. At Christmas. 

Pros: it's a nonstop flights, we're 2 hours to a beach, there's 3 pools, we're going with favorite friends, and it's 80 degrees. And I own a 4yo who is VERY into Disney magic right now. ‚ú®Another of the four players called up from the @lakelandmagic against Miami, Aleem Ford made NBA and @OrlandoMagic debut.

@aleemford became the 271st player in franchise history, playing 7 first half minutes, scoring a bucket and grabbing a steal.

#MagicTogether #AleemFord https://t.co/bTHAqAIXRlGeez. Took 2:45 to get to #Orlando for the #Magic -#Heat game! 6 Magic 6 ORL players injured and 5 went into Covid Protcols today. For the Heat, no Bam, Jimmy Butler, Tyler Herro. See not about 2:39 getting home. No reason we shouldn‚Äôt have the #NBA in #TampaBay!This looks like an Orlando Magic signing https://t.co/8F16u1kpZuPer the Hornets media guide, the 81 points allowed by Charlotte in the first half ties a franchise record set back on 1/24/1994; a 145-120 loss to Orlando. Magic shot 65% from the field in that one, Portland shooting 64.4% at the half.One of the four players called up from the @LakelandMagic for this game, Admiral Schofield made his long awaited @OrlandoMagic debut.

Schofield became the 270th player in franchise history, logging 12minutes, scoring a bucket and assisting on a second.
