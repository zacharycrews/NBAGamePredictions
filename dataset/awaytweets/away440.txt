Chuma Okeke had his best game of the season with 18 points, 10 rebounds &amp; 6 steals as the Magic fall short.

No reason we shouldn’t have the #NBA in #TampaBay!This looks like an Orlando Magic signing https://t.co/8F16u1kpZuPer the Hornets media guide, the 81 points allowed by Charlotte in the first half ties a franchise record set back on 1/24/1994; a 145-120 loss to Orlando. Magic shot 65% from the field in that one, Portland shooting 64.4% at the half.One of the four players called up from the @LakelandMagic for this game, Admiral Schofield made his long awaited @OrlandoMagic debut.

Schofield became the 270th player in franchise history, logging 12minutes, scoring a bucket and assisting on a second.
