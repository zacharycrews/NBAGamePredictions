Canada still requires a 14 day quarantine for unvaxxed travelersBTW - after trailing @nuggets by 8 PTS early 4th Quarter this past Sat., @Raptors @chrisboucher 11 PTS matched entire @nuggets squad in game's final 10 MIN &amp; 30 SEC. 
Nice, eh ?off the bench with double-double 21 PTS, 13 REB. @Raptors quite capable avoiding Play-In Tournament round being only 1 game behind 6th place @cavs in Eastern Conference standings if team continues playing this well, especially when returning from their current 6 game road trip.Having to play next nite Mar.12 on the road vs. a quality opponent @nuggets team, @Raptors clung to 1 point lead going to 4th quarter and also playing without All-Star player @FredVanVleet, resting on back-back night. @pskills43 stepped up big time with 33 PTS &amp; @chrisboucherThe Primos Just Added a pick

That sealed it for THT = separate from other teammates in Free Agency. https://t.co/iTTrNsJm2LToronto plays up to their competition so this works out for the raptors 😏 https://t.co/salhEeKp0Q@Le3ronto @spascoe7 @Raptors @TangerineHoops I totally agree he is the only player to step up. Monk, Carmelo and Westbrook are so inconsistent. When Westbrook had that decent game a couple days ago, I thought he was starting to heat up. But no the next two days he shat. When LeBron scores 50+ they win.@_kevinsousa @NHL I often wonder about that. And look at the number of times the @Raptors and @MapleLeafs play on the same day. You'd think MLSE would want to minimize the frequency of that coincidence.@JorExposed @ozhanbolatcan8 @OVOLakeShow That’s why the Toronto Raptors should have “settled” for Alex Caruso in that trade for former NBA Champion point guard Kyle Lowry. 👍 Look at what Toronto missed out on. Lakers would have Kyle Lowry, above-average perimeter defender.@JorExposed @ozhanbolatcan8 @OVOLakeShow This is where the LAKER FANBASE and the Lakers GM disagree. 😂😂😂 Why didn’t the Toronto Raptors “settle” for Alex Caruso in that Kyle Lowry trade since Caruso is so special ? https://t.co/XRbsqM5QFI@Le3ronto @spascoe7 @Raptors @TangerineHoops I love LeBron but what the heck was he doing last night Booker was putting on a clinic and James 👑 had nothing@Raptors @TangerineHoops Raptors fan from the UK, in LA on vacation, and getting to watch the team for the first time tonight! #WeTheNorthWe're thrilled that @LindsayDunnTV filed this special report on @Raptors coach Nick Nurse's music-focused foundation for Toronto kids.

NBA: Toronto Raptors -4 (-110)

Fading the Lakers after the Suns just blew them out of the building. Big problems in LA with a solid Raptors team coming to town.Literally noone is scared of the Toronto Raptors in the playoffs.. not a single team, a single player, a single soul, a single atom... a single dollar@Raptors @TangerineHoops This or an 8am class the next morning@16to34 Solution so far: Toronto Raptors.

They're the team that plays the way I've been desperately wanting the Leafs to play like. When the going gets tough, the team gets going. When one man goes down, another stands up. No 'big man', yet they play big. Effort AND Skill. pEtc etc..."TSN’s Jay and Dan respond to the lack of Raptors coverage in the US: “Who cares?”"

Maybe I just chose to look at his talent like the refs but it seems they figured out shortly after me the cheap shots he was giving out!  That gets him out of the MVP race in my eyes!  Great win!!!@Raptors @TangerineHoops Please win. Don’t wanna lose sleep to see a loss@DLittleMLB There's negative percent chance the jays don't play all their games in Toronto unless the border is closed again. Blue Jays players as well as any team in Canada (Raptors, the 7 nhl teams,  the mls teams) all have to be vaccinated to play in US. This isn't a Canada rule butRT: Raptors: Late night hoops 🏀
