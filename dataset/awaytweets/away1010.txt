Are the Nets not in New York aswell?@GiantsPlzWin @PayengBoi @hayescarroll_ @TrolledByPG ur pfp meaning ur a giants fan which means ur in new york meaning you’re a knicks fanHere Kellen, let me help you write the correct tweet: “Kyrie could be playing against the Knicks tomorrow if he was on any other team on the NBA. Example: if he played for the Wizards he is allowed to play in New York, just like Bradley Beal did while being unvaccinated.” https://t.co/tpvF8slSJpAka the @nyknicks are nothing that looks like success!! https://t.co/NexhFdJPOnIf Kyrie play tomorrow, we rolling up the @nyknicks EARLYYYYY 🤷🏽‍♂️Brooklyn Nets - New York Knicks

AgainThe @nyknicks aren’t that bad of a team because there’s been at least a dozen blown double digit leads this year. We can’t close out a game to save our lives and that ain’t gonna be on the coach?! I would love to see how it couldn’t be bro.

Make it happen! https://t.co/EUplpdINbv@DarrellColema20 @DaRealRob87 @NBA_NewYork But I don't even care anymore. The Knicks are the best ever and everyone wants to play for them because they have been so successful over the years and it's "The Mecca", whatever yall want to hear@DarrellColema20 @DaRealRob87 @NBA_NewYork It literally is, because my point is that if he wanted to be traded, the Pelicans will take the best offer they get. And they other guy tried to say they won't trade for someone who doesn't want to play for them, insinuating Zion only wants to play for the Knicks. You following?@BillPidto @MSGNetworks @KnicksMSGN @nyknicks @alanhahn @RebeccaHaarlow @McNuttMonica @wallyball Bill!! Pls!!!

He wanted to be drafted by the Knicks.@Mr_Wh0_Dat @DarrellColema20 @NBA_NewYork So its crazy for knicks fans to believe that a guy wants to go to the knicks after saying he would love to play there, Get upset when he doesnt get drafted by them and walks out the draft, Has two of his best friends playing there who he wants to play with etc ?@ESPNNBA U don't talk about the @chicagobulls much b/c u r wearing out our welcome with all the talk about the @nyknicks, @BrooklynNets, and @Lakers.

Moving Jules, Evan add by giving you better chemistry. Jules is selfish, not a leader, and sulks when not shooting . See bigger picture https://t.co/UfJmC6kXLX@FlurrayTalks The Knicks are a poverty franchise and they have nothing to offer. And furthermore, there is no way in hell Zion is turning down 187 milly just to go to New York and lose.@nyknicks https://t.co/lCpaXOhoEF.   One thing Knicks lack is an athletic specimen with the skill set to match . Ivey can not only be your Ja but he truly elevates the franchise. Pyrrhic wins to be play in team is plain dumb . TRADE UP FOR JI@theprof1t @NBA_NewYork @hopefulmetsfan I agree with what ur saying somewhat, but everyone in the NBA understands how to set an off ball, backcut. The rest of the Knicks shouldn’t just stand and watch the iso ball, and if someone is open off one of those actions, than the people who iso have to be willing to passNow that I finished that Knicks book for #bestshowbookclub, I’ve decided to rewatch the 30 for 30: Winning Time: Reggie Miller vs the New York Knicks.

@bestshow4life@lElijahsDad @memgrizz @nyknicks You do realize we have one of the richest owners in the league , which is different for a small market team we actually the first time ever he is also young best thing is our cap is also one of the highest cause there all young. But nice try.@lElijahsDad @memgrizz @nyknicks This tweet hurt you huh?@hhpthebook @nyknicks -Randle has the strength but his attitude ain't NY
