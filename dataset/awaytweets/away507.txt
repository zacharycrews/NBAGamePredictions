@StephCurryArg @nascrap @hornets @CrumblCookies And idk if you watched hornets last year with LaMelo but he started off getting like 10 minutes a game no matter how good he did and he still sometimes will be balling and just get like 25 min. I don’t like the way the coach does the substitutions@xochurch @nascrap @hornets @CrumblCookies i'm sad@StephCurryArg @nascrap @hornets @CrumblCookies Bouk just reminds me of graham@jaynftbeliever @TopShotShamanJ 1.

5. Memphis Grizzlies
6. San Antonio Spurs
7. Phoenix Suns
8. Utah Jazz
9. Sacramento Kings@StephCurryArg @nascrap @hornets @CrumblCookies Ish is just better for the LaMelo led team. He passes and keeps the pace up and sometimes seems like doesn’t even want to shoot and will only look for others. Bouk is rightfully looking for his own success so it’s just a better transition I feel like. It’s like graham last yearRELISTED-2020 Panini Select, Premier Level, Charlotte Hornets, LaMelo Ball 9.5 Graded Rookie Card #AllFly

#AllFly https://t.co/s37NbTsiM7@StephCurryArg @hornets @CrumblCookies For sure, and thats why I want him in the rotation. Ish is just a better ball handler/distributor than bouk so it makes sense for him to get PG minutes over Bouk.Detroit Pistons - New York Knicks
Indiana Pacers - Charlotte Hornets
Boston Celtics - Los Angeles Clippers
Memphis Grizzlies - Los Angeles Lakers

Bet slip link: https://t.co/RVEcro9aI6 https://t.co/s1XIr0m3mY@nascrap @hornets @CrumblCookies But seeing Bouk is precious, he has a lot of potential and having a pick 11 on the bench that plays for 3 minutes only hurts meCurrently the Charlotte Hornets have the most points scored as a team.

Sorry 😬 Thanks again @gordonhayward https://t.co/LKfNXetFX8Hornets fans: 

With Russell Westbrook’s struggles so far with the Lakers, don’t forget that the Hornets were rumored to be a trade suitor for Westbrook.

The rumors were put to rest when LaMelo Ball was available for Charlotte to take with the 3rd pick in the draft. https://t.co/vwnLnptn2PWes Bryant (@WesGotRange) joined @KyleBaileyClub today on the @ClubhouseKB as he recapped the @hornets dominating win over the @HoustonRockets, and Wes looks at how he thinks James Borrego has really embraced the challenges of the last month.
