John Wall open to a Wizards return and Bradley Beal wants to join the 76ers... How about a three teamer with additional draft capital headed to Washington? I'm not sure how it all would shake out, but hopefully:

That’s why washington has no leverage lmfao. This whole thing is because of what beal wants not what the sixers want. The only losers in this situation are the wizards.John Wall would welcome a return to the Wizards, @davidaldridgedc writes. 

It’s something he recently discussed with people close to him and around the league.

Should Washington bring back the five-time All-Star?
https://t.co/km7895q172 https://t.co/XVRBVA9D31Bringing this back for those hypothesizing about Beal leaving for nothing

It’s pretty unlikely that the Wizards get nothing back for Beal leaving. He’s still going to want $$$ wherever he goes, and that will favor Washington in negotiations https://t.co/bYjNxY0tX7@TheNBACentral Wizards gotta pick him up and then trade Beal for Harris and Maxey. Gives them a Big 3 of Wall, Harris and KP to attempt to stay competitive while Maxey learns under Wall after learning under Harden, making Maxey the future of Washington@WizardsMafia In other words, Beal needs the wizards to cooperate with him if he wants to go somewhere else and get similar amount of money as staying in Washington

If not, he’ll opt out and pick a team himself, but would lose like 50 Mil in comparisonReport: John Wall would welcome a reunion with the Washington Wizards https://t.co/Nk3RxBcBUwNBA 523 Washington Wizards +4Washington Wizards vs  Los Angeles Clippers Prediction 3/9/22 -  Free NB... https://t.co/9Q0vhbpugg via @YouTubeJohn Wall Rumors: Rockets PG Open to Wizards Return; Bradley Beal Not Opposed to Move #Washington #Wizards #NBA https://t.co/Cdasg8U1iT@feebeegb Laker fans stabbed KCP in the back despite that 2020 NBA Championship. 👎
