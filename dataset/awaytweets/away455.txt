Let him shoot and just cover his ass on defense and stop whining. Reggie Miller. Dell Curry. Shooters that did not play defense and there are so many more throughout NBA history. I just don’t think it’s a big deal for a team with other major issues.On this day in 2016, DeMarcus Cousins of the Sacramento Kings scored 55 points in a 126-121 win over the Portland Trail Blazers.@NBA @SacramentoKings So if everyone in the league is vaccinated why is there still health and safety protocol?? I mean fully vaccinated but still testing positive? Im confusedEverything happening in the NBA right now deserves an asterisk, but in two games without De’Aaron Fox and Davion Mitchell, Tyrese Haliburton is averaging:

24 PPG
5.0 RPG
10.5 APG
