#Raptors #RTZ
https://t.co/1ozlVDDTrB🏀@JesseSchule gives his betting breakdown ahead of the Charlotte Hornets vs Toronto Raptors matchup with tip off at 7 PM EST. The Raptors have won five straight where the Hornets have lost four straight. Can the Hornets stop their losing streak?

➡️https://t.co/OIPkGlLdi5 https://t.co/g979Dhh7wS@wyakingj Scottie Barnes (He wears number 4 for the Toronto Raptors)    

Jalen Green, also wears Number 4 for the NBA G-league Ignite, I know it shows 0 on his jersey, but I've watched Jalen for a long time now, and one of his first numbers he wore, especially in the G-league Ignite was 4 https://t.co/mq7SFQyuSwToronto Raptors are an elite organization, Kawhi shouldn't have left the 6ix@Ciry_Novva @SuperfanHornets @NBAonTNT @MELOD1P @NBAAllStar @Raptors But Allen's either the #1 or #2 reason why the Cavs are at 33-21 now.  CHA has lost 4 games in a row now.@Raptors @pskills43 Pascal is all star!!!! Just because is in Toronto the nba won't notice him.... if was in other franchise will be on top of the list!!!!@Ciry_Novva @SuperfanHornets @NBAonTNT @MELOD1P @NBAAllStar @Raptors I'm just responding to your narrative that it was because of Kawhi the @Raptors became a good team.  Yes, they needed Kawhi but at the same time, Kawhi needed them too to win the chip.  It's a team game. Kawhi couldn't do it in LA.@DerozanFan10 @SuperfanHornets @NBAonTNT @MELOD1P @NBAAllStar @Raptors Allen has been averaging 13 points his career so now because he averaging 16 and 11 in his 6th year he is more deserving than a 20 year old averaging 20,7,7 in his second??? Lol stop ittttt@Raptors @pskills43 I think he should have been named earlier this year tbh but also think this was cause they knew he wasnt getting the reserved but deserved all star nod. Either way he remains underrated but also highly in demand from every other team lol.@SuperfanHornets @Ciry_Novva @NBAonTNT @MELOD1P @NBAAllStar @Raptors I just don't agree with Lamelo fan boys saying Lamelo is &gt; FVV at this point in their careers.   They're just homers.  They either haven't seen FVV play or they're just homers.  I'm not a homer as I even said that Allen deserves it more.@DerozanFan10 @SuperfanHornets @NBAonTNT @MELOD1P @NBAAllStar @Raptors You’re telling me the reigning champions lost to a young Jason Tatum and Brown?!? Knowing damn well with kawhi that wouldn’t happen. Regular season means nothing in the playoffs but the raptors are used to knowing thatIm betting on the raptors tonight 

Im sorry @Raptors@Randomp00711062 @DalanoDimes @NBA @PelicansNBA @Raptors Yea ok@DerozanFan10 @Ciry_Novva @NBAonTNT @MELOD1P @NBAAllStar @Raptors U hating on a 20 year old kid is sad. How do you know how his career will shake out? Happy for Vanvleet but you gotta stop hating on Melo broBig week for the @Raptors and Spice was sweet. @pskills43 named #NBA East Player of the Week.

Toronto Raptors -1.5 1U. https://t.co/svFhVx1vv9@Ciry_Novva @SuperfanHornets @NBAonTNT @MELOD1P @NBAAllStar With Kawhi, @Raptors were 58-24 (.646) in regular season with Kawhi missing 22 games.  The following year, they went 53-19 (.736).  BETTER record.  That season, they were expected to miss the playoffs and yet, they reached the East Semis and lost a close G7 vs BOS.nba bet:

We’re in this!  

More importantly, the future looks great.  Build now! 

#WeTheNorth #Raptors@Raptors could find a team to trade Dragic to later.  With the leadership of the Raptors organization, I believe Simmons could debut on a positive note and produce the unexpected.  Toronto's playoff run could look a lot different with these added assets.2 absolute DOGS
Wish they were on the @Raptors @CarisLeVert https://t.co/GdajphYpLq@IanRGillespie @raptafan @Raptors Agreed. As a teenager horsing around in our skating arena, in (HMCS) Cornwallis - I fell and someone skated over my hand. Opened my palm up like someone sliced it with a razor. Quite a sight, but it wasn't too deep. Not like the time I accidentally put my hand through a window.@raptafan @Raptors Hard no. I don't want anyone jumping over a kid with blades on their feet, never, not ever. This will give me nightmares.This is the kind of @raptors content you'll only find on TikTok!

#WeTheNorth https://t.co/Wx0Z6nBdyBThe East is wild &amp; I love it...6th spot for my @Raptors squad!! https://t.co/xwa5E3zgzP@Quintssential @TheHoopCentral @MikeAScotto We don’t do business with the Celtics, real @raptors fans know this.@8ateTech @CP24 @Raptors So the city of Toronto can't handle 5,000 people on a weekend?   And they thought Rob Ford made Toronto a joke.@DominantDaddy97 @rapzcity_ @StanimalSZN I have no idea what race you are. But you aren't Woj. You're not Shams. And you're not in Toronto. So you know nothing (about upcoming Raptors trades - I'm sure you know a lot about things in your own life).Honestly this is insane, laker fans need to watch more basketball teams cause this makes 0 sense. masai wouldn’t do any of these trades in a million years. Keep ur eyes off my @Raptors, Gray Trent jr. will be a raptor for awhile https://t.co/khdnjKTBMl@zanofc @BrooklynNets @NBA Ben has a lot of ground to make up, damaged/flawed goods in many eyes. There was talk of a deal with my Toronto Raptors a few weeks ago. I’m glad they steered clear. I do love sir Patty Mills though👌@TylerUpchurch24 @mrvincecarter15 @Raptors You got one for McGrady on deck?Thought the same thing. Time for some #MasaiShopping @Raptors https://t.co/UmIhPfC3lN@TylerUpchurch24 @mrvincecarter15 @Raptors Please do a rockets player next.⁦@Raptors 🏀⁩ @chrisboucher⁩ was homeless??
