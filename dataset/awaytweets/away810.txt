*don‚Äôt forget  Henry Finkel üòÑ@statmuse @celtics Say it with me! Lamelo didn‚Äôt deserve the all star over Brown. Lamelo was 19/7/7 with 42/36/87 splits and Brown is 24/6/3 with 46/35/78      On top of this Brown is a far better defensive player than lamelo.@celtics @jaytatum0 Top 10 player in the NBA
