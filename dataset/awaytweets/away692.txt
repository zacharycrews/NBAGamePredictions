#YALLSOMEBITCHES@chicagobulls @ZachLaVine The Bulls are Soft I stand with Allen@soni_maxx @Tucker4176 @chicagobulls @ACFresh21 6-8 weeks https://t.co/9LASv7wxku@BigBallerSacks @chicagobulls @ACFresh21 Let me still this pic...I could make the same one minus the mask but I'm lazy@chicagobulls @ACFresh21 The worst part about Grayson Allen‚Äôs  Flagrant 2 on Alex Caruso is not the incident or the injury to Caruso but the fact that Allen showed no remorse meaning he‚Äôs only likely to do it again. He‚Äôs a dirty player and a  #RepeatOffender. üôèüèª up for AC!üö® LAST DAY TO VOTE üö®

He could have chosen better subject matter. The @nyknicks have not been relevant since the early 70‚Äôs. One option, the same era @chicagobulls who whipped their asses consistently.@KyleL00 @BigDickDavid69 @big_dog94 @YEEZUS__24 @chicagobulls @Bucks You were originally calling out a bucks fan for defending his team?!? So bulls fans can be upset about a call that was called more harshly than similar calls from that night but bucks fan can‚Äôt argue that it should‚Äôve been an F1???@GiannisOwnsYou @chicagobulls @Bucks Oh, yeah‚Ä¶ https://t.co/l4uSgiPVTz@boogietime12 @chicagobulls @Bucks Like your buddy? https://t.co/l4uSgiPVTz@chicagobulls @ACFresh21 Get well soon @ACFresh21 üôè
