He has to step up if the @celtics are going to beat the @warriors in the finals. Either that or the @celtics defense has to take Steph Curry out of the game and that is unlikely.@Lew__44 @VootSelect @celtics @warriors Useless handle😂Jayson Tatum Boston Celtics NBA #sportscards #sponsored https://t.co/j8Ykgy9QSF@TheHastingsZone @celtics @NBCSBoston @979ESPN @jaytatum0 @FCHWPO @NESN @ABCNetwork @espn @NBA Let’s go C’s!@StevieStacks84 YASSSSS!! Let's go Celtics @celtics $JoniMetcalfNBA Final’s Game 5 Notes:

1. The team that has more than 17 turnovers will lose tonight’s game.
2. Look for the Boston Celtics to double Steph in spots to get the ball out of his hands.
3. The GS Warriors must guard the corner 3.
4. The team with a RBs margin of plus 7 will win.@GoldinCo @LaytonLussier @KenGoldin @jaytatum0 @StephenCurry30 @PaniniAmerica @Topps @beckettcollect @warriors @celtics @NBA Warriors 113 Celtics 90@SonOfSamp35 double dog dare ya @celticsBiking until Jayson and Jaylen combine for 50 points tonight.

Example: the series is tied but all you hear is shit abt Draymond and Klay and Poole (to some degree) not playing well. Who is not playing well on Boston? I think ESPN panders to an East Coast preference.

Celtics defense scares everyone, picking the Celtics doesn't make someone a Dubs hater. I disagree with JJ but respectMust have heard 5 #celtics players say they have their “backs against the wall”. 

And that’s when they play their best. 

Can they stop saying it, and DO it?

It’s making me incredibly nervous.

N'oublie ❤️, follow and retweetThe major factor in who wins Game 5 of the #NBAFinals is not whether the Boston Celtics can contain Steph Curry, but rather if the C's can limit their turnovers! 

Excess TOs mean less attempts at the basket &amp; often results in easy baskets for GSW!

Still,
I got Boston by 3🤷🏾‍♂️ https://t.co/AhzrM88GXb@OfficialNBARefs @celtics @warriors @ABCNetwork @NBA @NBAOfficial should pick the ref from @FIBAWC 'cause those ref is too fcking good that floppers players can't do anything.

The Boston Celtics have a chance to not only beat the Warriors but also send that fraud Tony Brothers to the shadow realm. BIBn like I’ve never BIB’d tonight. Would appreciate everyone responding with Celtics GIF’s today. Love all y’all@celtics They only have 3 people shootin. Forget Dray &amp; Looney. They dont shoot that much. So that only means you have to guard Curry, Thompson, Wiggins/Poole. If its 10sec &amp; counting, harass Curry but avoid fouls. That was Lebron's strategy when they were against em. &amp; Theyve succeeded.@celtics (2-2)-@warriors (2-2)

#DubNation https://t.co/4Lbk8CCgj5Let’s do it tonight!!! Let’s go @celtics. #NBA #BOSvsGSW@NBA @celtics just pass the ball 😅😅😅@celtics if JB in the half court spreads the floor and uses no pick at top. He’ll leave anyone in front and force the double in the paint that would lead to the lob to Rob and or out to the open shooter. But that’s why no pick and roll on top is huge. He can leave any defender@RedSox the @celtics won last time you tweeted at me. so i’m going to need that luck again☘️Great!!! @celtics choke game 4 &amp; as a reward you get @tonybrothers45 officiating a crucial #Game5@celtics @NBCSCeltics I need someone to run through the illegal screens tonight one good time and when the refs call tell them to stop letting them move thenBrotherhood Playoff Watch: Jayson Tatum And The Boston Celtics Have A Huge Game Monday Night #Boston #TeamCeltics #Celtics #CelticsTalk https://t.co/Ym0GIiMhFl⭐️PLAY OF THE DAY 10U ⭐️

Tatum: I never said I was a superstar
Tatum: we actually play better on the road
Coach: This team is not intelligent enough to play offense my way, that's why we're losing! 🤔Boston Celtics legend Paul Pierce owes a poker home game host $180,000, according to a lawsuit filed, but is allegedly refusing to pay it back.

https://t.co/DXajPLEPJn@PayDCost2BonTop @celtics They lost that game because they see Tatum as the superstar. Play through brown they would have won game 4. I think they can win game 7. We seen it with Dallas and phoenix and GS at home to cavs.@celtics You have to force Steph to go left @smart_MS3. He shoots from his right pocket. If you hang on his right hand, it will make it tougher for him to get the right extension on his shot. Force him left and let him drive, but always keep your focus on his pocket shot 👍🏽@beecee4077 @celtics A hypothetical! Love it. Blame the refs next.
