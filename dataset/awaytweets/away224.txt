Washington has been a surprise as they sit atop the East. Miami is only 0.5 games behind but could be without Bam Adebayo in this oneWhat's interesting about the Washington Wizards getting off to an East best 10-4 start is they've done it with Bradley Beal really struggling. 23.4 PPG, 41.1 FG, 28.0 3P.

Tommy Sheppard basically replaced Russell Westbrook with Montrezl Harrell, KCP and Spencer DinwiddieAnyone selling or giving away and kind of washington wizards cards they dont want?

Keep the winning going into the playoffs.The Nets hold the tiebreaker with Washington, but the Wizards are currently ahead due to win percentage.The Wizards in Washington never make the same mistake twice. Whether it's war in the middle east, war on poverty, war on drugs, or their insidious inflation inducing interventions in the economy, they make the same mistakes over and over again. #buildinganempire #BuildBackBetterOn the plus side, Wizards are 3rd-worst in sending opponents to the free-throw line
