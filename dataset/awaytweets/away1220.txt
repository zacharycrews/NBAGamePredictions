So yes, yes I am. An unusual and odd feeling,  but very good.@BlueJays @MapleLeafs Imagine if the Leafs, Raptors and Blue Jays all win a championship this year. That would be the greatest year in Toronto sports history.@BlueJays @MapleLeafs Jays and raptors run Toronto not the maple laughsTuesday, April 5th: X - Toronto #Raptors 

Friday, April 8th: #BlueJays come back from 0-7 to win Season Opener.

Saturday, April 9th: X - Toronto Maple #Leafs.

I'd say Toronto Sports looking pretty damn good right now.

KEEP THE GOOD TIMES ROLLIN'!

#LeafsForever #NextLevel@HCH2487 @Thomas_Ember @GorTweets @Raptors @ScottBarnes561 Cade has a higher usage rate and plays guard so he‚Äôs got better offensive production.

They‚Äôre for this season.
