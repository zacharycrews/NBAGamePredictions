Would be cool though.As reported by Jordan Schultz, the NBA is preparing for a massive story accusing Suns owner Robert Sarver of racism, sexism, and sexual harassment in a series of incidents. There’s a real chance the league would forcibly remove Sarver. 

#robertsarver #phoenixsuns #nba https://t.co/cYPNT0RpLB@CrashGladys @Suns Loads more? Sounds like all he gave these poor  ladies was loads. Sorry Crash… I just had to go there.Phoenix Suns ownership might be in trouble. 

#NBAHe’s like an anchor holding back a ship, it’s time to ditch Sarver. Been hard times since Jerry Colangelo sold the team to Sarver.

“None of what’s been said describes the Robert Sarver I know, respect and like – it just doesn’t.”NBA set to remove Robert Sarver as Phoenix Suns owner over alleged racisim, sexism, and sexual harassment claims https://t.co/01NdxuqsmTThe long awaited day of @Suns liberation is nigh! #SellTheSuns #WorstOwnerInSports #ByeSarver https://t.co/pg7oFwRsThThe @suns just released a statement. 

@FOX10Phoenix #Suns https://t.co/jwhf5WmlaoPhoenix Suns have released a statement on the story in the process of being reported on Robert Sarver. They are calling these "baseless claims."

We know well done is better than well saidI'm hearing that @LarryFitzgerald knew the Sarver story was coming, and stepped away from football to focus on putting together partners for a "competitive offer" that gives him majority ownership of the @Suns.

And by hearing, I mean I just made it up.@TrevyG82 @Suns That’s a scoop!!!

We regret to inform you the Phoenix Suns are owned by a racist https://t.co/UVhGjoUFRoThat Phoenix Suns story is a ticking timebomb. He had to have had accomplices that will also be named.@slimmduck @Wainright24 @Suns Canadians are seriously the nicest people on the planet. ❤️💯If Robert Sarver is removed as owner of the Phoenix Suns by the NBA, you have to wonder if minority owner and Arizona Cardinals legend Larry Fitzgerald would temporarily step in to a bigger role.Yeah not to take away from the authenticity of this upcoming story, but this feels like pretty coincidental timing.

Sounds like someone from Suns management wants to ensure Ayton stays in Phoenix. https://t.co/WK3QDpNYNY@TheRealSwoll1 @aldinjackson_ He’s retired lol … he does own a piece of the Phoenix Suns now@Suns you good? https://t.co/VMRb23UF9RPhoenix Suns ml 2 million fading Lebron.How many points does Devin Booker drop tonight?
