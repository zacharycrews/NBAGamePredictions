@VivekDown the 99 Today;
@AHLHeat vs @RoadrunnersAHL 5:30 PM
@SacramentoKings vs @Lakers 7:30 PM@SacramentoKings have the 2nd highest Opponent PPG in the Western Conference. (113.7ppg)

(the team with the highest is HOU, the worst team in the  West)

Same stat the Kings  led the league in last year.

This team plays shitty defense .Is fading the L.A. Lakers still the right strategy for our NBA picks? Maybe not this Tuesday when the Sacramento Kings come to town. 👇👇👇

Sacramento Kings +6.5 @ 1.95@angelssharks Cries in Sacramento Kings fan@KangzDraft Because it’s small market Sacramento.  Luckily Monte doesn’t seem that interested in what local media thinks.  Fox doesn’t have to be traded this season.  Kings have never stuck with the youth movement.  Keep collecting young talent.  I’d trade vets HB, Buddy, Holmes, Harkless.Sorry for the late post.

Caring about his son’s future should ALWAYS come first. Wins and losses can come and go. But, the two of them ever being on the same NBA court is a forever feeling between father and son…and I’m not even a LeBron fan.@DesWtf Yep and 20+ppg scorers in their prime locked into a contract on the Kings?

No, the roster isn’t balanced. But the primary issue is their lack of damn good basketball players.

Small-Ball with Lebron James at Center works against CUPCAKE TEAMS like the Sacramento Kings in the win column.@202natt Sacramento Kings@LakersSupply @BroadoaksFenwo1 @mcten Russell Westbrook and Lebron James are 2 parts of that high priced Big-3. 😂😂😂 That should be enough to beat the bottom feeder Sacramento Kings, last season’s worst ranked defense in the NBA. Lakers have 6’8 Trevor Ariza as a Big wing defender.Honestly if the NBA expands to 32 teams:

Las Vegas team is more than guaranteed, team name would either be the Venom, or Dealers.

Or it would be the former Sacramento team becoming the Las Vegas Kings.De’Aaron Fox scored 11 of his 24 points over the final six minutes, including two free throws with 6.2 seconds left, and the Sacramento Kings ended the Miami Heat’s five-game winning streak with a 115-113 victory. https://t.co/AlXxuaozaS@vichvghes nvm he on the sacramento kings now@MegaZane5 Sacramento Kings@AnpanMorie @TyHaliburton22 @SacramentoKings @CryptoMories This is fantastic! @ChazVer2c, here's your gateway NFT.@knxghtdzn @SacramentoKings @swipathefox @NBAUK GoatThe one time the whole nation wants to talk about a Sacramento Kings player and it has nothing to do with basketball.Add the Cleveland Browns with the Sacramento Kings as teams to never win a championship in my lifetime #guaranteeNBA Basketball Game Betting Picks Simulator: 1/4/2022 10:30 PM ET - Sacramento Kings vs. Los Angeles Lakers - YOU CAN RUN THE GAME SIMULATION FOR FREE HERE: https://t.co/2DATZkcX8c #nba #sportsbetting #freepicks #cappertekSacramento Kings fans should do this too https://t.co/PrPS2TGcQEThe Sacramento Kings have a very strange problem that's happening.. 🧐
