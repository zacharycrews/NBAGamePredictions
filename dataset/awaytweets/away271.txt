This is by far the most released at once so good deals long term IMO.
Injuries/poor player performance and overall market performance can still drive the price lower, but I don't see supply distribution as an issue.@Raptors Death taxes and JV hitting the 3@Raptors It's still JV threes https://t.co/8UHtUAN6Oj@Cru33 @TheMustacheTV @Raptors Last time I went was Pacers vs Raps!@Raptors And Scottie Barnes ROY*@Raptors Raps run the league@Raptors ily raps@Raptors Facts!@Raptors @wacchi1013 My man 👍👍👍👍3 guarantee in life

Toronto gets 2 for the price of 1, becoming a better shooting team and taking a chance on Bagley as a backup big, while solving their crowded talented frontcourt.

#Betting #FreePicks https://t.co/RxA2gPtS4m@stackzzz123 @nuggetsfan1501 @RyanNuggs @WorldWideWob @Raptors Then your raptors would get lit up defensively and become a black hole on offense. Bol has all the skill in the world, he just lacks the effort and discipline to earn NBA minutes right now.@nuggetsfan1501 @RyanNuggs @WorldWideWob @Raptors He just needs a fresh start with a team that will give him a chance 🤷🏾‍♂️@stackzzz123 @RyanNuggs @WorldWideWob @Raptors You guys are thin at center, someone has to play there. Bol despite being 7'2 is not a center though, you need to play him with at least one other big. He's still 30+ pounds lighter than basically any other big so he can't rebound for shit.@MavsLad @Raptors Give us something for him@nuggetsfan1501 @RyanNuggs @WorldWideWob @Raptors Yes, precious achewa on my team does nothing and he still gets minutes@stackzzz123 @RyanNuggs @WorldWideWob @Raptors Malone is a bad coach for making a player earn his minutes?
