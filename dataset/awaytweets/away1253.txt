Did you not read fresno’s study????@ILove_theArts @memgrizz He’s been doing it all year, he hasn’t intentionally tried to hurt anyone. That’s wild soft assumption. 
You guys are a great team, in this position for a reason. Enjoy it! Im done going back and forth. ✌🏽🤝@The_DocHolliday @ShannonSharpe @memgrizz @JaMorant @AnthonyMem10 That was awesome! https://t.co/EIficDpFGP@AChengey_MN @DaRealSkeet @TheHoopSchool @BleacherReport @JaMorant @memgrizz Hey Alex I agree it’s not an M for Memphis….. fuck nigga 😂@ESPNNBA @memgrizz Never seen someone so proud to blow home Kurt advantage@ILove_theArts @memgrizz You’re clearly bias, rightfully so. grizzles are your team but you’re delusional to say there hasn’t been a large amount of tickytack fouls called against the wolves. 
Are you saying Kat is a dirty player? 😂 no, he just has a kink for getting into foul trouble.@StakeReloads @memgrizz @Stake Stake username: Frixjohn1

❤️@StakeReloads @memgrizz @Stake Doneee! Stake: okanx https://t.co/8pgJ9YoEgQ@memgrizz @1Tyus Bulldog power!@CousinJahh @memgrizz You look at the free throws attempted or made. Look at when the foul call was made, against who, and while you're looking, look at the missed calls and if that missed call led to points on the board. Here's KAT again. Saturday was even worse. https://t.co/rWF3qnpfjO@StakeReloads @memgrizz @Stake My stake username: okanx https://t.co/JLcsGFJt4n@Unduhcover I've never seen KD getting locked up by this since he played against the Memphis Grizzlies 😳 in 2013@memgrizz @JaMorant I’m from Dallas and support the Mavericks all day but there’s no denying how great and mesmerizing of a player Ja Morant is. Saw him play the Mavericks in person in 2020 and have been a fan ever since.2019-2020 Chronicles Playbook Ja Morant Rookie #168 Memphis Grizzlies RC - https://t.co/lV5SHfSO7N

It’s a song, in a very popular movie. Terrance Howard was nominated for an Oscar, and Three 6 Mafia won won for Best Original song. You’re just getting offended tbh@memgrizz @Timberwolves Whole Foods grocery bags? 🥕@stephanip96 I40, only 3 hour drive to go to games (or 45 minute flight), Tennessee connection, and certainly @memgrizz can give away some swag for the official #1 Titans fan. https://t.co/naSXI9gC6s“Ain’t No Running in The M” Memphis Grizzlies Tie Up Series

The whole soundtrack for the movie was fire. One song won an OSCAR. 

It’s 2022 man, do you think rap is corrupting the youth? Lmfaoooo@ESPNNBA @memgrizz This is good for the series. Gonna watch game 3 cuz of thisBig Memphis shit! @memgrizz in 5! https://t.co/AAgOKpP3kH@CousinJahh @memgrizz Nothing debatable about it. The officiating has been horrible, but it was never in favor of the Grizzlies. KAT should've been expelled from the game for this. 
I just look forward to watching the Grizzlies play. https://t.co/RZUfpCW64a@memgrizz @Verizon @dillonbrooks24 Leader.@BleacherReport @JaMorant @memgrizz @nba playoffs feel different this year! https://t.co/BniQ0bvmQKHad a great time cheering on @JaMorant and  @memgrizz last night! https://t.co/JdUANxd8No@memgrizz @Timberwolves Grizzlies in 5foggy weather. good vibes.

#GriddysOut@CousinJahh @memgrizz I agree. It was more balanced last night than it was Saturday. Saturday, the missed calls were just as ridiculous as the ticky tack calls that were called.Imagine going back in time 5 years and telling NBA fans that Pat Bev would be catching strays from the Memphis Grizzlies https://t.co/dDq7SstFMD@MavsDepressed @BleacherReport @JaMorant @memgrizz Ja would lay luka out in a second that’s the difference@ESPNNBA @memgrizz Win the series lol@ILove_theArts @ClutchPointsApp @NBAMemes @memgrizz He can be a prick for all I care your right@uman94 @Akron_Ohio_Kid @ClutchPointsApp @NBAMemes @memgrizz Ja should be who he is.

He copied his entire game, but was worse in every measurable metric.For real @memgrizz https://t.co/6mqWetNARa@StakeReloads @memgrizz @Stake JohnJohn2626@ILove_theArts @memgrizz Should be balanced and not one sided, so it doesn’t decide games early and players can actually play their game.@CousinJahh @memgrizz So only the Timberwolves should get the whistle?@AEh_46 @ShannonSharpe @Timberwolves @memgrizz @JaMorant @IsaacBruce80 They're going to learn to keep Memphis out of their mouths!@memgrizz @jarenjacksonjr @JaMorant dance before Tuesday nights playoff game against the Timberwolves https://t.co/0onwE7WybASomebody should check Tony Brothers record against the @memgrizz https://t.co/YuJLkaJz4Z🌬️ Largest Money Line Drifts for April 20
