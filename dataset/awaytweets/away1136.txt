Coming to the end of a season both teams would rather forget. Orlando owns the worst record in the conference while Washington is almost out of mathematical play-in contention. Despite the lack of Wendell Carter, I like the points here.

Magic are tanking and FD now has the line at -3. I don’t see why the Wizards don’t cover this especially with Orlando’s weird rotations and sitting star players in the 4th.

Cade is probably better than Franz but I don’t know. The Magic should have given the ball to Franz and they didn’t. Fultz is better as well. Orlando is a piece and health away.@OrlandoMagic @admiralelite15 Happy Birthday!!! 🍊🍊🍊@joelvmoran He’s been commenting on Orlando Magic posts… we desperately need a go to scorer and we have assets… I’m just sayin@OrlandoMagic @TheRealMoBamba @orlmagichistory @CCDistillery @Magic_PR @ORLmuse Come to DetroitSometimes fans and writers forget that pro sports are more than just a sport and @Gourmetcasanova tells @OrlandoMagic fans to remember that this is a business as well. #MagicTogether #NBA #Basketball #Business

https://t.co/FVoDjgSREV@BruceHa86541108 @DWUhlfelderLaw Oh I beg to differ we will continue to go to Florida just not Disney. I've already canceled a cruise for 8 aboard  Disney Dream and a week stay in Orlando. Makes me wonder what really going on in the MAGIC CASTLE.@mtplug_grinder Probably still better than being an orlando magic fan lmaoSo… I’m good. If I’m in Orlando on business, will I ask a friend for a comp? Maybe (if they’re even valid), but I’m not rushing to go back. The parks are in a sorry state. It’s not fun. The value is gone. The magic is still there, but it has lessened.

He has still put together some 20 point games, but it appears to me he might need a night off to get his legs under him.

While he will be a free agent and will negotiate with New York, the Boston Celtics, and Orlando Magic would be suitors for Jefferson's services.@BladeCunningham @InStanWeTrust04 @BobbyMarks42 @SIChrisMannix I mean Franz just put PG13 year 3 numbers as a rookie…I mean if you don’t think so that’s fine, but the Magic kept his usage low because he was too good. And yes orlando is ahead of Detroit they have more good players. And they probably draft top 3 or 4, so they will get The Guy@theozonepod Magic's chances next season R good; element of unselfish play from Cole &amp; Markelle will lead this team in a great way @The_ColeAnthony @MarkelleF Finish off season strong but HEALTHY.
