The problem is Westbrook.@AfterHoursCBS @ALawRadio It is ironic how Michael Jordan almost became a Houston Rocket in 1984. Hakeem "The Dream" Olajuwon admitted as much.

What a guy. https://t.co/uLwJL1XJYrThe Rockets are reportedly open to an eventual reunion with James Harden, though not all Houston fans appear ready to welcome him back.  https://t.co/QYz3AmUKVWI don't know what changed with James Harden since he left Houston. He can still be the dominant force he was with the #Rockets on certain nights, but he used to be THAT dude night in and night out. It's weird to see.
