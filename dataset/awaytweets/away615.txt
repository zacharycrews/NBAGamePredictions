Both of those games were second games of back-to-backs.

Brooklyn enters Chicago with a league-best road record (14-4) and haven‚Äôt lost two road games in the same month yet.

The Brooklyn nets are not obligated to pay the fine so that Kyrie can get paid his 17 million. Kyrie has made a choice to not get vaccinated and the Nets made a choice to not pay these fines.@BrooklynNets @newyorklottery With that small fine amount of about 100k,  Nets organization should pay that so Kyrie can play home games. It would cost a lot more to go out and sign a player who is not on Kyrie‚Äôs level@BrooklynNets yah know what to do. https://t.co/EwGb2mDcA0Nike should pay the fine like they did for Jordan and have kyrie debut new kicks each game @Nike @KyrieIrving @BrooklynNets@TMKSESPN The backlash that would come down on city officials &amp; the @BrooklynNets about a penalty structure that impedes the average small/medium NYC business but which billion dollar sports franchises or Wall Street banks can buy their way out of would be cataclysmic!Do you fear The Beard???
