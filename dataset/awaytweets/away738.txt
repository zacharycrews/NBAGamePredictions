Does it count?@SacramentoKings join the club https://t.co/C0zXyLeQSgI don't think the @SacramentoKings should try to trade for any other players- they should just keep the ones they have. But also they should let those guys know if any of them want to leave and go to some other team, that's ok too. #SacramentoProud@SacramentoKings Neither they are both gross 🤢 they aren't real Philly cheese steaks just a tourist attraction.@SacramentoKings Jason Thompson and Corliss Williamson@SacramentoKings What about Jim's?1. @SacramentoKings You wanted Buddy Hield you have pieces to go get him and greatly increase the offensive spacing.

This is your white knight???? @SacramentoKings fans???? LOL@SacramentoKings @RealWorldsChamp where did we go..?@SacramentoKings Pats all day longThe Sacramento Kings have no longer decided to pursue Ben Simmons in trade talks.

Rumors are that the Sixers will hold onto Simmons until the off-season for a potential sign-and-trade with James Harden, Bradley Beal or another highly coveted free agent.@CamsCards12 @okcthunder @SacramentoKings Thunder 112-Kings 105@SacramentoKings Eating that tourist slop.
