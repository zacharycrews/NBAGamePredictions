Let ‘em know the next time he sees me I’m gonna hit it though, so he better bet on me.Only two people in @trailblazers gear threw a brick this bad last night - myself and @joshhart on his deep three. 

Only difference is he also scored 44 while I clapped. https://t.co/S67n5Ijz0MI officially finished my 36x48” @AnferneeSimons / @trailblazers painting and will be posting it tomorrow😎 #RipCity@trailblazers Its the Hart-Break KidTrail Blazers Game Notes: Portland Trail Blazers (26-40) vs. Atlanta Hawks (33-34): PORTLAND TRAIL BLAZERS (26-40) AT ATLANTA HAWKS (33-34) https://t.co/WMmNhnzRuw #RipCity https://t.co/QSxE4FWWphTrail Blazers Game Notes: Portland Trail Blazers (26-40) vs. Atlanta Hawks (33-34) https://t.co/s7YA2dLkWL https://t.co/58P5WPDZ5m@TomJackmanWP Hahaha.

Even though Trae Young scored 47 points, Atlanta failed to play consistent defense down the stretch. Tomorrow night, the boys face the Portland Trail Blazers at 7:30pm! 

#TrueToAtlanta #TheAtlantaVoice https://t.co/RWrTdTtiFE@bosnianbeast27 Yes you are. KILLED @trailblazers cap for years after “medically retiring” then choosing to come back with a different team. Now, he never comes back to Portland. Bye.@fuzzysimpleton7 @trailblazers “Hustler” is a word ruined by Larry Flynt — 👎🏽 to the porno associations. Jetpack pretty good, but it doesn’t use the great opportunity of H(e)art. Best for *sound* is “Hart Attack”, but seems like bad luck? —and 🏀 is all about superstition, so… let’s
keep 💭🧠🛠🪚🔮🪛⚙️ 💭ing!@bosnianbeast27 @joshhart @trailblazers Consider Hartbreak. Hear me out: it’s a portmanteau of his name and fastbreak, but is also a homonym. It can be a gerund used in-game when he’s pushing pace too. It’s flexible, easy to remember, unique and rolls off the tongue. Branding opportunities abound.@BleacherReport @joshhart @trailblazers Fucked up man@NBATV @joshhart @trailblazers 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 gamer stuffIt’s not done yet, but it’s getting close😁🥳 @AnferneeSimons @trailblazers https://t.co/1kshdj7dRGwho is @trailblazers going to have playing tomorrow? 😅My dad retired this week after 44 years at the same company, doing the same job. He grew up in Oregon and loves the @trailblazers and especially @BillWalton. Picked this up and graded it, giving it to him as a retirement present tomorrow. He will cry. #thehobby https://t.co/iuSclDGEZI@trailblazers Want!!@treycorn Keegan Murray is a Portland Trail Blazer if it helps…@bosnianbeast27 @joshhart @trailblazers BraveHart https://t.co/WQPRGxxO1G
