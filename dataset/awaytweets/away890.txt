Find out why we're Dino hunting with our Raptors vs. Hornets picks.

https://t.co/ljL4yZtMuQ@Matt__Devlin @Raptors @Paul__Jones Get well soon!Toronto defeated the Minnesota Timberwolves 103-91 in their final game before the break. The victory snapped a two-game losing streak for Toronto but the Raptors have won nine of the last 11 games.💪

It's going to be hot in this match 🔥🏀NBA🏀
Charlotte Hornets vs Toronto Raptors 

Charlotte looks to snap a three-game losing streak. Charlotte was defeated by the Miami Heat 111-107 in their last game prior to the All-Star Game break. Charlotte has lost nine of its last 10 games. https://t.co/QBqOZcIYrn@Bounc5ack9800 @fymroo Most fans don’t know that KD never lead the warriors in scoring, not even 1 of his 3 years. They also don’t know that Steph lead the finals in scoring the year Toronto won with the entire Raptors focused on just him as last man standing. https://t.co/wh3tbNFCov@Matt__Devlin @Raptors @Paul__Jones Get well soon Matt!@Matt__Devlin @Raptors @Paul__Jones Hope you and your family have only the  really mild version.

Raptors got their ring and DeMar has grown exponentially as a player. Absolutely incredible to see the player he’s become. https://t.co/AKMRLqsJ3qTomorrow night @Raptors vs @ATLHawks #NBA75Tonight @Raptors vs @hornets #NBA75“and with the 9th overall pick, the Toronto Raptors select-“ https://t.co/XFCD4nI4kvWhen DeMar was in Toronto, I asked @JalenandJacoby if he was the greatest Raptor of all time.

Is your hockey team that sad that you have to refer to an MLS team. The Leafs are the worst Toronto franchise, heck give me the lacrosse team over them lmao.@dariogranic1 @Raptors Raps in 6🙌🏽🙌🏽@DeMar_DeRozan is that dude. Everyone said it was over for him when he was traded to San Antonio but now he’s back &amp; playing better ball than he did in Toronto. Top 3 MVP candidate for me. #Spurs #Bulls #RaptorsIt’s so funny to see all this DeMar praise on the tl now when he’s been doing this shit in Toronto. Shows you how much unnecessary hate the Raptors get for being the only team outside of the US.Derozan is ballin no doubt BUT…..if I’m @Raptors or @Klow7 my question is WHERE TF WAS ALL THIS WHEN LEBRON KEPT PUTTING US OUT THE PLAYOFFS 😂😂😂😂His Raptor teams really just couldn’t get past Lebron. But he’s been this. Toronto might have panicked in trading him, but since they got their ring, you can’t say it was the wrong move 🤷🏾‍♂️ https://t.co/IOmfqoI9rr@Fred_VanGoat23 @Noo0ah @Sviat_10 @Raptors They posted on it 5 hours ago bud@WorldWideWob If only he would have done this as a @Raptors they would have won a championship......@CamilleW_Media If Toronto can't make a run then would love to see him do something with Chicago. Was sad to see Toronto trade him but it got my Raptors a title so can't complain too much@Marathon_Man_G @Raptors We can run a tab, loser buys…..

So don’t forget your visa…Did the @Raptors lose the Demar Derozan trade?@RookieRocc @TheHoopCentral DeMar Darnell DeRozan is an American professional basketball player for the Chicago Bulls of the National Basketball Association. He played college basketball for the USC Trojans and was selected ninth overall by the Toronto Raptors in the 2009 NBA draft.
