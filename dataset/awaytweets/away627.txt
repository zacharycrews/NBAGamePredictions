It looks all over the place because it is, when bogi was out wing d was horrible.
So when all.players are in and healthy things look different. 

Remove iggy, and draymond and klay how@dollarbillskee @SportsTalkATL @ATLHawks @JaMorant Nah you just talkin buddy, everybody a coach somewhere. We both want to hawks to win,  you can break down any play weakness but you missin the point. If all are in their rolls and our best defenders on the court it looks diff. Seen clint and dre on court much?
Steph D looks bad..You can't plan everything.
But you can sure as hell try.

#ProHoyas #H4L #HoyaSaxa #WeAreGeorgetown #GeorgetownHoopStats https://t.co/Yh35MBXkp3@dollarbillskee @SportsTalkATL @ATLHawks @JaMorant Btw DONT MENTION THEIR UNDER .500 RECORD IN THE 1ST HALF IF YOU DONT MENTION THEIR 41-31 record last year which...
Do the math They went 25-11 to end the year so dont bring lame numbers up and not the finished product to mask a point 

Relax and try again on 2.11.22@dollarbillskee @SportsTalkATL @ATLHawks @JaMorant They were in roles they werent brought here for.
Remember we are by far the single most affected team by covid this year our record would be a lot better.

Also Dieng is better than you think, 
Delon plays defense
And TLC although streaky is still more consistent than Cam on D.@jchb87 Memphis grizzlies 30-14 
Atlanta Hawks 17-23 

That’s all that mattersFinally back home for a 5 game home stand 💪😤🔥 again vs the #AtlantaHawks tonight to make this a 4 game winning streak to get to 27-15 on the season!

I was so relieved that it was finally over.@NyFeedz99 @BaezTruther @ATLHawks @camreddish yea when cam bricks corner 3s it hits the rim, not the side of the backboard like pandemic p@NickGinzburg @ATLHawks @camreddish High school basketball team where he actually is the star.Me every time I hear a report that the Atlanta Hawks have interest in trading for Ben Simmons https://t.co/OGXOdo2O3g@Chris77572104 @BaezTruther @ATLHawks @camreddish The coaches and the other talent on the team were in Cam’s way.   Now he can reach his potential.

That was a trick.  I was talking about Duke.  Now, how do you feel?@dmcc_mccallum @Mellowfellow03 @GaCharm @ATLHawks @camreddish Dre is also 2 yrs older.  That should be factored into the comparison.@Trae11xCole15 @aadam616 @BaezTruther @ATLHawks @camreddish I hope he’s as good for them as he was for us.

Without him, they are the Atlanta Hawks.@TheyLoveMyEther Ok this is a stupid ass argument so if it needs to be said I'll say it.

Thank you @ATLHawks https://t.co/0GBDeAD6oP@MikeBellATL @ATLHawks I don’t believe there’s anything wrong with being annoyed at a team who has delivered far more below expectations, especially considering they were within a time shot of the finals, last year. 

Fans have accepted mediocrity for decades, it’s ok to want more.@rahmmagick @atlcha @ATLHawks knox has been a pretty decent 3-point shooter in his minutes this year. that’s about it tho!@MikeBellATL @ATLHawks We only win titles in this town now.

That dude y'all had on yesterday spoke nothing but facts.ICYMI: The @nyknicks traded for Cam Reddish on Thursday, acquiring him from the @ATLHawks for Kevin Knox, Solomon Hill and a 2nd round pick.

Still on euphoria ride.   Stress levels stable.  I just re-watch the Soler homerun whenever I'm feeling discouraged.@BigGameJimmy @LakerCentral365 Since the Atlanta Hawks got a 1st Round Draft Pick for a bench player, the Detroit Pistons definitely gonna demand a 1st Round Draft Pick for Jerami Grant.

Hunter is back... let's see if A) he can stay healthy, B) he can help the defense.

That said, you're right. They've got to fix things, but I don't think Cam (and Hill's contract) leaving mean much.@sitefeniseni3 @KxngLenny_ @GrimyGoblin @BaezTruther @ATLHawks @camreddish Yeah instead you have Julius Randle@MikeBellATL @ATLHawks I think we're all just pissed we chose TLC over Cam to start and value Cam less than TLC, Gallo and Bogi.@MikeBellATL @ATLHawks 🤣

I trust Travis.

Im not worried at all.

First warning@dmcc_mccallum @GaCharm @ATLHawks @camreddish The team made it to the conference finals without Dre or Cam. Dre is about to get that contract that they couldn't give Cam also. I think Dre is the better rebounder, 3 point shooter and rim defender. Cam plays isolation ball and he needed more minutes. Travis is cooking https://t.co/OaWAP0GEzmTrae Young Atlanta Hawks

Smh #hawks #atlanta https://t.co/FUTFYiCsddAll it took was a heavily protected first round pick to acquire a young, talented wing in @camreddish.

Hard to believe that’s the best the @ATLHawks can get for him. 

@nyknicks got a steal assuming he develops further and they extend the former Dukie.

 https://t.co/ZYXr9VN3J6@ByTimReynolds @ATLHawks  players would be standing crying to the ref instead of getting back on defense@ATLHawks @camreddish Hawks are idiots for not giving Cam a bigger role in the team. He’s better than Bogdanovic and Huerter@ColemanBandits @RecruitGAHoops @DeionSanders @ATLHawks that was the smoothest thing i’ve ever seen@ATLHawks Could yall not atleast have gotten someone who can score atleast 15 once. Maybe like a rj barett. Or an kimba or fournia@atlcha @ATLHawks He averaged 3.6/.2/1@tjhook47 @YungPancakes @ATLHawks Dre starting job is locked. Cam wasn't even starting over TLC.

https://t.co/J23ABaH07qThe @ATLHawks don’t know WHAT they doing. The roster needs retooling but don’t move the young potential for other guys not producing! Hopefully that first round pick amounts to something. 🙄🤦🏽‍♂️😒@Happyknicksfan1 @ATLHawks Over RJ?

We traded Solomon Hill for Knox.. lolAtlanta Hawks fans that are rueing the trade of Cam Reddish to the New York Knicks, I have a message for you: you're uneducated about this young man.

The reason you wound up with him is because he slid in the 2019 NBA Draft.

He was tanking as early as your selection of him.@terrellbarron16 @BigMoneyATL @ATLHawks I don't know if Cam is going to be a star but I do know Kevin Knox is not.@HingleMingle69 @ATLHawks We watched first hand that Ben Simmons can't come through in the clutch.

Good Luck #22 @ATLHawks@Eypharseit @terrellbarron16 @ATLHawks Because I’m not trading Capela +Okongwu and then having to do Collins, Hunter+ more all for Simmons on a max contract, blowing up the team for Simmons? He’s not that guy@Eypharseit @ATLHawks Yeah again you’re a causal…it’s literally common sense. Two guys shooting 40% from the line isn’t working in the playoffs. Both would get hacked and taken off the court. That’s why you have no rebuttal. Also no nba analyst said hawks need Simmons to pair with Capela.Nate McMillan said last season the @NBA wanted the @nyknicks in the playoffs.

The Knicks on the other hand haven’t even won a playoff since 2013.
