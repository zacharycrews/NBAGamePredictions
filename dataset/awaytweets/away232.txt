Association vs. Icon https://t.co/V5YRabflk7Congrats to @steelemagic for being named one of the best NBA announcers of all time. It is REALLY cool to have the same announcer for the entire history of a franchise. This is something -  I think @JTurnerMagic  would agree it should get a bell. #orlandomagicAmway Center (Orlando Magic)

Gross. Named after a pyramid scheme (which is owned by the same family that owns the team).

@patrickc &amp; @collision need to buy the Orlando Magic and call the venue the Stripe Center (an homage to the team's wonderful pinstripe uniforms). https://t.co/rzTDL1HdY8Brooklyn Nets - Orlando Magic
