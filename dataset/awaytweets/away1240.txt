 #playoftheday #nbaplayoffs #nftcommunity #nfts https://t.co/1dEuVhQ0QDMiami Heat v. Atlanta Hawks Preview

Clint Capela's injury will make-or-break Atlanta's chances. The Heat need to manufacture floor spacing or else the Hawks can outscore them. A closer matchup than seeding indicates

Prediction: Heat in 7 https://t.co/tysVXi7VG7Miami scored their most points per-possession against the Hawks this season

Miami averages 1.14 points per possession but against the Atlanta Hawks that number grew to 1.22

Teams that play drop coverage on defense (Hawks and Bulls), the Miami Heat tend to feast on https://t.co/cfLEIgnHAvNot sure why everyone thinks Miami Heat will beat Atlanta Hawks easily. Maybe I'm missing something.Me is risen… With a hangover… But because I’m a devout Irish Catholic, I will go get hair of the dog at Easter service 🍷… By Easter service I mean brunch at @StansBlueNote to watch the @ATLHawks #NBAPlayoffs https://t.co/9XaQkS3725@ATLHawks Go Jesus and go Hawks!!Atlanta Hawks John Collins will play in Game 1 vs the Miami Heat today, barring issues in warmups.
