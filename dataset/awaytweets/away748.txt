#TakeNote #NBA #NBATwitter #NBA75@BensHoops @utahjazz Good luck Alex.  You can’t go down much further that’s the good news.@tribjazz That’s it. He’s now the Utah Jazz coach in my heart.Tonight's starting lineup for the Utah Jazz: Conley, Ingles, Bogdanovic, O’Neale, Whiteside https://t.co/bVWH4AMCA2@TheHoopCentral In nba terms what just happen was basically the Utah jazz beating the warriors in the western conference finals or the Cleveland cavaliers beating the Brooklyn nets in the eastern conference finalsDanuel House Jr. being in health and safety protocol probably means we won't see him again in a @utahjazz uniform on his 10-day deal. 

If we see him again it likely means he's been signed to a regular deal. 

#takenote | @kslsports@TheFazMan94 It's different when you've already seen your team win it all. I can quickly shift over to the Utah Jazz without any grievance.

As for coaching, Quin isn't the first Jazz coach who might be excellent in many ways but have fundamental flaws obvious to others
