I‚Äôve seen fans say an assortment of the three.@QuibbyC @TheAthleticNBA @KellyIkoNBA @HoustonRockets @JalenGreen Y‚Äôall can keep saying that.. but what‚Äôs that really matter.. does Denver? Does Boston? If Al P is as good as we think he can be we don‚Äôt necessarily need a ‚ÄúPG‚Äù by your terms between kpj, JG and Al P it could work@ProdiGNBA @TheAthleticNBA @britrobotista @KellyIkoNBA @HoustonRockets @JalenGreen He won‚Äôt get no crazy extension if he don‚Äôt do better but no doubt they will extend him if things continue gettin better.. and I think down the line when Sengun starts a lot of playmaking won‚Äôt be all on him and I bet it moves more to Al P@coletrain_tnt @JordanVsDream LoL, this should be familiar material to Rockets fans by now. Those of us who have spent a lot of time watching the whole NBA and it‚Äôs coverage know there‚Äôs a strange bias that is used when national folks talk about Houston. Reggie Miller, anyone? üòÇ#Rockets have failed to cover the spread in 13 of their last 14 games when playing as underdogs. Houston is the underdog given a 52.4% chance to cover a +5.5-point spread against #PorVida

He had the Clippers on the map as a playoff team. He took Duncan/Ginobli/Parker Spurs to 7 games in 2008 2nd round when he was clearly outmatched in talent. When he went to Houston, Harden won his MVP &amp; the Rockets had the #1 seed.Ugh. My @spurs are playing the Rockets here in Houston on the 25th... But I have a soccer game that night... 

I don't like missing games, but the way @DejounteMurray is playing this year, I may need to make that sacrifice...@parzival2l We played two teams who specialise in rim protection over wing defence.

Who would get a starting job on another team. With a winning record. Not a lost franchise like Houston is at the moment. But a winning team. Who would get the green light?. I‚Äôm going with nobody.
