Out of that List, Barrett is the only proven NBA starter.  The other guys are developing but nobody has proven anything yet.

this knicks season is OVER thanks to julius randle and tom thibodeau's poor examples of leadership@BroKnows368 @Sjkeepitreal @nyknicks so bringing back bzdelik was just a cover up to prevent the blame from being on harden? cuz until you brought the facts, i thought it was a combo of danPHONY, bzdelik and morey's analytics@BroKnows368 @illTawil @nyknicks I see Harden to Sixers for Simmons on the real though...@nyknicks make a trade bozo@JQuasto According to @stephenasmith‚Ä¶ if @Dame_Lillard is to leave Portland‚Ä¶ the only place he wants to play is with @nyknicks ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è@NBAonTNT @TheRealJRSmith @nyknicks @cavs @Lakers @nuggets @ncatsuaggies @NBA His inside the park home run in the celebrity all star game in Cleveland.

That‚Äôs literally the dumbest shit I‚Äôve ever heard in my life, it‚Äôs 6 fucking players obviously there gonna score more all combined@itschyll @hhpthebook @nyknicks I was stating he is most impactful off the bench.  This off-season was a disaster.  Start the young guys after trading who you can. We may be able to develop one of our own PG. Grab a higher draft pick.  Work with randle on leadership.

Give em Kemba and picks, give Thibs as a kicker in the deal.@Metr0_76 @LindorHOF @nyknicks What‚Äôs redundant is when Rj gets it going randle has to suddenly run the offense. It happens every time.
