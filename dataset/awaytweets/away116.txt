Hornets defensively tho...@DrJoeReed @hornets Where is your CNN interview DoctorOkoro, Lauri, Love out is going to make this game a major challenge for Cleveland.

The Wade minutes were rough against Charlotte the other night. I think Portland is a better matchup for him (Cov, Nance aren't going to drive/face-up as much as the Hornets PFs did), but still.@DrJoeReed @hornets Stop your fucking lying dudeIf they switch to commentary, it will make me buy ALL of the @hornets moments for Eric Collins alone.
