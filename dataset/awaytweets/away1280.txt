1u - Golden State Warriors ML (-130 DK)

GSW’s lineup offers too much shooting and scoring for MEM to keep up, and GP2 is better suited to guard Ja than anyone in the league.

They’re rested, Grizz on a quick turn around from Friday.

Warriors are the best team in the playoffs thus far. I think Dubs win the series and Gm 1. Grizzlies were able to erase big leads vs an inexperienced T-Wolves team. That won’t be the case vs Golden State. #GamblingTwiitter https://t.co/I3cVzg8Vap🔴𝐖𝐚𝐭𝐜𝐡 𝐋𝐢𝐯𝐞📺 @sportsnmore247

We are eliminating them time to revenge5/1/94 – Behind KJ's career playoff-high 38p with 4r/9a, the Phoenix #Suns used a 10-2 run to open the 4Q and roll over the Golden State Warriors 117-111 to take a 2-0 lead in the First Round. Barkley: 20p/7r/8a. Rookie Chris Webber: 17p/10r/9a.

But let me just say, our Lack of a athletic big man will continue to be exploited as we enter this next round &amp; if we advance

Wish we had Wiseman; but even without, LFG!!! #GoldBloodedAfter one round of the #NBAPlayoffs it seems like the Boston Celtics and Golden State Warriors are on a collision course to meet in the 2022 #NBAFinals but as well all know, everything can change in a fraction of a second! #NBATwitterMy prediction with the current roster to date

Boston 4 - 1 bucks
Miami 4 - 1 Sixers
Memphis 4 - 3 golden state warriors
Suns 4 - 1 Dallas@warriors in 6! Let's start with a bang!Excited to watch @JaMorant but really looking forward to @Bucks v. @warriors Finals. 🏆

Lines crossing would mean the ratio of offensive rating to defensive rating for each series would need to be the same. Again, not that likely but I guess I understand your point?Memphis vs Golden State

Grizzles played them tough this year and beat them in the play in. Not the same Warriors team but that doesn’t mean the Grizzles confidence or belief will be any different

Zero rest excuse 7 months down the line doesn’t hold up, especially when they had, what, 3 weeks less?
2. Know where you are on the court and don’t go 0-6 in OT
3. Can only play the team in front of you. Also they beat the sixers.
4. CP3 played every game + Giannis was hurt

Fucking clown 🤡 let's see what you guys do vs. Boston 🤡Golden State Warriors guard Jordan Poole’s rapid rise from G Leaguer to NBA difference-maker has offered a blueprint to anyone who toils in a lesser league hoping to carve out a niche at the highest level. https://t.co/glfzI3vCpu@NBA @warriors Steph             Ja
Poole              Bane
Klay                Brooks
Wiggins          Clarke
Draymond      Jackson

The closing lineups that will decide this series, Griz won 3 of 4 reg season, but one of Klay, Steph or Draymond was out in all 4 of those games.  

Dubs in 6@HakaTime99 @NoNotReo @warriors @memgrizz You got it buck.The biggest defensive issue for the Grizzlies against Golden State is who Ja’s matchup will be. Against Minnesota, Memphis hid him on Beverley. Against the Warriors, there aren’t too many places to hide him with Curry, Klay, Poole, and Wiggins.

1. Heat with zero rest after finals run the year before 
2. The nets without kyrie (took 7 games and 1/2 shoe size to big for KD to win)
3. A bad lucky hawks team
4. A suns team with no CP3 or a hurt CP3 team
Bucks are the worst champion ever 🤡🤡@Aniket_Mohan24 @damanr Jimmy Butler told us many years ago about Big KAT's heart many years ago. D-Lo on the Golden State Warriors team, but trying his hardest to become teammates with Big KAT, that's not about winning that's about best friends hanging out.Yes, the Golden State Warriors wouldn't be the team they are now if wasn't for this man https://t.co/PCK8XS2kHG@KinJAMESLebron @Shichihu @StephenCurryA @Temiloluwa_23 @warriors @Oracle Your only likes are your own tweets@DogSurfRoadshow @warriors Lol Mr Freeze was a tough sell 😂😂@warriors @memgrizz Warriors fans cocky but you gonna find out about Memphis real soon!!!

-Deepest squad in the nba
-Younger
-More athletic
-1 - 4 incl playin last year
-Hometown advantage
-You dont even have the best shooter in this series (Bane)

Lets go Grizz!!!@warriors Y'all better not lose this seriesBreaking: The Cavaliers are trading Joel Embiid to the Golden State Warriors for Finals MVP Kawhi Leonard.@peteredmiston @SainAsylum I’m watching film. The @warriors won’t put pressure on us at the 4 and 5 spot like Kat &amp; McDaniels did. Especially at the basket. @jarenjacksonjr will definitely need to take full advantage. Because that’s what he’ll have down low an advantage.@theo78 @CignalTV for @celtics vs @Bucks, @OneSportsPHL delayed for @warriors vs @memgrizz.@Neil_Hess122 @NoNotReo @warriors @memgrizz Theres a reason these "role players" had the 2nd best record in the NBA. Youre gonna find out real soon. Deepest squad in the league. Younger. More athletic. Youve got so many match up problems it aint funny. And all that aside you dont even have the best shooter on your team 😆Golden State Warriors | Split Screen

Great action from the GSW and Coack Kerr for Jordan Poole off their split series.

When the Warriors won, Ja Morant was returning from a knee injury and Brandon Clarke didn’t play. 

Now both squads should be at full strength.
