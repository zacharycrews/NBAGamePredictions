#„Éï„Ç©„É≠„ÉêThe #Bulls are massive dogs in tonight vs the #Bucks. That could mean a low scoring game.

Chicago has gone UNDER 7 straight games since 1/23/21 as a dog of more than 8 points.  

They have gone UNDER by an average of 26.5 ppg.!

Zach being back is up to the people controlling the @chicagobulls.
Zach's great but knee issues, max contract is too much of a risk. Zach's only 27. #Bulls may give him a contract for 2-3 years only.

https://t.co/qK8rSQUIm4@TylerIAm Also WCJ probably needed to leave Chicago for a fresh start because those Boylen years were BAD for all of the Bulls young guys@floppydisk559 @David_Potteiger @chicagobulls grown man talkin ab making excuses üòÇ us bulls fans knew even full roster we were gonna lose lmao stfu ain‚Äôt no excuses here@David_Potteiger @chicagobulls You acting as if Kris would make a difference ü§£ü§£ü§£Facing elimination, the Chicago Bulls were dealt another blow Tuesday when Zach LaVine entered health and safety protocols. https://t.co/PPss6QqejW@chicagobulls @DeMar_DeRozan @NikolaVucevic Not looking too happy about it!@chicagobulls @DeMar_DeRozan @NikolaVucevic Good luck guys! No matter what happens, finally bulls went to the playoffs.Facing elimination, the Chicago Bulls were dealt another blow Tuesday when Zach LaVine entered health and safety protocols. https://t.co/Sxs7XfUjaLNot re-signing LaVine would mean basically blowing up this edition of the Bulls because there isn't a realistic trade candidate Chicago can get. Also, they don't have a 2023 or 2025 first rounders so a rebuild really doesn't make any sense@chicagobulls @DeMar_DeRozan @NikolaVucevic Let's go Bulls.üòúüòúüòúüòúüòúüòú@chicagobulls @DeMar_DeRozan @NikolaVucevic No matter how this game goes down tomorrow this season has finally given us something worth cheering. Im hyped for next seasonJazz shooting performance last night was the 9th worst shooting performance off expected value over the last 5 years in the playoffs.  Chicago Bulls game 1 this year v. Bucks was worseWish @patbev21 was on the @chicagobulls #grinding #hustle #allHeart #toughasnails #chicagobred@RealChicagoDave @sexykels217 @KCJHoop @NBCSChicago @ZachLaVine Lavine's not what's wrong with @chicagobulls...it's a point guard league and our best PG is hurt...dudes getting 25 5 and 5 a night, not many players can say that@flawlesskash @chicagobulls @DeMar_DeRozan @NikolaVucevic I couldn‚Äôt agree more. But being a big who can protect the rim is not a hard thing to accomplish. If he takes time in the off season to work on it I see no reason why he shouldn‚Äôt stay. Especially with a gusrd like Zach if he resigns they could be a deadly duo next season.So @ZachLaVine has entered in to protocols for the 10th time ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è what the hell this boy be doin?

I'll check you later, #BillsMafia.@JasonPatt78 @K_SnG @chicagobulls @stoolpresidente Let them know! üòé@GameCoinGMEX @chicagobulls Done@MDJ2396 @Gods_Favourite_ @StarenAren @BleacherReport Grant was drafted in 87 with Pippen.
Grant was arguably better than Pippen their first 2 seasons. Grant imo was better than Rodman while both played for the Bulls. Dude seriously doesn't get enough respect for his play in Chicago.@K_SnG @JasonPatt78 @chicagobulls @stoolpresidente So much YUM@flawlesskash @chicagobulls @DeMar_DeRozan @NikolaVucevic Coby I understand but vooch? I get he hasn‚Äôt been playing his roll as a big man and more as a shooting guard but he has been the only one consistently putting up 20+ a game. Demar and Zach just didn‚Äôt perform this year in playoffs@ZachLaVine and @DeMar_DeRozan are DRIVING this bus rn. It‚Äôs up to the young guys to step up and put this team where it‚Äôs supposed to be, into next season as well. Deebo and Zach are Bulls. @NBCSBulls @chicagobulls https://t.co/w1git44EFt@JasonPatt78 @chicagobulls @stoolpresidente Cheesy on the eyes ü§§@chicagobulls @DeMar_DeRozan @NikolaVucevic Good luck fellas...you're gonna need it!@chicagobulls He could drive up from Niles or wherever he lives... eat breakfast at 9am test at 11am "gee I'm fine" get in the car and go to @FiservForum faster than a flight to MKE @icao #BullsNation #bullsin7 @Stacey21King #cookie #hotsauce@chicagobulls @DeMar_DeRozan @NikolaVucevic Felizes?Watching @MiamiHEAT play vs @ATLHawks without Butler &amp; Lowry, yet putting up a fight. @Chicagobulls had 2 so-called stars on floor in GM3, GM4 &amp; lost by 30 &amp; 24 pts. #Bulls do not have the mental tenacity to fight (ever). Except Phil, no HC has instilled that for this franchise.@ajguyton @chicagobulls I have some bad news: the Grizzlies have him under contract next year for 4mill üò¨Brandon Clarke should be starting for someone. @chicagobulls I hope you‚Äôre going to bid! #NBAPlayoffs@faintlives @KolTheCarry @flawlesskash @chicagobulls @DeMar_DeRozan @NikolaVucevic if we are talking abt old gobert I‚Äôm in but he‚Äôs not the same.

Portis is 3 years olders and had his opportunity to play at a level to be paid like JC and couldn‚Äôt in Chicago. Living in a bulls household I witnessed it. 

If portis was here he‚Äôd be a paid a lot of money anyway.@chicagobulls 33-point loss instead of 23.@kobeeeeeeeee999 @chicagobulls @DeMar_DeRozan @NikolaVucevic Very trueChicago Bulls Derrick Rose 1 Sewn Adidas Youth XL +2 https://t.co/rDlHQNrdER eBay https://t.co/l1uJlNs6pK@TselentisYianni @grangerdanger96 @GeorgeHillSan1 @nathanmarzion @chicagobulls Who‚Äôs mom/gym teacher is that?Victor Oladipo and Jaylen Brunson will be free agents after the season.
