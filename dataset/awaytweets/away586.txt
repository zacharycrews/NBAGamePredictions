THAT’S IT THAT’S ALL. ✌🏾@ATLHawks defense is a very easy fix. Which I’m positive the coaching staff a has relayed. All it really takes is talking on defense.

Trae Young still keeps his positive outlook about @ATLHawks getting to playoffs. https://t.co/Kp0hdrzU7rThe Atlanta Hawks are emerging as a suitor Philadelphia's Ben Simmons.@LakeShowYo He's not playing center.  Clint Capela is Atlanta Hawks Center.  Lebron was matched up with John Collins all night. He actually ended up guarding Bogdonavich and Cam Reddish more than ever defending "Center"   
Another BS narrative out of Narrative Kingsland. #goatsdontneedlies@Privado_AE we really have the same amount of wins and SIX more losses than the 2015 Atlanta hawks (bulls) 😹😹😹😭😭😭😭😐😐😐😐😐👍👍👍New listing!

Coach Nate gotta fix this defense. My take on the game last night #hawks #Atlanta #nba #basketball #lakers #atlantahawks@ATLHawks @TheTraeYoung 3 things we need to succeed 
1. fix lineups and rotations 
2. get sharife and jalen into the rotation 
3. fire nate mcmillanI stg @ATLHawks https://t.co/A0FhTEroXK22-point triple-double in just 35 minutes 🥱👀

@ATLHawks https://t.co/twCo3EbS7G@jovanbuha @TheAthleticNBA Atlanta Hawks, 12th Seed of the Eastern Conference, similar to the other 3 previous wins. Gonna need Anthony Davis to prevent from losing on a consistent basis to the Top 18 NBA teams with Lebron at Center.Atlanta Hawks I would be willing to trade IMO:

Delon Wright, Cam, Lou Will, Dieng, Solo Hill, TLC

Only in Some Circumstances:

John Collins, Galinari, Bogdan, Hunter, Onyeka, Jalen Johnson

Nearly Untouchable:

Capela, Huerter

Untouchable:

I'm tired of wasting Trae Great performancesWhen is Atlanta Hawks swingman Cam Reddish &amp; Red Digital Cinema Camera Company gonna collab?@CIiff0rd @jackfrank_jjf Right now with this style of play they can’t beat Top 18 NBA teams because Lebron James is only 6’8 and he doesn’t have a high-quality weakside Rim Protector. They can only beat 12th Seed Atlanta Hawks and the likes until A.D returns.@NavPRTeam @ATLHawks @TheTraeYoung Bed time kids...@labeautenoire_3 I was rockin @ATLHawks gear instead. #TrueToAtlantaSee what NBA Twitter had to say after the Los Angeles Lakers controlled both ends of the floor against the Atlanta Hawks.  https://t.co/KZKENTD9NJ@mutombolievable @ATLHawks @PackripEwing @infiniteobjects @nbatopshot @sixers you can always set it next to your fav couch spot 🤣😴@jayrigdon5 @AlexGoldenNBA Drafting Cooper IJax and Duarte what've been Pritchards greatest draft performance ever.

Oh, and in a bad game he still had 14 assists and is third in the league in scoring and assists.

You’re goddamn right an All Star.@Eypharseit @ATLHawks @socios Its not Trae's fault that coaching cant figure out how to rotate around his defensive deficiency (that entire Atlantaverse knew about from day 1). But it still needs to be talked about.

That shows how bad the Atlanta Hawks defense is.@jalengreenROY @ClappedBK @statmuse @KingJames @Lakers It means the Atlanta Hawks can use it as an excuse to why they loss even with Russell Westbrook shooting 4 for 14, scoring only 9 points. 🤣🤣🤣

Zero 3-pointers attempted and 1 for 3 at Free Throws why ???
All 3 Atlanta Hawks perimeter players are bad defenders.
