NBA: Toronto Raptors +6.5 (-116) FD

VanVleet is back and this team is getting back on track winning 2 in row after dropping 3 straight without him. This game should be more of a 2 pt spread or pickem.The @Raptors are only 6 games behind @MiamiHEAT in the East, and 4 behind 4th place @Hornets. With 16 games left, Toronto could end up amongst top 4, which would be a remarkable over-achievement &amp; validation of their unusual drafting &amp; player development scheme.

Moves like that in paint lead to easy baskets - foul - &amp; after awhile more room for your 3 pt shot - or miss.

Chill.@AnthonyMesser @enra6ed @Raptors Lol Suns were gifted a common and a flagrant 1 for Payne’s Marcus Smart-esque flops. Dude gets right up in Trent’s airspace and seems surprised when he gets hit in the head. That was some bitch shit… and so you know, I like Payne! But that was a ridiculous. Bad calls both ways.@NBA @gtrentjr @Raptors Trailblazers are stupid as hell letting him go@Santinobambino3 @ellismac67 @PhxHxC @Raptors So raps are bad cuz they need a good player but suns are good because they need their good player makes sense 🤔I need to preface, the @Suns did not lose to the @Raptors tonight bc of the NBA officials.

@ScottBarnes561 ➡️ @pskills43 https://t.co/jsJFxUZWeI@Raptors wow the suns record is a reflection of poor officiating, I had no idea they dive on every playWatching @Suns @Raptors game w/ no shot clock showed. Who’s idea was this ? #Suns@Raptors 2 phones!This funny meme also presents why the loooong Raptors are an interesting matchup for the Suns at this particular time.

When I asked Monty about it pregame he said the Suns' passes have to be accurate. Toronto will have lots of rim protection and play different defenses too. https://t.co/ATxMzIoVotPhoenix Suns - Toronto Raptors
