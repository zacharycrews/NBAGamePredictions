It’s a thing“The Chicago Bulls’ COVID-19 outbreak appears to be getting worse.”

“The Bulls aren't the only team dealing with an outbreak, either. The Charlotte Hornets, ..sent four players into the league’s health and safety protocols on Saturday.”

Welp.

https://t.co/CZw8pPJ8tR@ESPNNBA If the @Suns can trade for Miles Bridges of Charlotte #Hornets, I think they can win championships. He can be a good partner for Mikal Bridges at forward. Jae Crowder  is older than the high flying Miles Bridges.Who else is going to the @hornets game tomorrow night? #AllFly https://t.co/2oCvEWjPv9@hornets @KELLYOUBREJR love it.kelly!Battle of the point guards! @MELOD1P and the @hornets take on @TheTraeYoung and the @ATLHawks tomorrow in Atlanta! #nba #basketball #hawks #hornets -Zach K@alanhahn @Kazeem I’ll never forget I was rocking the Sega Genesis NBA Live Charlotte Hornets and was literally Showtime with LJ and Alonzo Mourning and I messed up the cartridge one day and it erased my whole 3/4 season…I’ve never recovered.@unltd76 @sixers @waheedstheWorst Doesn't make up for the playoff exit last year....we got yall back to back coming up. #NBA needs to reschedule with covid running rampant in Charlotte #sixers #Hornets@jamesdizarnell Charlotte Hornets legend Dirk NowitzkiThe whole @hornets roster is the @greensboroswarm 😂Hey @hornets?

The call for this type of HYPE play was terrible!!!! Utah can't do nun right 🤣🤣 https://t.co/Q8tL3qXQrw@MyParkBotz @greensboroswarm @hornets LaMelo, plumlee, McDaniels, and Rozier are all in health and safety protocols, that’s what happened@SaintMese247 @hornets I don’t know what development this is… Bouknight confidence will be at an all time lowThe Charlotte Hornets need to sign LiAngelo Ball@freemaneric but at the same time i think F1 can do both

like the NBA could do a full global expansion and still expect fans to care about the charlotte hornets

that might be a uniquely american thing tho@hornets Yall gonna let Bouknight play?Four players from the Charlotte Hornets have COVID, which means they can sign 1 player for tomorrow’s game
