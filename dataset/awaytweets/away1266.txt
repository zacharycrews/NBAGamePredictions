KJ had 24p/17a. SA was without injured David Robinson. #RallyTheValley https://t.co/f6CtfuuUPX@ClutchLittrell6 @StrivingFaith7 @KendrickPerkins Russell Westbrook can't help the Lakers against those 4 Phoenix Suns defenders clogging the paint. A point guard from free agency can make passes to A.D 15-18 feet away from the basket, higher priority in trades should be wing shooters.Your seat is ready!

#NBAPlayoffs #NBA75 #NBATopShot #Basketball #HoopsBets #NBABets #PlayoffPicks #GamblingTwitter https://t.co/mvvVElV8u3@GameplanChicago @Suns @NBACreative Interesting. I’d love to see that in practice. And you’re very right about the “less work the better” mantra/style of the NBA. It has led to some excruciatingly boring styles league-wide. I’ll never forget Dallas and Detroit unveiling their 2001 sets. Twinsies, and BORING AF.@earnsy602 @HouLAPhx Just in regards to his suns legacy. CP3 a better point guard. But Nash played 10 seasons in Phoenix. CP3 could surpass his suns legacy in 2 seasons with a finals win.🚨#PGsPicks
Another 2-1 winning day yesterday. Momentum and vibes are at an all time high 📈

Todays plays:

NBA: Miami Heat -1.5🔥🏀
NHL: Boston Bruins -1.5🐻🏒
NBA: Phoenix Suns -2☀️🏀

Lets flipping GO boys 🤝 @kotacappers@ClutchLittrell6 @StrivingFaith7 @KendrickPerkins You lose in the 2021 Playoffs unable to make WIDE OPEN 3-POINTERS against Phoenix Suns 4 defenders clogging the paint, you can't be so stupid to add Westbrook = 30.5% for 3-pointers career stat. 👎Watch Now, FREE 🏀NBA 2022⏬

Watch @Suns Game 🔜@NBA The @suns are Going up 3-1 #NBAPlayoffs@drippy_mec @PelicansNBA @Jim_Eichenhofer @FanDuel Yessirdee. I admire Pels’ efforts and hustle though. Phoenix is just of different level. Suns will end this at 4-1, best scenario for Pels is 4-2.4/24/83 – Exactly 1yr after defeating Denver, the Nuggets won their 2nd straight &amp; ended the 53-29 Phoenix #Suns' playoffs w/a 117-112 OT win to take the 1st Round 2-1. DEN ran off the clock from 52 to 5sec, then Alvin Scott TO'd an inbound pass. PHX: 3-10 in OT. #RallyTheValley https://t.co/fVCPplMnyb@tabet_matthew @Suns @PelicansNBA @BALLYSPORTSAZ @AZSports @az_mejor Monty needs to take the leash off Cam Johnson. If he can be even half as good as he was in his career game against the knicks we’ll be fine.@AZSportsHistory @Suns This version is meant to be a less bold that the Barkley-era @Suns version but I think somewhere in between might look sharp.

Just like the @Suns chances in the playoffs with out Booker @NGKidsBks@GameplanChicago @Suns I dig that idea. What could be cool would be the fireball larger and stretched out ala the black Hawks or green Bucks from your era with Phoenix in that font above it.Phoenix need Devin Booker, but the Suns should win the first round and have time to rest &amp; chill before the second round #NBAPlayoffs@nbatopshot @suns hopefully we get back to the finals 🙏 🙏Touched basketball after 5-6years and that too in Footprint center in a hope to make one of the three free throws bare foot. Yep, that’s right! #phoenixsuns #basketball 

P.S. - Bare foot because high-heels weren’t allowed. https://t.co/KuJHh03r1n@AZSportsHistory Always felt like there would be a need for a City Connect @Suns uniform with PHOENIX (yes, the actual name of the city) with a modified sun graphic… https://t.co/XDvLOhm46M@DrRobertCollins @philnola @Suns If the Pels lost Zion towards the end of the season that would be a viable excuse. The Pels are the team they are without Zion this year. Inserting him now might not help at all. Team chemistry plays a huge factor in the playoffs. If Ingram got hurt that would be comparable.4/24/07 – The Phoenix #Suns jumped out to a 68-47 halftime lead then cruised to a 126-98 win over the LA Lakers in Game 2 of the First Rd to take a 2-0 lead. Nash: 16p/14a in 25min. Barbosa: 26p (and stepped on Kobe's foot late). STAT: 20p/9r/4b. Kobe: 15p/4r/5a. #RallyTheValley https://t.co/B8gC6fIT4sPeople forget the @Bucks swept the @Suns in the finals last year.Good morning, happy @Suns Day! ☄️@YouTubeTV whats up w blocking the @suns game IN Arizona!?

Smth like that 🫠@Tiffany_Lv_SunS @Suns Thank you! 💜@Suns @DeandreAyton Don’t forget, he’s only 23 years old…8/ MR, Waiting, available on FND. This candid portrait was taken while waiting to board our flight home from the Phoenix airport. This shot is a statement of how we rush about only to wait again. Enjoy the moment, take a breath in the sun.

#NBAPlayoffs Juego 3@jonesmedia_ent @TheRealDealwDA In my opinion it has been a down season for the @nba let of the teams with superstars on them have had alot of injuries. @LAlakers @BrooklynNets @Suns @dallasmavs  so whoever wins the championship this season will have a hard time next year repeating.@trippy731 @Suns I’m actually in Colorado! That’s on my list though.@almalacubana @Suns Pretty picture 🧡💜On this day in sports history April 24, the Denver Nuggets defeated the Phoenix Suns 2-1 to advance to the 2nd Round of the NBA Playoffs in 1983.On this day in sports history April 24, the Phoenix Suns defeated the Denver Nuggets 2-1 to advance to the 2nd Round of the NBA Playoffs for the 4th consecutive year in 1982.@ESPNNBA He’s secretly rooting for @Suns 🙄.

Ja Morant againSpeaking of NBA owners, it’s a good time to remind everyone that the Suns historic success this season made everyone forget about how Robert Sarver has multiple allegations of racism and misogyny from SEVERAL former employees of the Phoenix Suns. https://t.co/w6WoyePPmC@Suns could have had Desmond Bane. Rare mistake by James Jones drafting Jalen Smith when Bane was still available.Wrapping up a Sunday of @nba action is Suns/Pelicans. Will Phoenix &amp; #CP3 take a big 3-1 lead or will the Pelicans &amp; Brandon Ingram even up the series?

#suns #pelicans #NBAonTNT #bettingtwitter@BallsackSports If @KDTrey5 became a @Suns I’d cry harder then I did when we lost the finalsLike a Phoenix that rises from the ashes with renewed youth to live through another cycle or a fresh sun rise in the morning. 

He has risen. @Timberwolves https://t.co/CkjWIA9gIf@hannahcookcross @Suns That's awesome. Tell him I said go Suns and yes, hopefully!@KellanOlson Quick question to @suns fans. Ever had a hamstring injury? If you have you know this day to day crap is infuriating.@FlexFromJersey Did this dude just call the Boston Celtics one of the most dominant road teams the league has seen in the last 20 years? 🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️

Boston Celtics Road Record: 23-18
Phoenix Suns Road Record: 32-9

This East Coast Bias is just embarrassing… https://t.co/XoO1WEoLewI want a Boston-Phoenix NBA Finals please. I wanna see how the Suns attack Boston’s incredible defense. I wanna see Marcus Smart vs CP3. Booker vs Tatum. Bridges vs Brown. Williams III vs Ayton. Jae vs Horford. Please basketball gods 🙏🏻@PHXMRORNG @Suns My boy was so excited to see you at Tuesday’s game and then on TV last night! He hopes he’ll get to sit by you at a game some day.@Suns This guy's is kind of goofy. But extraordinary player. Bether than Ayton.  Today@DMNGregRiddle @utahjazz @Suns He will be. And Suns in 5. Same story since Ayton and Luka were drafted.FOOTBALL SIDELINE - Head coach Wallace, engaged a mental trainer/non-invasive injury mgt specialist on his sideline to get players in the right frame of mind and to deal with injuries. @Suns @Dbacks, @NBA, @AzATA_News @AZCardinals @AZCsports@nba_paint @DeandreAyton @Suns It's hard to tell because pixels, but that's a deep-fried PELICAN@phoenix_ser If sun disk, frozen thrall, scar grounds can all get into play at the beginning of the game, so should targons peak 🙃@almalacubana @Suns ChingonPhoenix Suns &gt; .CP3/James Harden are a combined 1/26 when Scott Foster referees their playoff games, with the one win being a game Harden won against CP3. The chances of that happening are nearly 1 in one million!!? Can the @NBA explain this? @Scalabrine @TheFrankIsola @Suns @CP3 @JHarden13I’m disappointed in the Nets fr bro not takin anything away from Boston but what they puttin out there on the defensive end is atrocious Nash gotta GO!

It’s just a standard letter they have to send out to any company/business who gets on their radar. They don’t pick and choose who they send it to. I’ve seen the Cardinals do the same thing to a local business.I think if Phoenix plays the Bucks they could win and I also think the Bucks a beat the Celtics BUT if the Celtics play the Suns I agree with Boston winning. I think that matches up terribly for Phoenix https://t.co/vdKt3DOzXZSet to go into effect during Phoenix Suns Rally The Valley NBA Basketball Shirt . the Fall 2020 shows next year. the new policy stands in stark contrast to the way many brands cast shows and campaigns at present.

Tbh the packers are the only small market in sports to get respect and if they hadn’t won 13 championships they wouldn’t get shit either@iworkataceguy @Suns The snow storm was not a part of the plan! 😂@AB2screenwriter @greencalB @Patharveynews @KathieLGifford @BethFratesMD @annaliterally @markliterally @BobSnz @paulmagers @KathyWoodhood @LisaSigell Thank you Annette &amp; You-Know-Who!

I’ve been saying this for months, there are tougher matchups than Phoenix for GS imo. Warriors are gonna walk to the final, they’ve been insane, their core have stepped it up to another level. Experience showing.@_ivandaniel31 @MiaAgraviador Bro, let's just appreciate that nowadays Lakers fans actually hate on the @Suns ! Let's ride the wave because it's here to stay!

So where’s the slander for KD now? Oh wait, because that’s what we call a double standard in todays world.
