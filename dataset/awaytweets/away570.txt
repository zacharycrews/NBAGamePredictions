The Spurs are the only major sports franchise in the city and drive a good amount of the San Antonio economy. If they were to leave, it's a big deal@Bittar00 @TheTyJager Fan-by-fan basis. There are Spurs fans that have never been to San Antonio, and therefore have no connection to the city/state.

Me, personally? I'd be livid.
