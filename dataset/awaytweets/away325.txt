Houston has a bad reputation because of their records, but if you watched their most recent games you know these young players started to click together.

They’re clearly tanking so why would they trade for and play Kemba which could potentially lead to more wins?

If I were the @NBA, I’d rig the draft to not give tanking teams high picks 🤣The Houston Rockets Gerald Green had a terrible warmup and won't play.‘95 Houston rockets https://t.co/UY9XqX26uXIndeed, a great show of sportsmanship and support @HoustonRockets #NBA https://t.co/tS9MyhNboh@PickDawgz Twitter no. #198

There are now 8 other teams below .500 that Houston has played only 4 of 24 games against.

After 20 games, one would expect 6 such games, meaning the #Rockets are overdue for these next few "easy" games...The night I got the most followers and became hooked on this hellscape of an app was the night I went at Chuck to praise the Rockets, TNT aired the tweet, and it started a 3 day war between him and the Houston Rockets organization.

He was shooting 85% going into the 4th!Mikal Bridges held Steph Curry to 12 points on 4/21 shooting tonight.

The #Rockets have currently only played 5 games against those teams (and were missing a key player against Detroit and OKC game 2)

More Ws are coming.Something that I love about Ivey that would fit really well in Houston is how he pushes the pace every time. He's always running the floor and is a good decision maker on the break. Something we've been severely lacking so far this season. #Rockets #LightTheFuse #NBADraft https://t.co/4OGvDEbdTO@HoustonRockets @alperennsengun @Jaygup23 the use of “Run it back” gives me extreme PTSDAye they puttin the pressure on the Lakers for doin a new anthem!!!

https://t.co/Ii5HfVtXq4@blazersforreal Houston RocketsI don’t see why the Houston rockets would trade for Kemba Walker. Only teams I see him actually helping are the Nets and the Mavs.4 ideal Christian Wood trade scenarios from the Houston Rockets #Rockets #NBATwitter #NBA

His playing style fits well with the team and there is less ego too involved with Kemba in play.If the @HoustonRockets trade @Chriswood_5 or even think about it they would lose me as a fan because they make too many stupid decisions instead of building on what we got https://t.co/8TnRAqkC1bI wonder if Harden would’ve changed his mind on leaving had he been able to see Dame stay loyal to his city &amp; ride it out ??? Probably not..but still I wonder 💭 

because 1 thing I do know is that man LOVES Houston….my dawg just thought he could run from failure #rocketsThe Houston Rockets have officially recalled Josh Christopher, Usman Garuba, and Daishen Nix from their NBA G League affiliate.  https://t.co/U48pAFFeZu
