Toronto has lacked depth behind their starting five all season and with Gary Trent Jr. still out I do not see the Raptors keeping up with red-hot Luka Doncic who has posted three triple doubles in his last six games.Mavs (25-19) take on the Raptors (21-20) tonight. Toronto has won 7 of their last 10, but have lost 3 of 4. Kind of an enigma, there. Mavs are on the front end of back-to-back games and are sizzling hot as of late having won 9 of 10.@Raptors lol mo'bout that time

I had concerns on whether his pace, as PG, could lead Raps into the playoffs. He’s taken his play on the court to a whole other level, incl understanding when the team needed him to score vs distribute vs be a big brother.

Insanely nuts on D at rim and on perimeter and very good athlete from same place Siakam is from.@__OGtheClampGod @Raptors I agree. But I'll also add. Stop banking on our development system to turn every raw talent into a diamond. It's going to bite them more if they they think they can transform every raw player. Also stop looking just nice guys. We need pricks on this team.Chinese basketball fans yelled racial slurs at former Toronto Raptors player Sonny Weems and told him to 'get out of China' https://t.co/KckwzsVDhS@KarlTowns come on over to the @Raptors https://t.co/s2e0NumSMr@__OGtheClampGod @Raptors BRING BACK JALEN HARRIS@Eric__Smith @JmCalderon @FAN590 @cavs @Raptors Very cool@__OGtheClampGod @Raptors U got 4 guys who can put up 20 and ur worried about buckets?@LeoRautins @SwedeCanada @Raptors @gtrentjr @pskills43 @LeoRautins GOAT!
