I honestly think he is more critical to the Celtics success right now than Herro is for Miami's, as long as Butler is good to go.

Prime opportunity the Heat should take advantage of.🚨BREAKING NEWS🚨

Marcus Smart is OUT of Game 4 vs the Miami Heat due to his right ankle sprain.

HUGE loss defensively for Boston, that makes this game even more valuable.

8:30 we’ll find out if the Celtics can even it vs Miami.

@MiamiHEAT@Sedano Every championship the heat have ever won is because you bought free agents to come to Miami culture is built from within ,threw a foundation started from the roots. You over stated 1 game because Bam had appearance playing against   Daniel Theis instead of Grant Williams!! BS!!@celtics vs @MiamiHEAT has waaaaayyyy to many players out or GTD!!! I literally just lost interest in today’s game!!! https://t.co/Aw9WYFj5zD@MiamiHEAT @DoorDash you gotta get cheap order to actually get %50 off of the order lol@stephenasmith if Miami vs Heat in the Finals. Look at each team individually, would this be the least amount of talent difference from the best to worst player?

HEAT    WARRIORS 
Butler       Curry 
Bam         Green
Lowry       Thompson 
Herro        Wiggins
Oladipo    Poole@MichelobULTRA @MiamiHEAT Thank you for the support@matt_scura Great question. In my opinion, this debate can be split two ways: 

Best Players...
1. LeBron
2. Wade
3. Butler
4. Shaq
5. Bosh

and

Greatest Players (best Heat careers)...
1. Wade
2. LeBron
3. Haslem
4. Zo
5. Bosh

Considered Shaq here, but he only played 3.5 seasons in Miami.@MichelobULTRA @MiamiHEAT Yes, please #NBAPlayoffsTampa Bay Lightning - Florida Panthers

#LEGENDoftheMiamiHEAT #NBA75@MiamiHeat_Fra @dearbball 29 pts 6 passesOn a less apocalyptic note, been thinking about this: Almost every franchise in the NBA has at some point, even if only for one season, had a team that I've liked.

But I can't think of a single Miami Heat team that I've ever liked in the 30+ year history of the team. Not one.@celtics @MiamiHEAT @985TheSportsHub @TFDEaston Tell Tatum we got a game tonight and let’s not have 23 TURNOVERS please@Starchild995 @MiamiHEAT @HeatvsHaters Herro not playing today btw@kbh911_ @JPronos23 Jimmy butler du miami heatJaylen Brown is averaging 9 rebounds against the Miami heat

That's how team sports work. Miami has a ton of depth tho. They won 2 series and ahead now and are 3-3 when Kyle plays. Lost both Sixers games he played in. Jimmy Butler has carried this team thus far.@chi_lando @Use_Context @jmunderwood64 but you’re comparing them head to head so miami isn’t even really that relevant. maybe if the brons heat played the warriors all these years you could do that. but your saying that since the warriors beat the cavs steph has an argument over him for this era@SoulfuliciousV @lsgrlr @MiamiHEAT Me too. Nothing like a great @nba matchup. #GoWarriors ;)Can’t wait to see how much of a avalanche of free throws Boston receives tonight! After having 30 FTs and the Heat had only 7 !

None of this bringing the ball up crapMiami Heat key to victory today: win 1 quarter and watch the world fall apartAs a @MiamiHEAT fan, I'm genuinely irritated at the narrative the "experts" have been peddling. If the Heat wins, it's because the other team played poorly, and if the Heat loses, it's because the other team played well. They're the #1 seed for a reason. The disrespect is REAL.@MiamiHEAT The player being allocated 26.7MP/PG (his actions impact the final outcome because his % of MP is so significant) in the '22 playoffs while posting a -33.5 on/off net diff being out has a much higher chance to help the team win than hurt

2 pointers count, too, you know!
When Bam is agressive in the paint, the wing defenders collapse.

LFG Miami!!As for Heat - Celtics, I'm still undecided on the spread due to all the Miami injuries.

Also, I don’t think anyone in Miami can stop Looney if he decides to bully them in the paint, not even Bam. 
I know I’m biased but I don’t see any of these teams beating the Warriors 4 times in 7 games.@MiamiHEAT Can Micky pay the refs this time?

Curry has never been the best player on the warriors team with kd.@warriors are definitely a juggernaut once again--as important as 2vmore wins are for @MiamiHEAT--or 3 for @celtics--both teams need to think ahead.Chances are @warriors will have 8 prep days--#easternconferencechamps, much less.Remember about #GANAS:who wants it more,why,&amp; how..Bout That Life @MiamiHEAT 🔥@jamesratiodyou @yaboijt1646 @udntknowball @kenobikerem @MiamiHEAT If he couldn’t shoot and couldn’t defend he wouldn’t be in the league lol@MarkJonesESPN @MiamiHEAT @celtics @heydb @McNuttMonica @ESPNRadio Can't forget he hung 37 on Boston as a rookie in the ECFThe Miami Heat are 69-50 when Scott Foster officiates their games. https://t.co/4oDXUXxnqtHow does Jayson Tatum bounce back from a rough Game 3 vs. the Heat? | Get Up #Miami #Heat #NBA Video: https://t.co/zrdrMzWKKA@IraHeatBeat No, only if you're one of the losers in sports media, or a corny Celtics fan who gets their b ball IQ from them...

The Miami Heat go up 3-1 today. 

Roll call. #heatnation where we at?Miami Heat +220? I’ll take itNo one would argue the Bubble Finals was the same as an 82 game season. But with a healthy Lakers and Heat match-up it's fair to say they were both legitimate contenders in retrospect. Heck Miami has been more consistent than LA since https://t.co/FgGqijhYZy@TheErnieAvila @espn @GetUpESPN @MiamiHEAT Bro dm time your number. I’ve been texting you for the past week🆕 @TheAthletic 

When the Philadelphia 76ers lost to the Miami Heat this month, they joined the Utah Jazz in #PlayoffPurgatory: a place NBA teams go when they are good enough to make 5 straight postseasons but can't get to conference finals. A bad place.

https://t.co/EvtwPegl5cI'm grew up in South Florida where sports are a big thing, particularly basketball &amp; the Miami Heat. I'm not a sporty spice, so I was definitely a bandwagon fan.

Now I live in Tampa where hockey &amp; the TB Lightning reign supreme, so I am morphing into an hockey fan &amp; I love it 💙Let's go @MiamiHEAT https://t.co/F2zQshwXom@Soldadodel10 @MitchValencia9 @MiamiHEAT @VicOladipo You need to listen to your username and shh@MiamiHEAT @VicOladipo If Oladipo had made his come back with the Lakers, national media would have treated it like the 2nd coming.

Your @MiamiHEAT have an opportunity to go up 3-1 today. 

Easy? Absolutely not. I expect un real desperation from the #Celtics.

Possible? Yes! #Bam can’t be satisfied with game 3.

@MiamiHEAT vs. @celtics@Alf954 @Maida904 @mrie011 @miaheatbeat the Miami heat played this game equivalent to the early 2010 Seahawks. You can't call everything.

It's you and your belief in @MiamiHEAT@AndreyR45917346 @TheHerd @ColinCowherd @NBA @celtics @MiamiHEAT Those refs were delusional in the @celtics TD GARDEN they let #boston get away with all types of flop and fouls Grant Williams is a dirty player and has tried to hurt @Bam1of1 multiple times he threw Max Strus to the ground it’s ridiculous @MiamiHEAT@CELTICSvsEvery1 @courtcorner @miaheatbeat @5ReasonsSports JA MORANT never returned when Jordan Poole did this … Jimmy Butler did not play the second half after this.

Nowadays probably Miami. Thinking they have heat culture when they just have an all time great head coach. They think Jim a superstar is when I knew them mfs were lost@CELTICSvsEvery1 @courtcorner @miaheatbeat @5ReasonsSports Why do @celtics fans do this ? Why do they obviously lie ?

The math not mathing here. You know the heat won 2 games right?I believe the #Celtics will bounce back and take Game 4 to tie the set. Ultimately, I see this going 7, and have no clue who will win in Miami. You'd have to consider the Heat the favorites in that situation, but that certainly doesn't mean the C's can't advance. https://t.co/J4rQLv2GCc@MiamiHEAT YALL NEED TO WIN.

Celtics and heat are the best defenses and heat are giving the Celtics problems. The mavs defense isn’t on the level of Boston or MiamiIf @warriors finish them off on Tuesday, they could have a very long rest for the NBA Finals. 

With @Garydwayne and Otto Porter resting until then. 

The @MiamiHEAT / @celtics is going at least 6 or 7 games.You know whay I think the problem with the media and the Heat Cs series is...
