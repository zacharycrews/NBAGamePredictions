lets face it it's gonna be like last year where Jimmy was the guy mianly setting up most plays@IcyGamel @JoogMasterMike @seba_clement @MiamiHEAT I'm not the one who said he has to lose weight.

There’s no need to push the issue. Lowry came back and finished the first game, but it’s better to be safe than sorry.@vloneantichrist @MiamiHEAT That too. We should be able to handle them#FreePicks

So that means the Miami heat got a pass for having injured players in the bubble finals 

Or gsw having hurt players in the 16 finals 
 Injuries happen and if your going to give passes give all of them@TheAthleticNBA @Klow7 @MiamiHEAT 3 of the four others you've mentioned are on the Lakers@SRochesterNBA @MiamiHEAT @arodz777 Thanks man!I can't wait just got my NBA Pass to watch #HeatCulture @MiamiHEAT all season!Analysis of the day

Pacers playing on the second night of a back to back in a game that went into overtime last night so there’s an advantage but still a tough team to beat especially in Indy as we’ve seen over the years. Gotta keep it rollin tho!

#HeatCulture🔥 https://t.co/3qGU2vNwpK@deej218 @SheBeHittin @statmuse @MiamiHEAT @JimmyButler It's a team sport@CharlesMilian @HeatvsHaters @MiamiHEAT Facts and Indiana is coming off a back2back overtime game🔒 Heat -4

Indiana's defense is absolutely terrible. Plus they're on a B2B and Torrey Craig, Justin Holiday and Jeremy Lamb are all game-time decisions so their wing rotation could be in shambles.

Miami is a prime regression candidate, but I still like them in this spot.@jtzus @MiamiHEAT Let’s go!!

Its so funny how cocky Bucks fans are that they won't admit the Heat are coming for them. They completely shut Giannis and Middleton down. Coach Spo has come back with a completely different game plan offensively. Lowry makes this team elite on both ends of the court.I’m just taking it in, Miami Heat can be a real problem in the East because that team is tough!

Butler and Lowry are good – we know that. 
But if Tyler Herro can find the same level of play that he showed in the pre-season and in the opening match – Miami will be a force to be reckoned with.  1 Unit@TheMiamiHeatUK @Pacers Hoping for another @MiamiHEAT win.@fcbjosee @305ontherisee @JrueBurnerAcct @MiamiHEAT Damn so giannis swept yall with a g league player as his 2nd option, truly the best in the nba.Ec Semi’s my prediction:

He didn't commit a foul. Was switching &amp; guarding Tatum &amp; Brown.

Also Raptors game is played at a fast pace... he's allowed to dribble the ball up the court... Something he's never done on the Heat. 

Goran even said Miami put him in a box.@MiamiHEAT @OmerYurtseven5 The Heat look really tough this year. Especially with the addition of Kyle Lowry. Can you believe what they did to the Bucks on their opening night !@_mattyc_ @SInow @CP3 @KingJames @teamlebron @carmeloanthony @nuggets @Chris_Ballard33 @si_vault @DwyaneWade @MiamiHEAT Pretty sure there’s three different covers one says LeBron and friends one says Melo and friends and one says D Wade and friends#Miami #Heat: Year 1  ...

Totally kidding. I like the roadmap. Like the mint counts. Everything looks good to me ✌️If anyone think the east is not going thru the Miami Heat if they stay healthy is blind as a bat.@jjfraizerr @mindonabillion_ @a2andone Lebron James left the Miami Heat on a mission to bring a Championship to his hometown, BUT LEBRON IS NOT FROM CLEVELAND. 😄😄😄@MongoFeliciano @MiamiHEAT Hey man… I was there. Let me know next time!@Lowendtay445 @MiamiHEAT @JimmyButler new season bud, you got clapped🤭 whole different season and you still living in may. time goes my boy, your team looking real tough👹 getting clapped by the so called "LEAT" yet why aint giannis get 20 points? oh and we boutta pick up john wall too, good luck, see u in the p.o.Yall would play at night when the @MiamiHEAT game will be on 😒 https://t.co/NwpVYJGyzb@SirAfthadis @maalymaaltv @MiamiHEAT @JimmyButler Not funny@MiamiHEAT This one has such quality that you can tell you had 158 days to work on it.Miami Heat release extensive injury report for Saturday’s game vs. Indiana Pacers: https://t.co/RiWNosZTGlFTX just gave $500 in crypto to every person sitting in one section of the arena for the Miami Heat season opener.

Don’t sleep on how powerful this sponsorship will be. https://t.co/CF6iHCVV8PTake precious back @MiamiHEATThe fact that after all that he is still playing at a very high level should be reason right there he top 75 wtf. Youngest player to win an mvp. First year took his team to the playoffs. Battled against the damn big 3 of the Miami heat without another big time scorer. https://t.co/fiTJcHNyatI'm finding that collecting what I like on Topshot (99% Miami Heat Moments) essentially puts me out of every Showcase Challenge going forward.  I do love these Showcases tho and think the @nbatopshot team nailed it once again

@roham, when Miami Heat/Team Specific Challenges?  😎Jimmy Butler went from despising the Miami Heat to being one of their best players@ShandaRoberts76 @MiamiHEAT 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽congratulations 🎊@JC_Reich @MKEBucksNation @MiamiHEAT No I think that’s when it just changed lol 😂@Miamisportsfre1 @MKEBucksNation @MiamiHEAT Yeah, but that 1st championship doesn't count since they were still wearing short shorts...Say how old you are without saying your age? Me: I remember when the Miami Heat were in the Western Conference.@BenRauman @BucksFilmRoom Is Heat Culture basically Bron choosing to play with Dwade? 😂😂😂😂😂😂. Cause Bron and Dwade ain’t walking through the door.  Giannis laughed at Heat Culture which was supposed to bring him to Miami.@MiamiHEAT @OmerYurtseven5 Omer Yurtseven is the man!
