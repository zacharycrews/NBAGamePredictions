We put up a great game and got almost all of our shots. Another great game for tatum as he went into the paint almost ever play. We did the best we could especially since we went again the best team in the league https://t.co/gk4JZH3LvR@celtics Nice job resigning Robert Williams dere Brad!@Stevieboyj1000 @OfficialPDC @DropkickMurphys I’m a Boston Celtics fan and they walk out to it so I loved hearing Brendan come out to that, loved it even more when he won!@celtics Celtics have no excuse. The Spurs were 4-13 before they won last night.@celtics I think the Coach need to stop this buddy thing Enes Kenter played very well . I still don’t know why he replaced him with Al Horford.@Younghandsome71 @celtics Brown can’t step up when Tatum on the court tho he regress &amp; plays Robin to his Batman only when JT has an off night is when he step up . They both should be on fire together@celtics Can y'all put Tatum out as well? I'm tired of being disappointed in himCeltics need to sign John Wall wtf is we doing ?! @celtics@celtics The celtics are gonna suck for a long time because they are dead set on building around tatum, brown. Its obviously not working but meanwhile hayward and rozier look great in Charlotte. Celtics can't spot or develop talent@celtics Another L because the ball will be sticking in Tatum's hands, who has been playing like shit. And everyone will tall about how it will get better next time...yuck@celtics Trade the coach.@celtics This team is soft, injury after injury, year after year, I'm done being a Celtics fan.@EnergySports12 @BasketB0t @celtics Yeah right....every time his man scores he’s standing behind him.@celtics Should be a win then.....BOSTON CELTICS BOSTON CELTICS BOSTON CELTICS BOSTON CELTICS@leveillejeremy @celtics Nah, he just plays in the NBA. If you have a unique or desired skillset, they pretty much just let you play when you feel like it.@celtics Lol Jaylen brown has tunnel vision and doesn’t move the ball he doesn’t drive and kick. He doesn’t move on the perimeter or move around off ball. Lol he’s not even being asked to do the same things as Tatum. And get the benefit of Tatums gravity.@EnergySports12 @celtics “Elite” lol 😂@celtics Damn Rob must be really sick@jwc292 @celtics He was lol it was the players who were tuning him out because they thought they knew better@CeltsnPats @celtics Yea he was great last year@celtics Tough sledding this year.@celtics Always does!! Brown and Tatum always try to go one on one. Brad! And this NEW coach are one in the same!! Won’t stand up and stop the foolishness and keep losing!! Mediocre is for a lot of other franchises!! NOT BOSTON!!! Can Bill coach Basketball to?@ItsMe_Chauntice @celtics The Celtics still have a 1 on 1 isolation problem. Tatum has been near the top of the league in isos and bottom of the league in success every yr including this one since his second year, while Jaylen brown has gotten better and more efficient every year. He's far from the issue.The road to superstardom is not easy. ☘
