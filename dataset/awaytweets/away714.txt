He is a damn good talented player but to say he doesn’t deserve to be pulled out the game for some of the back to back to back boneheaded things he does is some straight 💩."He's able to score the basketball when his three point shot is not falling."

@ashahahmadi and @realdellcurry take an in depth look at the ability of @MELOD1P to create and get to the free throw line.

👉 https://t.co/LJnpUvEArG @wagertalk@EASTERN_NBA @hornets I mean, with what happened last season after he went down and again this season, it's kinda starting to become a pattern.@xochurch @borrego2hell @hornets @LendingTree ????why does Cody need 40 . Melo need stop lat more minutes than Cody@NBA @hornets scoreboard@hornets @LendingTree Should help that nearly Indiana’s whole squad is out. #AllFlyTORONTO — Pascal Siakam had 24 points and matched his career high with 12 assists, and Gary Trent Jr. scored a season-best 32 for the Toronto Raptors in a 125-113 victory over the Charlotte Hornets on Tuesday night. https://t.co/6mHAZJxiAu@borrego2hell @hornets @LendingTree But ish and Cody bro! Cody getting his 40 minutes so we should play melo less tonight I think@HonorThyKing @hornets Not saying he played great but 25 and 4 boards like 7 assists he was the best one last night. It’s a trend it’s not just the only time it happened lmao@xochurch @hornets Man 🤫 . Everybody played like ass, including Melo. Quit dk riding…. Can’t be a liability AND get more minutes, repeat dumb mistakes gets Melo benched every time annnnd whining to the refs while the other team pushes the ball and score easily. Good thing u are not the coach 🤧 https://t.co/1iTY5GWrik@hornets Yall out there playing like yall been HIGH https://t.co/gIhlSm9gB0@borrego2hell @hornets @LendingTree Ish can’t play defense. Bouk is still learning. Lamelo can only play defense when he can gamble and he can’t gamble when surrounded by dudes who can’t play defense…… no clue how Borrego thought that lineup was a vibe.Pascal Siakam @pskills43 registered 24 points (9-16 FG, 1-2 3Pt, 5-5 FT), nine rebounds, 12 
assists and one block across 39 minutes during Tue's 125-113 win over 
the @Hornets !

https://t.co/LFLWJ6yZLz https://t.co/p3oDTNGh8E@hornets Let’s sit melo after 8 points in the first 7 min. Give Cody 40 minutes with bad defense and even worse offense, fuck it let’s play ish prolly 10 and then maybe some terry rozier if he remembers there is a game day@HornetsOnBally @ashahahmadi @realdellcurry @hornets Still in disbelief that y’all lost lolWhat James Bouknight did vs Toronto shows the Charlotte Hornets need to play him more https://t.co/ZxZfD8kkUC https://t.co/BsUO2nfvCiDoes anyone have any Charlotte @hornets ticket connections or advice for tickets?

Many also considered the fact that there is still snow/ice on the ground from the weekend with many fans driving 1-2 hours to games@Manlisten811 @ArizonaMBB @hornets @dallasmavs Was this a parlay??@hornets I know what is going here, a overload on the players since they have to defend the paint too other than defending the perimeter. They urgently need a centre to get hold of these problems.Congratulations Toronto @Raptors on your 125-113 win over the Charlotte Hornets 2021-2022NBASeason@hornets @HusqvarnaUSA 9-22 since last season without Gordon and ppl rly want to trade him for a Plumlee that jacks threes.Really Surprised Charlotte couldn’t take care of the Raptors without Vanvleet and Scottie today

It's the JB wants it, and quite frankly I think it's the way Charlotte wants it.@Pajita06 @Josh1232js @hornets Lmao wtf are you talking about@xochurch @CurtisJermaine2 @hornets I guarantee you he led to 25+ of their points so yeah@HornetsPR @hornets Coach@HornetsPR @hornets Tell the fucking coats to play some fucking Defense@Josh1232js @kai_m_h @hornets What Charlotte needs is a spark. They are playing slow, and this is counter productive to their team D, as they are undersized. Charlotte's best D is their fast offense, as it speeds up the other team too.@Josh1232js @hornets it's just coincidence. He's not a good defender and he's not amazing on offense either (except when he turns into MJ which hardly ever happens).@Tella1Truth @CurtisJermaine2 @hornets I agree I love that he’s on our team I just also acknowledge when he flat out sucks lol@panthersfannnn @CurtisJermaine2 @hornets 11 points 4 assists in 14 minutes is awful?@kai_m_h @Josh1232js @hornets I think Bobcat fans just be saying anything, because it's Melo, and he has more fans than the whole franchise. They probably did not even vote for him to be an All Star.He will be out of their hair soon thou, and they will get their team back.@hornets Anyone who still defends james borrego is an idiot. And Michael Jordan will regret in a couple of years when Lamelo leaves that he allowed his star player to be treated like this since the beginning.@SamFarberLive @hornets @jam3s210 Can we please start playing some semblance of defense? 76 points given up at halftime is embarrassing!@kai_m_h @CurtisJermaine2 @hornets He’ll be back strong second half. He looked out of sorts when he got taken out. We need defense. He would’ve been in but Bouk was just playing a bit better@hornets The game is over, no need to play the second half@hornets We played defense for a week and then shitted it out over the weekend@panthersfannnn @hornets lol this was a good first half from him?@Tella1Truth @hornets Some people still in denial about it@Josh1232js @hornets Your team doesn’t know how to play defense@panthersfannnn @hornets Idk about awful😂,but he hasn't been playing like himself lately. I wonder if it's because his minutes are not very consistent or he is just in a funk. I still think he needs to be on the floor, unless you just don't believe in him@michael444888 @hornets No comment@Rhe10k @hornets When things are good lamelo is great, but when we are struggling lamelo is too chaotic and leads to more easy points for the other team. I’m rooting for him next halfWashington's early ejection hurting Hornets on boards and with floor spacing, two areas that were already going to be challenging coming in

Charlotte is doing a good job getting to the line though (15/19; 79%)@panthersfannnn @CurtisJermaine2 @hornets Cuz he’s the only reason anyone outside of Charlotte watches the hornets.. it’s not just tonight it’s in general@NCAArefsgamble @hornets @NBA Thats just not how it works my guy.... Let's say the two los Angeles teams and the two NY teams become really bad for 5 years... you really think the NBA is gonna kick out the teams that generate the most renevue?@Pajita06 @hornets He’s the reason we ain’t winning 😂 can’t win a game without the man@hornets Geez, absolutely no defense.@Josh1232js @hornets Sorry raptors team? they are literally better than the hornets lmaoTime to regroup.

#AllFly | @hornets https://t.co/BGapnu7eM2@Pajita06 @Josh1232js @hornets He’s a big reason. Makes us tick@hornets Play some fucking Defense@AlmightyTaka_ @hornets The coach doesn’t like him we know this already might as well stop complaining about it tbh it is what it is@panthersfannnn @hornets hes one of our best defenders statistically lol and bouknight is horrible on defense@hornets We have another center sitting on bench@nizcomixalt @hornets Seriously. Dude just letting everyone dunk. To his defense he ain’t a center@ZoWrId @hornets @jam3s210 Terry more trade able.  Gordon is unwantedThe Raptors shot 62% in the first half. 

That’s the 2nd-highest fg% by an opponent in a half against the Hornets this season. 

Portland shot 64.4% in the first half against Charlotte on 12/17.It’s amazing that the Charlotte hornets are 25 and 20 and the have worst defense in the league. #nodefense@jamesraps23 @hornets if he has 30@hornets Wow, given up 70 pts by halftime. Awful.@Josh1232js @hornets Hes not the reason we are losingHALFTIME: @Raptors 76, @hornets 61

Pascal Siakam 19 pts, 8 ast, 7 reb
Gary Trent Jr. 15 pts, 2 ast, 6/10 FG

Second half coming up next with @Eric__Smith &amp; @Paul__Jones on the call📻 https://t.co/kGILl37UoU https://t.co/89cjEpF4hd@CurtisJermaine2 @hornets He was playing awful. What do you expect?@CurtisJermaine2 @hornets Cause he’s been awful… 0 for his last 11 3’s, and he lets his guy past him every time on defense. Why should he play more?3 point shooting is the difference so far here in Toronto. 

Charlotte is shooting 65% from 2
Raptors are shooting 63% from 2

@hornets are 78% at the FT line
Toronto is 72% at the FT line

#BuzzCity 4 for 22 from 3 (22%)
Toronto is 10 for 17 from 3 (58%)

CHA down 15 at half.Fight back pls @hornets@hornets These guys are a joke@hornets Don’t want to hear anyone talk about trading Gordon anymore and his contract. Lmao. Can’t even beat a sorry raptors team without him@hornets We’re on pace to score 122 and still lose by 30 lol@hornets You can’t be serious???@hornets Dont post a picture of Miles "playing defense" he's been getting abused all night w all due respect@hornets Why melo play similar time as plumlee@hornets Borrego likes bouk over lamelo now lol. That’s what happens when you can’t play a lick of defense@hornets Just give it to Miles and get out his way@hornets Melo getting Bumlee like minutes. Hate to see it.@hornets @jam3s210 He better than lamelo offensively@hornets they're on pace to score 150 my gosh@hornets Apparently Hayward needs to make $100M a year@ROBERTORAMOSBOA @hornets I’m sure Charlotte is just chomping at the bit to trade their franchise player…..@hornets Back to playing no defense@hornets Idc if we win or lose, bouk needs to see consistent minutes from here going forward.@GreatScott_11 @hornets Hes a screw up and screws up trying to show boat .. maybe he on drugs@KyleBaileyClub @hornets @Raptors Complete horse crap but moving on. What I want to know is why JB refuses to still play Nick. They are attacking the paint on every play for layups and kick outs. Nick is a legit big body shot blocker who can help. Why not play him?@hornets Toronto just won’t miss@hornets @jam3s210 Drive it in 👊@hornets @jam3s210 All fly no brainTough finish @MilesBridges! 

#AllFly | @hornets https://t.co/twWRoLh7pDOnce again, I’m finally able to catch a @hornets game, and they are losing to team they shouldn’t be losing to@ZoWrId @xochurch @hornets @jam3s210 Both if we can get a good center@hornets DEFENSE? WHAT IS THAT?@xochurch @hornets @jam3s210 Hayward not Terry@hornets @jam3s210 When Miles isn’t 3 hunting he’s a Godthis is subjective as the charlotte hornets could review these stats after the game. https://t.co/iCrPYyi8mg@hornets @jam3s210 Terry and melo the future. Love terry but if him and Pj gotta go to get someone like turner you gotta do it@hornets @jam3s210 He’s the only one that actually showed up to work. Everyone else was a no call/no show.@hornets @jam3s210 am i dreaming??? we’re actually playing our rookies?!many folks are saying that the charlotte hornets have been cursed without me in attendance since i was at friday's win over the oklahoma city thunder@That_Caucasian @hornets @T_Rozzay3 @HornetsOnBally Arena only letting 1000 in due to covid in Canada.Go to work @jam3s210 😤

#AllFly https://t.co/C4HR2XZEjqCan I have 50 dollars @hornets@guamtrash @hornets @MELOD1P With PJ being ejected team had no forwards so he had to go all guards@GreatScott_11 @hornets Hope he gets traded to Philly so he can leave this poverty franchise and win a ring🙏@ZoWrId @hornets @MELOD1P Ish don’t playCharlotte hornets defense is looking like a joke. And y'all had the bonus for like 7 minutes the first quarter and instead of driving constantly you chose to go 1 for 6 in 3s #hornets@hornets @MELOD1P Team sucks stop posting!!!13 points in the 2nd quarter for @hornets rookie @jam3s210 

Charlotte trailing by 15 with 3:16 left in the half.@hornets let’s close out the half strong get it down to single digits #AllFlyThe Charlotte Hornets used to have one of the hottest sports brands in the 90's. Outside of Chicago Bulls gear you'd see a lot of Hornets jerseys, hats, jackets etc worn for "style". Now their jerseys say "CHA" with a number underneath and it looks like no effort was put into it.@guamtrash @hornets @MELOD1P Whoa whoa we need positivity even though it’s trueThis is the last time the hornets of Charlotte play with my money@hornets @MELOD1P This team is awful. JB essentially gift wrapped this game with that piss poor lineup. We belong nowhere near the postseason.@ZoWrId @hornets @MELOD1P Ish only plays when team injured when healthy he doesn’t play@hornets @MELOD1P Bouknight needs Ish minutes respectfullythe @hornets simply have no interest in playing defence@hornets @MELOD1P Miles Bridges is on your basketball team use him@hornets @MELOD1P @Fazolis HAS BOMB WINGS!!! 🔥🔥🔥 https://t.co/3Gv0OtaMjD@hornets Get on it guys! #AllFlyDamn @hornets came to Scotiabank empty Arena and thought it was scrimmage and no need to play D #Raptors #WeTheNorth@hornets Sorry Stans, but LaMelo has been a liability lately. Shooting poorly and turning the ball over a lot. Hornets need him. Hope he can pick it up quickly.@AFCPasha @camutdforever @hornets I'll just keep reading all the Hornets fans comments about what a stellar fellow PJ is and how shocked everyone is, and who started it. From Hornets fans. Thanks.@hornets Team is trash 🗑 I can’t express that enough@hornets argh, my tv doesn't show your game, i wish you luck, comeback is realHornets got to within 8 early in Q2, but Raptors have pushed lead back to 15 (55-40); Charlotte squandering too many advantageous offensive opportunities

Q2 6:30@hornets Get ish out of the team@HornetsOnBally @MELOD1P @hornets Foul@hornets Wow you guys are brutal, I didn’t know it was possible to miss so many layups because they run in uncontrolled@HornetsOnBally @jam3s210 @hornets We see you boukyyyyClassic Charlotte sports right here @hornetsBlow by! 💨

@MELOD1P | @hornets | #AllFly https://t.co/IktwyFb1fL@KyleBaileyClub @hornets @Raptors Right callTighten up @hornets  !!!!!@hornets Free 3J he did nothing wrong@hornets To all the Hayword haters it’s amazing how much better the Hornets play when Gordon Hayward is just on the floorWe see you rook! 💪

@jam3s210 | #AllFly | @hornets https://t.co/HCo52lkTAN@hornets get y’all act togetherSo the @hornets must have greased the palms of the incompetent @NBA refs really well tonight. We all know that @NBA loves nothing more than to shit on Canada. Screw you, Yankee crap. Do better.Lol Alvin Williams is cold. 

Devlin "Charlotte hasn't committed a single foul yet this game 10-0 in fouls " 

Alvin "that's because the hornets don't play defence they just let you go right by them"Yay @Hornets can commit a foul!!! #Raptors@hornets Every time you start to get our hopes up you start this BS again@camutdforever @hornets also the hip check from pj started it but got no call.@hornets Miles defense needs to be better@hornets Tricked us into thinking they could play defense@hornets PJ shouldn’t have been ejected. I cannot stand NBA refs@hornets Also pj shouldn’t have been ejected when the other guy started it.@hornets Please tell your troglodyte center to calm down and stay away from my undrafted rookie?Toronto Raptors vs. Charlotte Hornets

Tell your box score people@hornets PJ wasn’t about to be part of another blowout. Smart man.@hornets @T_Rozzay3 @HornetsOnBally This team sucks!! Had one good week and they think they can just win every game without trying! I hate this coach and I can’t stand watching this team play like trash every year. Absolutely ridiculous. Probably lose to the Pacers and LeBron about to drop 80 on these bums 🗑🗑🗑@KyleBaileyClub @hornets @Raptors We were already struggling defensively too. That hurts.@hornets lottery team@Grandson_Yates @Raptors @hornets Bizarre flex given the dirty hornet player but whatever. Raptors lost a lot.@OfficialNBARefs refs caused the double techs in @raps @hornets game by letting the chippy play go right before their eyes that escalated. Refs putting players well being at riskThe @Raptors (+100) lead the @hornets 39-27 after 1! 🔥

#WeTheNorth 
 https://t.co/zrAZuD6DvTRaptors lead 39-27 after one quarter on Charlotte despite 10 free throw attempts for Hornets, zero for Toronto. Three-point shooting matters.1q: #Raptors 39, #Hornets 27

Charlotte is 3-12 from 3PT, continuing its cold shooting.

PJ Washington was ejected.

Other than that things are promising. https://t.co/0cjTXUec0QDirty @Raptors sent a 2-way contract guy to head hunt the @hornets best paint defender in the first corner smh. Both ejected but not like the Raptors lost much. #AllFlyBoth ejected. @Hornets lose PJ, and the @Raptors lose Justin Champagnie. Think Toronto wins that one, as Eric Collins just pointed out. Charlotte already down Hayward and McDaniels, now PJ. Champagnie averages 2 ppg and is on a 2-way contract. https://t.co/PTKnDkbQx5@tradestreetpost @hornets Hayward is more important than most people realize. He steadies the offense when things get out of whack.Pj Man U can’t afford to be getting ejected you know child support due this week GET YOUR HEAD IN THE GAME #charlottehornets@davidlonderee @hornets Yep.  I was a bit worried when Hayward went down but the impact has been more than I expectedimma need ya to turn it up a lil bit @hornets@tradestreetpost @hornets Man, they’re struggling these last two games.Try again next game @hornets smh@LOrangeMusic @hornets I know what you mean.
Rule of thumb is when you aren’t hitting from distance you move in and find your shot…unless you’re the hornets.  In that case just keep launching 🧱@HornetsOnBally @MELOD1P @hornets got fouled a good 2-3 timesLaMelo takes it all the way! 

@MELOD1P | #AllFly | @hornets https://t.co/xXV35BT3EZGo get someone who can go get a bucket on command until Melo gets his NBA legs @hornets. Or at least a security post valve when the 3s aren’t flying cause SHIT@tradestreetpost @hornets Or start making them@HornetsOnBally @hornets Unwatchable for me.The Hornets are 5 for their last 45 from 3.

4 for 36 Sunday against Atlanta, 1 for 9 to start this one.

@hornets trail 32-18 with 3:17 left in the 1st quarterWell. The Hornets appear to be losing.
