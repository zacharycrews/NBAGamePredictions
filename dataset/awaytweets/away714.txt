üëâ https://t.co/LJnpUvEArG @wagertalk@EASTERN_NBA @hornets I mean, with what happened last season after he went down and again this season, it's kinda starting to become a pattern.@xochurch @borrego2hell @hornets @LendingTree ????why does Cody need 40 . Melo need stop lat more minutes than Cody@NBA @hornets scoreboard@hornets @LendingTree Should help that nearly Indiana‚Äôs whole squad is out. #AllFlyTORONTO ‚Äî Pascal Siakam had 24 points and matched his career high with 12 assists, and Gary Trent Jr. scored a season-best 32 for the Toronto Raptors in a 125-113 victory over the Charlotte Hornets on Tuesday night. https://t.co/6mHAZJxiAu@borrego2hell @hornets @LendingTree But ish and Cody bro! Cody getting his 40 minutes so we should play melo less tonight I think@HonorThyKing @hornets Not saying he played great but 25 and 4 boards like 7 assists he was the best one last night. It‚Äôs a trend it‚Äôs not just the only time it happened lmao@xochurch @hornets Man ü§´ . Everybody played like ass, including Melo. Quit dk riding‚Ä¶. Can‚Äôt be a liability AND get more minutes, repeat dumb mistakes gets Melo benched every time annnnd whining to the refs while the other team pushes the ball and score easily. Good thing u are not the coach ü§ß https://t.co/1iTY5GWrik@hornets Yall out there playing like yall been HIGH https://t.co/gIhlSm9gB0@borrego2hell @hornets @LendingTree Ish can‚Äôt play defense. Bouk is still learning. Lamelo can only play defense when he can gamble and he can‚Äôt gamble when surrounded by dudes who can‚Äôt play defense‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ no clue how Borrego thought that lineup was a vibe.Pascal Siakam @pskills43 registered 24 points (9-16 FG, 1-2 3Pt, 5-5 FT), nine rebounds, 12 
assists and one block across 39 minutes during Tue's 125-113 win over

That‚Äôs one of several potential destinations listed here:
https://t.co/JSiLdHs4jK@J2Bred @Josh1232js @hornets yeah i know that but i believe we ll be better if we trade him for a good center@hornets @MELOD1P @HornetsOnBally Garland clears@hornets @MELOD1P @HornetsOnBally Holy what a comeback@hornets @MELOD1P @HornetsOnBally TAKE MARTIN OUT OF THD FUCKING GAME.@MELOD1P gets üÜô

#AllFly | @HornetsOnBally https://t.co/V3U4OmBRh9@Pajita06 @Josh1232js @hornets That‚Äôs not a coincidence. That is a 30 game sample size  they drop off offensively n defensively. Weather you like him or not he‚Äôs a sub 20 points per game scorer on nearly 50% fg shooting@xochurch @ZoWrId @hornets @jam3s210 This is cap and you know itone normal game. that‚Äôs all i ask

@realmadrid @hornets@J2Bred @Josh1232js @hornets Just coincidence, i wouldnt be mad at all if we trade him for a center defensive mindedCharlotte opens the 2nd half on an 11-2 run. @hornets are now shooting 52% from the field.

#BuzzCity is 12-0 this season when shooting 50% or better from the field. 

Toronto up 6 with 8:54 left in the 3rd.

#AllFlyHangin with LaMelo! 

@MELOD1P | @hornets | #AllFly https://t.co/e2kJq8pqzP@J2Bred @Pajita06 @hornets ^ all they need to knowCheck out 2020-21 Panini Illusions #151 LaMelo Ball RC Charlotte Hornets https://t.co/zdRd17OBBe @eBay@Pajita06 @Josh1232js @hornets Hornets are 9-22 when Hayward doesn‚Äôt play@ClebanTyrone @hornets @jam3s210 Cause he's a Scorer??? But if you said Offensively it's LaMelo cause he can pass but if you say Scoring it's Bouknight.@CurtisJermaine2 @kai_m_h @hornets Lmao Jesus. Sounds good, bud.Can‚Äôt decide if I want to play ad against the hornets or sixers this back to back coming up. AD gives the better shot to beat sixers but if you play him and lose to Philly it‚Äôs an iffy game against charlotte. Could be 0-2. Might be better to take an L and go 1-1@panthersfannnn @Tella1Truth @hornets When Melo is flat, he sits. It's the JB wants it, and quite frankly I think it's the way Charlotte wants it.@Pajita06 @Josh1232js @hornets Lmao wtf are you talking about@xochurch @CurtisJermaine2 @hornets I guarantee you he led to 25+ of their points so yeah@HornetsPR @hornets Coach@HornetsPR @hornets Tell the fucking coats to play some fucking Defense@Josh1232js @kai_m_h @hornets What Charlotte needs is a spark. They are playing slow, and this is counter productive to their team D, as they are undersized. Charlotte's best D is their fast offense, as it speeds up the other team too.@Josh1232js @hornets it's just coincidence. He's not a good defender and he's not amazing on offense either (except when he turns into MJ which hardly ever happens).@Tella1Truth @CurtisJermaine2 @hornets I agree I love that he‚Äôs on our team I just also acknowledge when he flat out sucks lol@panthersfannnn @CurtisJermaine2 @hornets 11 points 4 assists in 14 minutes is awful?@kai_m_h @Josh1232js @hornets I think Bobcat fans just be saying anything, because it's Melo, and he has more fans than the whole franchise. They probably did not even vote for him to be an All Star.He will be out of their hair soon thou, and they will get their team back.@hornets Anyone who still defends james borrego is an idiot. And Michael Jordan will regret in a couple of years when Lamelo leaves that he allowed his star player to be treated like this since the beginning.@SamFarberLive @hornets @jam3s210 Can we please start playing some semblance of defense? 76 points given up at halftime is embarrassing!@kai_m_h @CurtisJermaine2 @hornets He‚Äôll be back strong second half. He looked out of sorts when he got taken out. We need defense. He would‚Äôve been in but Bouk was just playing a bit better@hornets The game is over, no need to play the second half@hornets We played defense for a week and then shitted it out over the weekend@panthersfannnn @hornets lol this was a good first half from him?@Tella1Truth @hornets Some people still in denial about it@Josh1232js @hornets Your team doesn‚Äôt know how to play defense@panthersfannnn @hornets Idk about awfulüòÇ,but he hasn't been playing like himself lately. I wonder if it's because his minutes are not very consistent or he is just in a funk. I still think he needs to be on the floor, unless you just don't believe in him@michael444888 @hornets No comment@Rhe10k @hornets When things are good lamelo is great, but when we are struggling lamelo is too chaotic and leads to more easy points for the other team. I‚Äôm rooting for him next halfWashington's early ejection hurting Hornets on boards and with floor spacing, two areas that were already going to be challenging coming in

Charlotte is doing a good job getting to the line though (15/19; 79%)@panthersfannnn @CurtisJermaine2 @hornets Cuz he‚Äôs the only reason anyone outside of Charlotte watches the hornets.. it‚Äôs not just tonight it‚Äôs in general@NCAArefsgamble @hornets @NBA Thats just not how it works my guy.... Let's say the two los Angeles teams and the two NY teams become really bad for 5 years... you really think the NBA is gonna kick out the teams that generate the most renevue?@Pajita06 @hornets He‚Äôs the reason we ain‚Äôt winning üòÇ can‚Äôt win a game without the man@hornets Geez, absolutely no defense.@Josh1232js @hornets Sorry raptors team? they are literally better than the hornets lmaoTime to regroup.

#AllFly | @hornets https://t.co/BGapnu7eM2@Pajita06 @Josh1232js @hornets He‚Äôs a big reason. Makes us tick@hornets Play some fucking Defense@AlmightyTaka_ @hornets The coach doesn‚Äôt like him we know this already might as well stop complaining about it tbh it is what it is@panthersfannnn @hornets hes one of our best defenders statistically lol and bouknight is horrible on defense@hornets We have another center sitting on bench@nizcomixalt @hornets Seriously. Dude just letting everyone dunk. To his defense he ain‚Äôt a center@ZoWrId @hornets @jam3s210 Terry more trade able.  Gordon is unwantedThe Raptors shot 62% in the first half. 

That‚Äôs the 2nd-highest fg% by an opponent in a half against the Hornets this season. 

Portland shot 64.4% in the first half against Charlotte on 12/17.It‚Äôs amazing that the Charlotte hornets are 25 and 20 and the have worst defense in the league. #nodefense@jamesraps23 @hornets if he has 30@hornets Wow, given up 70 pts by halftime. Awful.@Josh1232js @hornets Hes not the reason we are losingHALFTIME: @Raptors 76, @hornets 61

Pascal Siakam 19 pts, 8 ast, 7 reb
Gary Trent Jr. 15 pts, 2 ast, 6/10 FG

Second half coming up next with @Eric__Smith &amp; @Paul__Jones on the callüìª https://t.co/kGILl37UoU https://t.co/89cjEpF4hd@CurtisJermaine2 @hornets He was playing awful. What do you expect?@CurtisJermaine2 @hornets Cause he‚Äôs been awful‚Ä¶ 0 for his last 11 3‚Äôs, and he lets his guy past him every time on defense. Why should he play more?3 point shooting is the difference so far here in Toronto. 

Charlotte is shooting 65% from 2
Raptors are shooting 63% from 2

@hornets are 78% at the FT line
Toronto is 72% at the FT line

#BuzzCity 4 for 22 from 3 (22%)
Toronto is 10 for 17 from 3 (58%)

CHA down 15 at half.Fight back pls @hornets@hornets These guys are a joke@hornets Don‚Äôt want to hear anyone talk about trading Gordon anymore and his contract. Lmao. Can‚Äôt even beat a sorry raptors team without him@hornets We‚Äôre on pace to score 122 and still lose by 30 lol@hornets You can‚Äôt be serious???@hornets Dont post a picture of Miles "playing defense" he's been getting abused all night w all due respect@hornets Why melo play similar time as plumlee@hornets Borrego likes bouk over lamelo now lol. That‚Äôs what happens when you can‚Äôt play a lick of defense@hornets Just give it to Miles and get out his way@hornets Melo getting Bumlee like minutes. Hate to see it.@hornets @jam3s210 He better than lamelo offensively@hornets they're on pace to score 150 my gosh@hornets Apparently Hayward needs to make $100M a year@ROBERTORAMOSBOA @hornets I‚Äôm sure Charlotte is just chomping at the bit to trade their franchise player‚Ä¶..@hornets Back to playing no defense@hornets Idc if we win or lose, bouk needs to see consistent minutes from here going forward.@GreatScott_11 @hornets Hes a screw up and screws up trying to show boat .. maybe he on drugs@KyleBaileyClub @hornets @Raptors Complete horse crap but moving on. What I want to know is why JB refuses to still play Nick. They are attacking the paint on every play for layups and kick outs. Nick is a legit big body shot blocker who can help. Why not play him?@hornets Toronto just won‚Äôt miss@hornets @jam3s210 Drive it in üëä@hornets @jam3s210 All fly no brainTough finish @MilesBridges!

Charlotte trailing by 15 with 3:16 left in the half.@hornets let‚Äôs close out the half strong get it down to single digits #AllFlyThe Charlotte Hornets used to have one of the hottest sports brands in the 90's. Outside of Chicago Bulls gear you'd see a lot of Hornets jerseys, hats, jackets etc worn for "style". Now their jerseys say "CHA" with a number underneath and it looks like no effort was put into it.@guamtrash @hornets @MELOD1P Whoa whoa we need positivity even though it‚Äôs trueThis is the last time the hornets of Charlotte play with my money@hornets @MELOD1P This team is awful. JB essentially gift wrapped this game with that piss poor lineup. We belong nowhere near the postseason.@ZoWrId @hornets @MELOD1P Ish only plays when team injured when healthy he doesn‚Äôt play@hornets @MELOD1P Bouknight needs Ish minutes respectfullythe @hornets simply have no interest in playing defence@hornets @MELOD1P Miles Bridges is on your basketball team use him@hornets @MELOD1P @Fazolis HAS BOMB WINGS!!! üî•üî•üî• https://t.co/3Gv0OtaMjD@hornets Get on it guys! #AllFlyDamn @hornets came to Scotiabank empty Arena and thought it was scrimmage and no need to play D #Raptors #WeTheNorth@hornets Sorry Stans, but LaMelo has been a liability lately. Shooting poorly and turning the ball over a lot. Hornets need him. Hope he can pick it up quickly.@AFCPasha @camutdforever @hornets I'll just keep reading all the Hornets fans comments about what a stellar fellow PJ is and how shocked everyone is, and who started it. From Hornets fans. Thanks.@hornets Team is trash üóë I can‚Äôt express that enough@hornets argh, my tv doesn't show your game, i wish you luck, comeback is realHornets got to within 8 early in Q2, but Raptors have pushed lead back to 15 (55-40); Charlotte squandering too many advantageous offensive opportunities

#WeTheNorth 
 https://t.co/zrAZuD6DvTRaptors lead 39-27 after one quarter on Charlotte despite 10 free throw attempts for Hornets, zero for Toronto. Three-point shooting matters.1q: #Raptors 39, #Hornets 27

Charlotte is 3-12 from 3PT, continuing its cold shooting.

PJ Washington was ejected.

Other than that things are promising. https://t.co/0cjTXUec0QDirty @Raptors sent a 2-way contract guy to head hunt the @hornets best paint defender in the first corner smh. Both ejected but not like the Raptors lost much. #AllFlyBoth ejected. @Hornets lose PJ, and the @Raptors lose Justin Champagnie. Think Toronto wins that one, as Eric Collins just pointed out. Charlotte already down Hayward and McDaniels, now PJ. Champagnie averages 2 ppg and is on a 2-way contract. https://t.co/PTKnDkbQx5@tradestreetpost @hornets Hayward is more important than most people realize. He steadies the offense when things get out of whack.Pj Man U can‚Äôt afford to be getting ejected you know child support due this week GET YOUR HEAD IN THE GAME #charlottehornets@davidlonderee @hornets Yep.  I was a bit worried when Hayward went down but the impact has been more than I expectedimma need ya to turn it up a lil bit @hornets@tradestreetpost @hornets Man, they‚Äôre struggling these last two games.Try again next game @hornets smh@LOrangeMusic @hornets I know what you mean.
Rule of thumb is when you aren‚Äôt hitting from distance you move in and find your shot‚Ä¶unless you‚Äôre the hornets.  In that case just keep launching üß±@HornetsOnBally @MELOD1P @hornets got fouled a good 2-3 timesLaMelo takes it all the way!
