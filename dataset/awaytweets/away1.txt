Golden State Warriors +3 (-110) 1.1U Each

The Lakers significantly changed the roster this off season after losing in the first round to the Suns. However, I don’t expect them to play good tonight as the chemistry isn’t fully developed.

Coaches want to prioritize their minutes at points where weaker players are in their rotation to make. Ex. Dwight Howard a pivotal part of their offense at certain points of the game.So excited to have the @NBA back today. Can’t wait to see Lebron and his new look @Lakers vs the @warriors tonight!!@OcHimself @NBA @Money23Green @warriors YOU look that shit up.

Plenty of those videos.@overtime @MarkG_Medina I'm a Laker fan but steph will drop 25+, he loves playing against Lebron

I’m hoping for a Golden State-Nets NBA Finals.@BecketDav @riyukdu229 @aceb3yondth3arc @warriors @NBA @Money23Green @KlayThompson @StephenCurry30 KD guaranteed them two more championships, that's different from needing KD.

The Warriors never needed KD in the first place. They went to the finals twice before he joined. They lost in 2016, not because they lacked another superstar, it's because Steph went ice cold.

Don’t sleep on these 2 teams in the west. Never doubt a Ty Lue driven team and for sure never doubt the greatest shooter in history in @StephenCurry30 🤷🏽‍♂️🤷🏽‍♂️ Same way people sleeping on @MiamiHEAT  in the east and @chicagobulls 🤷🏽‍♂️ https://t.co/u2zsN2dAvb@warriors Remember clay, Steph, Green, and all players now are super Star where common players before, so if Figueroa is a good defender why you fucking waive him@honestsportz @warriors Not harden, not KD, nor LeBron is even close to curry’s three point shooting percentage.@ddiop @Quintssential @SynergySST @Raptors @MiamiHEAT @nyknicks @warriors @spurs @SacramentoKings @PelicansNBA @Timberwolves @NBA Inconsistent play on both ends of the court too. Like he was really bad on defence in his second year@honestsportz @warriors He’s the leading three point shooter in the league rn so…@warriors Why what are you doing waiving everyone like nothing are you crazy!
