https://t.co/LcCBBkwPJ5The 76ers would like to get a win at home against the Pistons tomorrow, and Detroit would also like that so much that they have made Cade Cunningham questionable. This is another predetermined game, with the only question being when it gets out of hand. https://t.co/irMJO94rTyGreat spending some time this weekend in Pennsylvania with my good friend Bobby ‚ÄòGonzo‚Äô Gonzalez. Bobby is currently a scout with the Detroit Pistons and was an 11 year NCAA division 1 head coach (18 years total) His teams played tough and were always in great shape. üí™ https://t.co/fVFFWTRco6@Iamboxing rocking the @DetroitPistons gear!!!! #NBATopShotThis #Boxing #DetroitBasketball https://t.co/hTnxYHkX9F@derekbrooks_ @ProPistons @DetroitPistons @Goodguyric @Michael_Aaron @AngryDetroiter @trademarktaz @SmokeeRobinson8 @EscobarFurious @RJ_Hunt36 @BurqueWorldwide Could‚Äôve put something we can see at least lol#Detroit #Pistons: The next &amp; final stop is Philadelphia, PA. ...
