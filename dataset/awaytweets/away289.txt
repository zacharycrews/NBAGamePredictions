Id love to watch but like I say, not willing to change my whole setup for them. Hopefully the @trailblazers will pressure @ROOTSPORTS_NW to actually make some deals next season. And no. Every nationally televised game is blacked out. So dumb.@RedEyeStyle @trailblazers Yeah its really shitty but I had to do something to watch em, also you should be able to watch a few games when they play on TNT (Suns on Dec 14th)@Jacob_Smetak @trailblazers Thats my point. They screwed over thousands if not hundreds of thousands of customers by signing up with a service whos only on obscure services, and apparently makes zero effort to be on more.

Bet money on Portland@trailblazers With all of the rumors &amp; front office issues that have taken place this year, they didn’t blow the team up and rebuild. For that, I’m thankful. Couldn’t bare to see Dame in another jersey. #RipCity all day, everyday.

So to prove him wrong, I tweeted at @CJMcCollum &amp; @Dame_Lillard &amp; CJ immediately responded. My son to this day, 2 yrs later, still thinks him &amp; I are friends lol 🤷‍♂️ https://t.co/bcp25LcdM7My Prediction on tonight Game @warriors vs @trailblazers
