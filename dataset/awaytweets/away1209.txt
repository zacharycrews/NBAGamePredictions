Okay then I have a few questions:

1. If booker is the best, why were the suns never relevant until cp3 arrived?

2. Why does cp3 have better advanced stats like wins shares and bpm?@kirkgoldsberry @celtics @memgrizz @Suns @Raptors @BrooklynNets @warriors @PelicansNBA @chicagobulls @cavs @Lakers The Bulls. https://t.co/TwQyboIp1b@wolf987FM I really don’t think they will win any more games than the Phoenix Suns.

Phoenix Suns will never have anyone win anything individually because the media is weird and we are the Warriors and Lakers rivals https://t.co/NnSXBjekQMPhoenix Suns vs. Utah Jazz 

Jazz hold only a half-game lead over 6th place Denver Nuggets. 

They are trying to avoid dropping down in the standings while facing the No.1 seed in the west.

This pre-playoff game will have the same intensity as a playoff game, it’s one to watch. https://t.co/yE29FSjOTkThis was 4 years ago when @DevinBook missed a game and I still get mad when I don’t see him in the lineup 😂 anyways GameDay!

I'm sick this is how it had to go down but it was the right call even Frank recognizes that I'd imagine.Kylie's glass purse causing some internet buzz ,which is see through just means she's complying with the rules in case she wants to watch Booker play,Phoenix suns are no.1 in their region, last game is coming up soon and is crucial ,it's a family thing guys!😀 https://t.co/BRo0HYwS0k@punyeetttt @Suns @FSKPart3 Elf is active Frank is injured. This has nothing to do with who is better or more valued by the team, only who is available.@meganxbrownx702 @Suns @GoldenKnights If not able to get the Tuch, Debating on either Marchessault or Jack Aces@kaksanca @navajokage @Suns @FSKPart3 He's already not playing until next season, still getting paid, will still get a ring if we win and was only on a 1 year contract so they could literally resign him as soon as free agency hits. Don't get me wrong I love Frank and am super bummed to see him cut, hope he comes back@NBA2K @Suns @celtics @MiamiHEAT @warriors Make trae and Tatum at least a 93@dmglanville @Suns @mikal_bridges Yeah your probably right.#NBANaBand Miami heat x Phoenix Suns@Suns @FSKPart3 I’m good with it. #stillremenberwiscothe @Suns really did @FSKPart3 dirty@KittyKatDeee @CoachEvanB @Suns Pedro31017676 ...

I don’t disagree that the Suns’ record would take a hit. 

But I wonder if we’d see a different level of basketball maturity from LaVine in that environment…@Suns Scottie Pippenesque!!!!@memgrizz Please let’s at least tie the season record… ideally, set a new one. Phoenix Suns did it and we can too.Phoenix Suns waive injured Frank Kaminsky heading into end of regular season https://t.co/tixHbZdgRN via @azcentral@TheRealJoeGonzo @Suns @mikal_bridges He'll start every game to keep his streak alive, but i would guess the last game he doesn't play many minutes.The @PelicansNBA are going to get into the "real" playoffs and give the  @Suns all they can handle #WBD@DickWayne16 @Upbeatmaster_ @Suns Yall got no rings just like the no bitches you have 
Pov suns trophy cabinet https://t.co/MBvlB4LaSK@kray1voice @Suns Absolutely 100%. That truth acknowledged, right move by Suns MGT with the addition of BIYOMBO and than CRAIG. Winning elite teams need a good front office making the right moves at the right time to stay on top. The Suns future on all fronts looks solid. Best luck Frank the Tank.@suns_tutu_fan
