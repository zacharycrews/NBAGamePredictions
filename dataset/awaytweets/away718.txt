https://t.co/HbgR1q2e5JOver 216.5 not cashing in Nuggets-Pistons is a federal crime. Needed 35 4th quarter points and couldn’t get it. The lowest scoring 4th quarter of the entire Denver Nuggets season. Are you kidding me? https://t.co/15bYaweRIQThe Detroit #Pistons(11-36) fall to the Denver #Nuggets(25-21) 110-105. 

Cade Cunningham: 34 points, 8 rebounds, 8 assists, 4 blocks, 2 steals 
Saddiq Bey: 21 points, 3 assists
Hamidou Diallo: 14 points, 5 rebounds
Frank Jackson: 11 pointsNo player in Denver Nuggets history has more than five 20 point/20 rebound games.  Jokic has 4...this season.  Has 8 total. #JokicMVPWhy do the Nets literally have the worst schedule in the NBA? Constant back to backs. Lakers tonight and Denver Nuggets tomorrow? They have to be joking🚨 UPDATE: Nikola Jokic - Denver Nuggets has 21 rebounds
