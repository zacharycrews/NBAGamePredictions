He didn’t single handedly take the Knicks to the playoffs. RJ, IQ, Noels, and Thibs strong defense all played a role. Don’t give him that much credit.@SacramentoKings @hoopculture13 Trade De Aaron Fox to Knicks for Julius Randle and Alec Burks.  Your team already has Halberton and Mitchell at PG.  Think Randle would thrive in Sacremento since not the same pressure like New York.  Randle brings scoring and rebounding.  Fox fills Knicks need for PG.@NBA @nyknicks @Lakers Remember when Julius Randle used to be the featured player on these 😂my new york knicks vs Jade’s la lakers tonight, who will come out on top? https://t.co/pI3Z4ZiETl@CentralPAFAL @NBA_NewYork He’s not a horrible player, but he ain’t the number 1 option.

Westbrook is fit for the Knicks.@nyknicks The Raptors GM fired their 'coach of the year' from the previous year and traded away a player far superior than Randall in DeRozan.

Knicks fans experienced the birth of Linsanity 🌆

What a special moment! https://t.co/erIubpWT1M@nyknicks Trade him for Westbrook pleaseA good attitude is the most underrated quality of a professional athlete. It’s what prevents good players from becoming great players. It’s why Kobe lived by the #MambaMentality.

Randle’s attitude is bad..that should be a good enough reason for the @nyknicks to move on from him.@nyknicks @EvanFourmizz Trade him@GrimeyBarrett @nyknicks The minute they start using him in that way then I’d be cool with it.  But letting him play point forward is not it.@NyFeedz99 @nyknicks @EvanFourmizz I agree. He’s been amazing. Another team would have to make a great offer and then maybeee we’d give him up.@ANT_NYK @nyknicks He’s literally proving he belongs on this team lol. There’s at least 4 guys who should be traded from this team before him. Randle, Noel, Burks, Kemba.@Jukebox3331 @nyknicks @EvanFourmizz Fournier earning his contract now.

Actual comedyit doesn't matter who the nets sign. it doesn't matter who wins regular season games and who flops. new york city will Always belong to the knicks. Always. you can't buy culture. point blank@nyknicks Tibs has to throw the young guys into the fire. Grimes, Obi, Duece, Sims and test Barrett as the playmaker. Love Tibs but he’s running stale rotations wit old vets. Kemba &amp; Randle pack them up in a deal. Randle is not the future and has never been. Rip the bandaid off.Second win in a row for @utahjazz defeating @BrooklynNets 125-102! 
Donovan Mitchell finished with 27 points and Eric Paschall ends with 16 points. 
The Jazz will be facing @nyknicks on Feb 7 at 7 p.m.!
Were you impressed with tonight's performance?@FirstTake @stephenasmith @nyknicks need a new owner.  James Dolan

Let’s talk in 5-6 years from now…@nyknicks Ahh yes, the Knicks once again having to recycle the same Linsanity highlights. What a sad pathetic franchise of losers.
