#AllFly | @CorcoranHM https://t.co/NuLFaAV13C@sweatboxprogram @hornets I think they ain‚Äôt go for him because you probably had to trade terry and pj@AlmightyTaka_ @hornets He was totally misused in Dallas to appease Luka‚Äôs ball hogging. LaMelo would play off Kristaps with much more synergy./r/CharlotteHornets: Any Buyout Market Prospects? #AllFly https://t.co/7Mpm6MqIpK/r/CharlotteHornets: Does Trez start? #AllFly https://t.co/vGuB51xTC6@sweatboxprogram @hornets I think they should‚Äôve done it if you ask me he played a big part in making the mavs hard to beat because I remember luka first year it was a walk in a park to beat them@AlmightyTaka_ @hornets needed shot blocking length and defense. LaMelo would have also made this man reignite his 2017-18 All NBA offense and P&amp;R effectiveness.#GoonSquad @hornets WE BACK!!!! üî•üî•üî•
@MilesBridges @MELOD1P @MONSTATREZZ https://t.co/7yMQwZe4GmIf the Harrell trade and Ish Smith leaving gets Bouknight more playing time for the @hornets I'm good with that.  Especially if it changes Bouknight's body language.  If I'm JB I wouldnt play him either with that perception.  #BeAProI like Trezz to the Hornets too.
