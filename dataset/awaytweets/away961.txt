Tbf, everyone hates this one. Jazz has nothing to do with Utah and the fun culture of Jazz is antithetical to the strict Mormon stereotype of Utah.

Utah has some of the most amazing nature and interesting history. Keeping Jazz was an insult to people from Utah and NO.@KeneAkers Thanks to women like @NBASarah who covers the Utah Jazz I‚Äôve sadly seen how horrible and disgustingly sexist men can be on Twitter towards smart and professional women@christopmarcel @CD12_baller @PacersWRLD @JorOverrated @Lakers @utahjazz @PelicansNBA If zion comes back and is 80% of what he was pelicans will smoke whatever team they face in the play inGot a new tattoo today @utahjazz #takenote https://t.co/KnnzNJ1onZi hate you utah jazzI wonder if they rode to the club in a minivan

Colorway looks like Utah Jazz@D_Fresh2004 @utahjazz Mannnnn dont get me started.  I've been off by one all weekI'll never take the Utah Jazz seriously just because THIS Lakers team beat them niggas convincingly multiple times. They oughta be ashamed and Donovan Mitchell need to be sending them encrypted emails to Pat Riley‚ÄúPaul Millsap, best known for his days with the Utah Jazz‚Äù -Miami Heat broadcast üòêThe food here is DELISH!

Btw while we are on it
2007 Melo won 1 game in playoffs vs 2007 Spurs Nash won 2 Utah Jazz won 1.Bron got swept - couldn't even get you one  
So They weren't as invincible as you think. Harden won 3 vs 2018 Gsw btw@UtahJazzedUp @zachmaxwell07 @utahjazz You don‚Äôt want to see us in the playoffs againNothing to do with the game highlights.  The wristbands were very cool especially during The National Anthem.  Utah Jazz Dunk Team was awesome, Butch even got into the act and he nailed it.  Walk-on Will Burghardts‚Äô3.  The ducks‚Äô shoes sure were purdy and‚Ä¶BRIGHT!
