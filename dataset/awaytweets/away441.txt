But this Jazz team are legit title contenders, and maybe the best bet in terms of return on your money -- their versitle inside/outside offense is excellent.@yuishinron @Obito_1337 @warriors That happens every inbounds play. Smarts feet were moving and it was a clear flop. Refs can’t fall for that nonsense. If it was lebron they wouldn’t call it or it would be a defensive foul on smart@Celtics__Pats @NBA @warriors It was the opposite lol@NBA @warriors Grabbing the refs shoulders when complaining about a call is a tech btw but I guess it only applies to regular players https://t.co/DqNXgJt9GK@ndiaye_szn @WisemanFan @warriors Wiggins didnt do much later half tho@warriors Moses made a block or i'm trippin???@warriors Conquered both gardensAndrew Wiggins, Stephen Curry, &amp; Jayson Tatum all scored 27+ PTS in Golden State’s 111-107 WIN over Boston! 

Wiggins: 27 PTS, 6 REB, 11/20 FGM 
Curry: 30 PTS, 5 REB, 4 AST, 8/21 FGM, 5/14 3PM

The league needs to do something about this problem. It’s getting bad.@Dawitt_K @warriors who cares about these both?@missionarymelo @warriors The dude has been played like this all season.@NBA @warriors Wardell is now 24 for 74 from 3 point land in his last few games 😳🤨🤔
32% is that acceptable for the greatest shooter ever ???@YrnBubba my boys got that W tonight @warriors@Terrbear405 @warriors He's had so many of those this season. I think he is afraid of hard contact and seems to rush them.@AndyP1693 @warriors And at least you're not a Laker fan!  Unlike @EugeneWaters5, who is a friend of mine here in Indy -- and a City and Lakers fan.  How he can get some things right and some so very wrong is a mystery to me!  Love you, Cam!@warriors ANDRE IGUODALA PLAYER OF THE GAME https://t.co/EtQ0RyFNL4@yikes763 @warriors Nope Celtics are just booty@NBA @warriors Draymond is DPOY@WutRWeEvenDoing @warriors @StephenCurry30 Warriors betta than your fav team@Obito_1337 @warriors Are u even watching kd and Giannis or do u just watch curry and think this ? lmao@warriors Every team that plays us plays like it’s game 7 of the Finals.
But for the @warriors — it’s nothing more than an ordinary regular season game@warriors 24-5 nice road win. Terrible officiating in the last second. @Money23Green  got knockdown and they didn't even look at it. But when it's the other way around. For sure green will be hit with a F1@NBA @warriors Beautiful@NBA @warriors nba loves meat riding the warriors@orbit_axis @NBA @warriors yankees and celtics fan? what type of bandwagon are you? lmfao@warriors We moveee 🔥🔥@warriors Iggins Wiggins of Andrew going crazy@Celtics__Pats @NBA @warriors It was the complete opposite lol the Celtics got every call late. The refs haven’t been good for the warriors at all this year they ain’t going to now@warriors Mvp this game besides Steph@warriors Andrew the real MVP@missionarymelo @warriors An KD is getting praise but is never doubled. Even on GSW, the cavs doubled curry 80 times in the finals and only twice on KD@LukeCena_ Nets started the season bad now they on a winning streak and they on fire KD is number 1 in Kia Mvp

So the next time Golden State face the warriors that performance wont happen a again I promise youThe #GoldenStateWarriors have beaten all of their opponents except the #MemphisGrizzlies. 
Their losses came from the opponents they have played twice.

still, i like seeing him on court, he's doing great defense.Boston was having Freedom drop way off Iguodala when he was running the Warriors offense. Golden State took the ball out of Iguodala's hands and had him work as a screener and on the short-roll and now they are shredding Boston's defense.he wiggin out @22wiggins @warriors
