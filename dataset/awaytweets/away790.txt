Morris has missed nearly 3 months since his altercation with Nikola Jokic. https://t.co/Qo7TEh5zXQ@tbl_lancewinnz @Odell2MyRams @DomDolla22 I’m not just talking bout him, Lebron don’t play defense and ad is not same, tht is just bad, melo haven’t shot like he was Portland for 2 yrs and Ariza haven’t set up like he was good in Miami heat last years, why u are target russ?@Three_Cone Miami Heat and Bubble@GregSylvander @MiamiHEAT @WaterCleanupFL Duncan should come off the bench. I think it’s a better role for him. Have Struss starting. He’s more aggressive and goes to the boards. Dunks and isn’t afraid.  And he can also drain threes.Making his 15th #NBAAllstar  appearance… Duncan Robinson of the @MiamiHEAT! 

Duncan is averaging 35 PPG, 17.6 RPG and 12.3 APG this season.@BallyHEAT @MiamiHEAT Haven't we got like two more road games after this one? 😂NBA Game of the Night
