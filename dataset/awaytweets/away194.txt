https://t.co/e4rCxvTum2Deandre Ayton (leg) OUT tonight, but getting in pregame work. 

Monty Williams said conditioning is key in Ayton's return as he's missed five of #Suns last six games (4 straight).

Phoenix conclude 3-game road trip tomorrow at Minnesota. Suns 5-0 w/o Ayton. On 7-game win streak. https://t.co/kUKaiDIAc7If you need better TV...

Towns plays with his Buddy Book in a winning team where the pressures off to be the face. He can just ball out and rest his mind 🙏🏼

And the darkness is the night

Phoenix rises from the ash
Brand new sun paints the dark sky
And it does it in a flash

I was told-
she is a melancholy soul.

the flicker of a candle blown.

A lonely kite
lost in flight
someone once had flown.
