As a whole on the year, yes, the team has been very impressive even when taking schedule into account@ClaytonRWalker @memgrizz It's alright, no need to apologize. I get that losers normally act that way. ✌️@Zazuceee @MikeGrabman @Jumpshot8 @JohnEhrenfeld @NBA @Suns @warriors @Bulls @nets @Bucks @memgrizz You don't think the team success would still be there if Jonas was on the team?   They were already a playoff team last year, you think Adams is the reason they made the leap?

On @GrizzOnBally 📺 https://t.co/RUct7ea58qBrooklyn Nets vs Memphis Grizzlies should be a great game tonight. The Nets beat alot of BS teams. The Grizzlies are hot.The surging @memgrizz are riding @JaMorant's momentum into a showdown against the @BrooklynNets. Even if the 4-game win streak falls by the wayside, @Covers_Caley is confident the Grizz will keep things within the 6.5-point spread in his NBA betting picks.
