Darrell Walker was the 12th pick of the @nyknicks in 1983 while Philander Smith's Todd Day was the 8th overall pick of the @Bucks in 1992.

#LittleRocksTeam https://t.co/NyTFXM48hU📅 On this day in 1971, the @Bucks Kareem Abdul-Jabbar scored a career-high 55 points and added 17 rebounds in a 120-104 win over the Celtics.

Abdul-Jabbar finished with a career-best 2,822 points that season, at the time the fifth-highest total in NBA history (he's now ninth). https://t.co/nTtokwoycs@Bucks Hey admin, Im a huge fan of the bucks and I turn 17 today. Could I get a happy birthday reply?Today's NBA Consensus (So Far):

Read more about it in our blog 👉 https://t.co/bqOvh0tMJB https://t.co/JwhOl3kTnC@WilwaukeeWucks @Bucks I liked that Portland trade cuz the additions of Allen and Wes have made Pat &amp; Donte sorta redundant players. Nance and Smith both give the team something different. Nance size &amp; toughness, Smith speed and ball handling &amp; both can hit the 3. Plus, can MIL even extend Donte?@BPortistuga @Billy67387311 @RaTeD_RMN @Heat4life01 @Bucks Yeah, I remember those guppies, they went in and beat the 1st Place Bucks 4-2 in the second round after going 56-17, LMAO, Poverty Franchise, that ring will be the only ring you ever get as long as your team keeps losing to teams like Toronto, Boston and even San Antonio💀💀💀 https://t.co/gKw5yTLxpE@SepehrEskandar1 @Bucks I was looking at the Pacers roster and nothing seemed to fit. The most desirable piece for the Bucks would be Turner, but that ain't happening. Indiana is probably looking for expiring contracts, something the Bucks don't have. A deal with them would likely require a 3rd team.The biggest climber in week 6 was done by the @Bucks  as they climb 7 spots to #7.

And the team dropping the most is the @LAClippers dropping 8 spots to #16.
