Seems to me he's getting valuable development time taken away, and is very capable of playing the position. We should have never resigned him.DET +9.5

Wow I hate betting on the Pistons and betting against Dame. But Detroit is a better ATS team than Portland and have been 4-1 ATS in their last 5 while Blazers are 1-4.@KenKalDRW @DetroitRedWings @NHLBruins @971theticketxyt @DetroitPistons @PORTrailBlazers @nbamark We need it! https://t.co/59O5ithGSM18. Bad Bad Hats (@BadBadHats) - "Detroit Basketball" - Hated choosing between this &amp; "Walkman," but it captured my heart first. BBH have really fine-tuned their pop approach. One critique: If 'New Girl' taught us anything, it's not to date a Pistons fan.
