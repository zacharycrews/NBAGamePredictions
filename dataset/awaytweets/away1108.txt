Chicago Bulls vs Cleveland Cavaliers LIVE REACTION/Play-By-Play https://t.co/boFRlLcv7U via @YouTubeCleveland Cavaliers - Chicago Bulls

4 odd üçÄü§û https://t.co/mTHf43vvBz@chicagobulls @FirstAlert I feel like this lineup brings the best defense/offense ratio we‚Äôve been needing recently. Back court can handle getting over screens as long as communicate &amp; we can rely on Zach/Demar to score whilst finding big Vooch down low when switch is right12am here in UK

Means only one thing, @chicagobulls are about to play their biggest game of the season

We got this!!!
