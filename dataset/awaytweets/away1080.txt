Zach LaVine has Chicago's last 6 points. He has gotten to the hoop quite a bit tonight, though he just started heating up a bit. He has 16 points.This is the Chicago Bulls that I have missed dearly. GREAT EFFORT. üôåüèª #bullsnationHella good game!!! @chicagobullsLet‚Äôs go @chicagobulls!!!LeBron and the Lakers do the Raptors a solid and knock off the Cavs. With a win over Chicago tonight, Toronto would move back into a tie for 6th and pull within a half-game of the Bulls for 5th. A lot at stake ahead of Thursday's Raps-Cavs showdown.Cleveland has lost in Los Angeles
Now, if Chicago wins in Toronto and Washington loses to Houston, the Bulls would be the 12th team (5th from the East) to mathematically secure the postseason. https://t.co/1SlkKBZNqh@chicagobulls I‚Äôm late but üëÄüî¥ALERT: New high roller bet posted!
