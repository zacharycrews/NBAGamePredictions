And so you get your contract depending on what they think you can offer for them, depending on what youve shown, or the potential they see in you. These are 2 ttlly different systms for a reasonI was never on. Just a fan since they were tbe San Francisco Warriors before changing their name to Golden State.

Better to slump now then later on. Health plays major factor as well. Klay still trying to figure himself and guys he's never really played with before. Dray is hurt. It's just 1 loss.

An offense like this where you aren't able to generate good looks even with teams selling out on Curry is NOT going to get it done in the playoffs.@PabzSantos30 @warriors hell noThe Golden State Warriors have too many mouths to feed.

 #GoldenStateWarriors@warriors So far, it hasn't been a good month for the GSW.  They need to correct this ASAP.Warriors star Stephen Curry talks about what Golden State needs to do to get back on the winning track.

That’s childish. The team you see is either going to have to do it or not. James Wiseman sounds like a deep bench asset at this point.@ramon_rican @warriors Praying for a Wiseman comeback 🙏@AnkLe_BrEakEr56 @TrolledByPG @warriors Most likely, but considering he a clippers fan I wouldn’t blame him paying more attention to other teams than his own team lmao@haileyaleah2 @warriors @SteveKerr @StephenCurry30 @Loon_Rebel5 @juanonjuan10 @NemanjaBjelica @Chiozza11 @andre @Dami0nLee @22wiggins I would agree and disagree at the same time, cuz our guys don’t even get motivation from encouragements, prolly throwin hate and slander at them gonna motivate them more. 😂@IsaiahR65362620 @warriors Thats why I like Jakob. He’s a good rebounder he averages 4 offensive and 4 defensive (8 total) rebounds in a game and he’s a great low post defender.

If SC is leading the reb. Dept. then this team has a big problem. Dray won’t fix this.

Milwaukee - 118
Golden State - 99@warriors Not subbing in the starters down 18 with 10 minutes left after those Giannis free throws was one of the worst subbing decisions I've seen from Steve Kerr.

- play kuminga more 
- pls pls get curry on ball, why play curry off ball when he’s so predictable nowadays
- defense win offense, need to be more aggresive with energy defending zach and derozan
- hit shotsCan't wait to hear the excuses from @FirstTake @ESPNNBA after the @Bucks beat the brakes off of the @warriors@warriors Can’t believe I’m saying this, but Andrew Wiggins NEEDS some HELP🤦🏻‍♂️@warriors Thatz why I tweeted #DUBBIT all those times.

They’ve been playing like shit for the past month and still won’t have Draymond for defense. They’ll probably lose just as badly to them as they did the Bucks. Hate saying it but they’re playing just as badly as they did in 2019 just with an updated roster.@yeezysosa @warriors Lol y’all good@warriors oh really! had no idea@LaVineeGotNext @warriors u mean 3 national titles@warriors I’m still waiting for Steph to show up in a big game. No way this shit should be happening with this much talent on the team.

I mean, I kind of expected this as Golden State didn’t have a body big enough in height or strength available to stop Giannis, as he led MIL to a 118-99 home W #NBA @Bucks @warriors@warriors We have to make trades … our bench not it no more@warriors Will get them back on 3/12. Full strength Warriors!@warriors Im scared to watch tomorrow.@warriors LOL stop off-ball steph cmon

It would be very sad to see this happen.@warriors Fraud Kerr still thinks washed iggy jta and belly are better than Kuminga 🤣@Logan_evans_04 @warriors -meat riding a grown man 😭@missionarymelo @warriors This coach pisses me off sometimes istg@ryannwong25 @warriors Klay not even playing full minutes yet@warriors stop tweeting and make sure we dont lose by 20 again tomorrow@warriors As an honest Stephen Curry fan I can honestly say: he isn’t the MVP, he’s not even top 5, he’s a borderline all star Just like Steph the Warriors have unfortunately fallen off. All this shows that: LAKERS RUN THE LEAGUE 🔥🔥🔥 LeBron still the best in the league and the MVP💯💯💯@warriors play kuminga over the others you were planning on playing@warriors Good game for Kum Bucket@warriors Always cold...@warriors I didn't expect this actually like they actually caught up. But still wer down by 19. Still, thanks for your hardwork. Please win Bulls tomorrow.@baby_face_goat @therealselena23 @hayescarroll_ @warriors bro i'd take a g league bench warmer at this current moment over him@warriors It’s fine guys we’ll not really but being frustrated about it being about isn’t gonna help2nd straight loss @warriors keep that shittttt uppp 😒@warriors The “Splash Bros” were dangerous tonight 🔥

This proves Draymond is the real reason why the Warriors are good 🤫@warriors Change needs to happen and fast starting with looney@warriors you almost for get this team used to be so good but its like they cant do anything right anymore...guess in an 80 something season, slumps are expected but for the warriors draymond doesnt play and its like they cant get out of their own way...@amer_dubzz @warriors Are you from UK too?@warriors Just tell us the score of tomorrows game@warriors WHEN WILL IT BE OUR NIGHT?? THESE ROTATIONS AREN'T WORKING, WE NEED TO FIGURE OUT OUR OFFENSE EVEN W/O DRAYMOND🤔@warriors Bro what are we doing 🤦🏻‍♂️@warriors Tell Kerr to fuck off@warriors Hasn’t been our road trip!@warriors Warriors will have to get Kuminga to take on Giannis next game.
#kumingod is the future @JonathanKuming6 👏 👏 👏 👏 👏 👏@warriors We need myers to sign another serviceable big that can put rim pressure and keep defenses honest. When the threes are not falling we have no backup plan and it’s not a sustainable strategy if u want to win in the playoffs…Half way through the season the @warriors are (30-11) after the 118-99 drubbing at the hands of the @Bucks. #DubNation out scores Milwaukee 61-41 in second half, but was outscored 77-38 in first half. Giannis led all scorers with a 30pt triple-double (12r, 11a).@therealselena23 @warriors Lakers Lost to the Sacramento king@warriors Hey, no toxicity from this Bucks fan. GGs 🤝🤝 best of luck, hoping to see you again this postseason 🙏🏼@warriors Kuminga is one of the best defenders on this team then kerr didn't even try him on giannis in the 1st half@warriors Who sold@warriors Giannis is a better pg than steph, better playmaker and has more gravity@warriors Please tell Kerr to figure shit out@warriors Kuminga should start tomorrow honestly he was the best player for us tonight don’t care if he didn’t shoot great he’s a rook@warriors I can’t take this anymore https://t.co/STpSw0hqff@warriors We need a coaching change that was embarrassing the team looked lost from the tip off and Lee/JTA were out there way too much, not to mention how many lay ups were given up for contested 3s 🤦‍♂️@warriors Trade curry I’m begging@warriors @StephenCurry30 The only MVP to get blowout 15 times or more Curry@warriors Why tf is steph and the best not on the floor dumbass Kerr ya had a chance this rotations are so bad stop letting curry play offball ffs I’m done with my life@warriors LMAOOOOOO@warriors Looks like we don’t want to win I guess@CocchiaraSam @warriors They didn’t lose by 20@warriors Warriors players last 21 games https://t.co/3u6Eox2Pa4O portland de Anfernee Simons ganharia tranquilamente desse Golden State Warriors@warriors Are you not.

But let’s be honest, they haven’t played a good game since New Years. The whole team can’t shoot, Curry looks like a rookie &amp; Bjelica thinks he’s Kobe but can’t make a shot and is taking minutes that Kuminga deservesDamn @warriors don’t get beat like this #NBAonTNTMy goodness! @Bucks say slow all the @warriors championship talk. Statement game.@warriors @NBCSAuthentic WHY DONT YOU LET HIM PLAY MOREthe whole of the golden state warriors trash tonight@warriors put Klay back in for some garbage time buckets you bums, Giannis stomping on y’allI’m 2/2 when seeing @warriors in person that @StephenCurry30 and @KlayThompson sit the fourth quarter 💔😭 #pain #DubNation 

At least I have these great pictures 🤩 https://t.co/pa0FrXrTn5@warriors @NBCSAuthentic This match is the perfect example of how useless @StephenCurry30 is without @Money23Green . He's -25 ffs.But I gotta stick with the @warriors. Thru the good times and the bad.Very technical action of Kuminga. @warriors 💙💛@goatpcks @warriors I did! Thought it was a coin toss of a game so I took them as underdogs for the value.@warriors @NBCSAuthentic Lee and chiozza are not champions mental people they play for fun not to compete watch how they play like street basketballWarriors should let go of Damion Lee and Chiozza and get some front court! @warriors @WarriorsPR @SteveKerr@Neymar10wrld @warriors @NBCSAuthentic Kerr needs to go 100%@PythonBro @warriors @NBCSAuthentic It is understandable in Thompson situation since he just recently returned from his injury.@DogSurfRoadshow @warriors You gotta have shooters that can shoot, i was kinda waiting like ok 18 point game but warriors don't have elite shooters like klay and stephThe @warriors will be just fine and so do @StephenCurry30. Every team and players go through highs and lows. They will peak at the right time. But could not understand @Giannis_An34 still remaining on floor upto midway 4th , chasing stats or still fear a comeback? 😆 #NBA@DogSurfRoadshow @warriors he is a G league guy.....a legit back-up point guard is the teams biggest need. Poole is a 2 and the combo of 37 year old Iggy and Chiozza and Dlee is subpar. Perhaps they should give Moody a shot since he can defend a bit and catch &amp; shoot proficiently@statmuse I CAN'T WATCH THIS SHIT

Remember in 2019 Klay couldn’t hit a 3 for like a month? We just aren’t used to seeing this from curry but he will be back eventually.@warriors @NBCSAuthentic it is shit gameQuestion: When I come to see the @warriors in person, specifically for  @StephenCurry30 and @KlayThompson, why does Golden State always lose and my two favorite players get pulled in the 4th quarter? 💔 #DubNation@warriors are just hype in Klay's return and play out of rhythm.

Regroup and be locked in. 🔜@warriors @NBCSAuthentic https://t.co/uLhBwRKPQf is this really ?? Lol@cin_d25 @warriors Just be glad you missed the first half, not that the 2nd half has been spectacular but still@warriors @NBCSAuthentic KUMINGA NEEDS MORE GOD DAMN MINUTESSigh missing all these wide open shots @warriors@warriors why is Lee allowed to bring this team down he’s -20 bricking wide bricking wide open shots???? Are the coaches watching the game? Is there any sort of game plan?There is nice drive by Jordan Nwora.
I’m just a big Nwora fan. Celebrate His entire catalog. He is like Tony Snell to @SnellSZN

#baskettips #basketprediction #basketballbets #nba #usabasketI’m done with Chiozza, I honestly thought the @warriors had a small albeit realistic possibility of coming back since an 18 point deficit for this team really isn’t that much but Chiozza just doesn’t cut it.@iam_bigvine @Neymar10wrld @warriors @NBCSAuthentic It's a bot, don't fall for it.@jaggoseong @warriors @neymarjr jokic- vencedor do mvp ganhando do curry KKK@CjLafferty @warriors Def will be lol they’ve been this entire road trip@Neymar10wrld @warriors @NBCSAuthentic I was pissed, thanks for making me laugh 😭@Ali_Szn14 @warriors @NBCSAuthentic He is better in defense i mean..@warriors @NBCSAuthentic cut lee, jta and iggy. they literally do nothing to help the teamDubs were on a 17-4 run to try to make this respectable and maybe even make a miracle come back.

- Curry is overrated and can’t defend
- Draymond can’t score
- Wiggins a walking brick
- Klay is old and washed
- Poole/Lee/JTA/GP2 will fall off when Klay returns 
- I only speak facts 🤷‍♀️🤷‍♀️🤷‍♀️

Most overrated team in league 🤣🤣🤣@warriors @NBCSAuthentic y’all are not serious right now@warriors @NBCSAuthentic please no tweets until we have the lead@warriors @NBCSAuthentic Scoreboard lil bro@warriors @NBCSAuthentic Maybe use him more except for when you're down by 40 points@warriors @NBCSAuthentic Stop@GoIdenState @warriors they not trynna get cooked🤣@warriors @NBCSAuthentic watching this train wreck like https://t.co/tPmR4HLo2J@warriors @NBCSAuthentic Best player on the team@warriors @NBCSAuthentic We don't care@warriors @NBCSAuthentic do not tweet again@warriors @NBCSAuthentic you’re down 30😂@Hazzamorgs_14 @Official_JaY7 @KawhiGotNext_ @warriors @NBCSAuthentic Rn my points getting proved, the Warriors are balling out rn because there finally making open shots@warriors @NBCSAuthentic Our best player@warriors @NBCSAuthentic HAVE SOME SHAME💀@warriors ...

Mo Bamba can probably be had for a (small?) price... and a Sabonis trade gives you one of the best passing post duos ever(and he REBOUNDS).

Dubs need to be able to manufacture easy buckets down low when the going gets tough.  Too one dimensional right now...I think its high time JO'KUM gets more play time for the golden state warriorsLets go @warriors  😊#GSWvsMILKuminga lookin nice Freal tho. @warriorsKuminga makes a great dunk. Our player from Congo. @warriors💙💛@isnothere93 @LFC @warriors lefraud mentalitymidgetGet 5 stops and score on the other end we right back @warriorsFIRE STEVE KERR PLEASE @warriorsfuck u @warriors piece of shit https://t.co/fbFLYocH6o@warriors You should be ashame of@yourself in a slump like this! Your MVP campaign is done because you look Lackadaisical smfh@DrLuap @ladysmiles3 @warriors gotta be bored lolThe 3rd Quarter is improved for the Golden State Warriors but they'll need more push for the 4th Quarter.

#GSWvsMIL https://t.co/qkn05QsKxM@whosthtguy20 @warriors I really wish I knew@greglacob @warriors Going to need one of those 37 point Klay quarters@warriors  1-5 since this tweet  #GSWvsMIL loool #DubNation https://t.co/TIBVE5BmaG@warriors Come gametime it’s brick central lolThe 39 point deficit at the half was the worst in @warriors history since they moved to California.

The optimistic news is that the deficit’s cut to 25 with a quarter to go. 😂@GrantLiffmann Warriors need a play maker aside from Dray and Ben Simmons is the one. Ben can do screens too for Curry and Klay... @warriors need to trade Wiggins and Wiseman@warriors Fan. The problem here is not the players. If you're a great coach and you see your players is hurting the game you will take them out of the game right?  But Steve kerr is different. He will sub out the player who is giving them a points, ironic right?@skiptomylou30 Yeah... Let's give them these loses coz they gave us more wins right? 💙💛

I am a true @warriors so win or lose, no judgement and no trash talking to anyone from the team 

#DubNation since 2014@draymondGOAT @warriors Trying brotha ): it got ugly fast, tough to come backGolden State Warriors getting their 4th Straight loss and tomorrow they are headed to Chicago 🤣🤣🤣🤣@warriors what is going on tonight ? 😭😵‍💫@warriors You should be ashamed yo self playing like that!@statmuse @warriors @WarriorsPR No way.End of Q3 👀

It was 29-7 over previous 36.Ion wanna talk bout my team’s effort tonight 🤦🏽‍♀️ @warriors@sean_jazayeri @warriors You’re forgetting #KlayDay but it’s been shitty lately no denying that. #DubNation is spoiled since there are at least 25 fan bases out there who would swap places with us immediately. For some reason this @warriors team always struggles during the dog days of the schedule.#Milwaukee Bucks - Golden State Warriors ★ #2º cuarto terminado: 77 - 38 ★ by: #SofaScore RT &amp; FW Please...This is kinda not poggers @warriors@AndraLThomas1 @warriors @NBCSAuthentic Oh Steph is one big reason tho. You can’t expect your star shooter to play like ass on a regular basis, get absolutely nothing done for two quarters and suddenly remember how to play hoop in the last. If one player’s (dray) does this, we better forget about the championship rnRemember the Golden State Warriors? This is them now: https://t.co/uy0ya4igfx@warriors @StephenCurry30 come on curryWell at least the @warriors won the 3rd Quarter@wscdub @warriors @SteveKerr perfectly describing how i feel rn@warriors @StephenCurry30 …what the hell’s been going on though? Good for the milestone stuff but he’s have a shitty couple of months.Before the season started I said: "The @Warriors need a good center that can take on tall teams" Today the @Bucks have shown that @Kevonlooney05 IS NOT that center that the @warriors need. @SteveKerr https://t.co/iuAhXUwAhE@NBA @warriors He looks better in the game.  😬😬RT Bill_Michaels "I know that the @NBA is a league of "runs"...but WOW...the @Bucks are steamrolling the @warriors

He moves like a 40 yr old wit hurt knees. @warriors #DubNation@warriors @KlayThompson Maybe Steph needs goggles: he is only making FT's at this point and it has become BRUTAL!
#hardtowatchthegreatestshootershootpoorlyWhy is Curry posting on the block and shooting turn around fadeaways? @warriorsAs bad as this @warriors game is the worst part is they have one tomorrow in the CHI !!! 🏀🏀Damn do you see the score @warriors@statmuse @warriors @WarriorsPR Ikr! #AndrewWiggins deserves to be an #NBAAllStar@JayzSteel07 @warriors Yes, he sucks.

This is a serious inquiry.  Why is he off?@NBAonTNT @warriors @Bucks Giannis spanking their asses@warriors I know Wiseman is hurt but sometimes you have to play size against grown man.. Bjelica vs Portis and let Wiggins, Iggy and Porter take turns at Giannis.. Kumminga and Klay on Middleton he does have young strength.. you have to matchup against the good teams.how the fuck steve kerr still a coach?  Because of the accolades the he have?  Can you give me a reason? Because They only win when curry play onball and the bench step up.

DamnHELLO???? @warriorsIt's because @Money23Green isn't playing.  @warriors missing the 40 he normally provides. https://t.co/jIlIcXwIk5The Bucks actually doubled the Warriors’ score 77-38 at the half and Giannis is absolutely dominating them with already 23/7/7 on 9-12 shooting.

Golden State’s No. 1 ranked defense has had no answer for Giannis. He’s just unstoppable. #MVP

Whoever did that is suuuuuch an idiot LOOOL 🤣🤣...😭😭...🤡🤡Golden State Warriors...😳😳😳You know I love my @warriors but I'm seeing two things. One, ya'll need a back-up Draymond Green. You need to plan for the possibility of him getting hurt. He's not 25 anymore. And two, I love Klay, but it seems like him being in the rotation is screwing with their mojo.@Hazzamorgs_14 @Official_JaY7 @KawhiGotNext_ @warriors @NBCSAuthentic Everything I just said was referring to this game…Draymond Green isn’t playing and the Warriors are missing everything, there 5-28 on 3s, most being wide open@warriors @StephenCurry30 Getting blown out on national tv. 0 votes@fcbjosee @warriors But but but no Draymond + Gary Payton got hurt 🥺@antonin_org Its suffocating to see @warriors play a non warriors brand of basketball.

PASS THE STICKS @warriors@warriors why yall gotta trick me into thinking ur good 🥲@warriors @NBCSAuthentic What’s happening to us😭💔This is not an overreaction.

The Warriors have been outclassed (by leaps and bounds) the past couple of weeks.  That is a realistic appraisal of their play. 

Even with Draymond out, they aren't playing good basketball...

@warriors  aren't competing...

#DubNation@warriors yall suck tell kerr to make some adjustments jesus christ42-0 run to start the 3rd or you're frauds @warriors@ballinbino @warriors He couldn’t keep up the pace he was on he was bound to go through a slump.

#Warriors #Bucks  #GiannisAntetokounmpo #Curry #NBAAllStar https://t.co/KIjouXNB5to finado golden state warriors@StephenCurry30 take over this game. The coaching staff is lost. The coach needs to forego @KlayThompson minutes restriction and get back in this game. Let’s go @warriors !!!@WarriorsPR @warriors Let’s get it over with. These guys aren’t GonNa win a championship, they’re not gonNA play, and if they can’t win with a strong team, how about the warriors managementMan. Praying 🙏🏾 the @warriors can find their game in the second half and that all their shots start dropping in the basket.@Ao1ky6 @missionarymelo @warriors @NBCSAuthentic sit back, relax, and watch how bad JTA and D lee areWarriors: 3 Trades the Golden State #Warriors Should Consider Making to Solidify Their Championship ... https://t.co/ERrfHUduN3@warriors @NBCSAuthentic Make it to 15-14 Lead and make a run 3rd Quarter@WarriorsPR @warriors Unfortunately, Curry said nothing to worry about the losses since it is ‘just’ the regular season. They probably forgot that losing becomes a habit. Hope come playoffs, they can remember how to win.@WarriorsPR @warriors HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH Y'ALL PLAYING LIKE FUCKIN WESTBROOK LMFAO@ItzShawn_YT @Bucks @warriors Grayson Allen@Jagdev77 @BontaHill @warriors have actually taken more shots than the Bucks…it’s a make or miss league &amp; right now the Dubs are ice cold.@warriors @StephenCurry30 We need a new KD@coolninja831 @warriors @NBCSAuthentic Also for the fact we haven’t been good recently the last month@DogSurfRoadshow @SteveKerr @warriors you think they should abandon the offense they've been practicing for years and run a bunch of pick and rolls against a team with the second most versatile interior defender in the league?@NBAonTNT @warriors @Bucks Why is this game blackout in Los Angeles? @NBA I have NBA league pass and can’t even watch it there.How the @warriors down 30 rn against the @Bucks idk!turning this mf off it's a shame @warriors@coolninja831 @warriors @NBCSAuthentic Nobody can’t stop Giannis but they got 60 points and we have 30 I think a high school team does better@warriors Dwight Howard is available just letting you know, I couldn’t care lessTrade the kids and get a proper rim protector @warriors@warriors Humiliation in progress  😠 @warriorsAt some point @warriors will break out of this slump. Doesn't make it less stressful having to watch this trainwreck right now@KlaymondCurry30 @warriors @NBCSAuthentic Yeah I understand that. But what I mean, because of the double triple team made by Curry's gravity, his teammates can make shots out of it, which painful to watch. I hope kerr will change is play, and make steph is the primary ball handler, specifically if dray isn't playing.@warriors @NBCSAuthentic Kerr just likes to use those who are not talented or inexperienced to suppress someone and balance the team, so that he is able to show he's right?. Why put Stephen on bench again when Stephen is hot?@Bill_Michaels @NBA @Bucks @warriors A plus 30 half is not a run it’s a beat down.  They get up for the teams they are supposed to just to let everyone know they are the best team.Somebody let me know when the @warriors reqdy to hoop again these past few games boys playing scared it’s ugly to watchSome @Bucks and @warriors basketball on this Thursday night 🏀 #FearTheDeer https://t.co/e4jrWpFyZC@WarriorsPR @warriors Oh great now jta gets minutes lol fuck that@warriors @NBCSAuthentic only down by thirty now https://t.co/3x4OdcKWLl@warriors Can’t win with this small line up..Playing LUCKY is not here all the time Warriors!!😂@mf_maurino @warriors This a very stupid question to ask@DogSurfRoadshow @Loon_Rebel5 @warriors I concur lolhahaha funny @warriors@Bthomps0n_ @warriors Steph sorry@warriors no no calls. No 50-50 balls. No foul calls in favor. Everything rimming in and out. If the #Bucks blow this insane luck game it will be the worst give away in the last 5 years in the #NBA. 

#GoWarriors? #warriors #gswDamn, #MilwaukeeBucks beating the brakes off the @warriors. 🥴@TheYoungEstBos1 @warriors @Bucks I hope so cause money look gone from my view@warriors wtf is going on with y’all latelyThe Golden State warriors need to package a trade for Ben Simmons. They need him.@warriors @NBCSAuthentic Something happened. Not sure what but teams don't forget how to play and teams don't just go bad. This is a long stretch. It's not just Steph. The energy is off. Whatever it is, hope it's identified and dealt with soon.🏀💪🏾👟In collaboration with @BallsackSports and the @warriors, the Nutsack Network is releasing its first of many NFTs.

We're getting blown outDisgusting @warriors@WarriorsPR @warriors This would be their greatest comeback of the season. They really do have more issues to fix than injuries. And as I mentioned before their #1 defensive efficiency is deceptive as their defense does not pass the eye test. No big man cause it to break down.#StephenCurry's #Warriors face the #Bucks. Curry poured in 41 points to help #GoldenState slip past #Milwaukee 122-121 on April 6, 2021. However, the Bucks would score the last laugh that season, ending a 50-year title drought in July.

The shot selection’s garbage and the defense is giving up endless wide fucking open shots.shut it down @warriorsThey jus said @warriors 1st in defense ratings 😂@Chick_hens @warriors @NBCSAuthentic I don’t think people understand how hard it is for curry to get an open shot.@warriors y’all gettin yall ass whooped I don’t appreciate it.@warriors desperately need @Money23Green backDamn so @GetSpectrum won’t let me watch the @NBAonTNT game between the @warriors &amp; the @Bucks ?

Why can’t I watch @Bucks and @warriors in LA.
@Ask_Spectrum says it’s not their fault (of course they do)How tf are u guys the number 1 defensive team in the league SMH @warriors@warriors We need Draymond and Wiseman to be able to match up with this guys. The coach is just making steph to work beyond normal with all these trash players on the court with him@favoritewcw1 @warriors I totally agree. He moves the ball around. Plus he is great defender. We are struggling on both endsDamn @warriors we need u @Money23GreenCome on Golden State Warriors💛💙@WarriorsPR @warriors Getting blown out by 40Attack the paint please @warriors you are missing and missing 3 pts shoot and you keep doing the same. Go to the paint, change the strategy @SteveKerr @StephenCurry30. Guys come on 🤦🏻‍♂️@warriors @NBCSAuthentic CurryDotFraud looking rough out there 🤣@warriors @NBCSAuthentic Time to play all the rookies and sub, as many time as they have come back , not today the way they are playing. Poor subscription. Iguodala 10 mins in first WHATTired of tuning in the @Warriors and watching them miss open three-pointers. 😝@warriors @NBCSAuthentic wtf bjelica is shooting 3's broCan we get a backup center @warriorsThis is bad no shooting to much turn overs no sense of urgency @warriors@goldenstateover @StorkEighty3 @Migwell1231 @warriors Currys always been like that. When he's struggling he slumps his shoulders doesn't get back on d. Yet, when he's shooting well he's jumping around laughing. Just more noticeable since he's struggled for a month now@warriors you guys are playing trashPortis is cooking this team...why? @Warriors@warriors @SteveKerr @StephenCurry30 Wake up warriors...!!! It seems, that they are drunk..!!!@Jpeaboo @warriors @NBCSAuthentic Facts@WarriorsPR @warriors Poor young glove so sad@missionarymelo @warriors @NBCSAuthentic Midd is cooking kum bucket.

We’ll see how it works out. @warriors https://t.co/TXOJqduOlo@WarriorsPR @warriors Bjelica shooting 3's 3 possesions wtfGolden State's Gary Payton II is out for rest of game with lower back tightness #warriors #bucksThese @warriors don’t look hungry anymore. Can see it in body language. They use to pride themselves in defense. Get that back and the shots will come.Golden State Warriors standing around on the Bucks court with their thumbs up their asses on their way to getting blown out by 40+ points by the Bucks! Nasty! Top team in league!!?? Ya right I say BULLSHIT!@warriors @NBCSAuthentic this makes me not wanna watch basketball anymore.This is bad, big mountain to climb to get back in this one but idk @warriorsThe L was almost guaranteed without Dray but this ain't even watchable. Kinda embarrassed to be a @warriors fan at the momentGolden State’s lack of size is killing them tonight. Giannis with 13 and the Warriors are down 48-24 early in the second quarter.@warriors Tuff fit@WarriorsPR @warriors It’s hard to watch whole game@WarriorsPR @warriors Feel better 💪🏾Yall know that there's a game of basketball to be played right ? @warriors@WarriorsPR @warriors They are actually not ‘finding’ their identity as Kerr had said. They are actually losing it big time. Taking out Curry, Klay and Wiggins at the same time and let Poole and Lee run the offense. And still Blejica is not a center. Always getting caught out. His offense suffers.C'est incroyable comment Bucks est entrain d'humilier Golden State 😧 #NBA #GoldenStateWarriors #bucksWe are getting fuckin’ COOKED smh and this nigga Steph out there getting cardio! Tighten tf up @warriorsY’all hellah weak @warriors@Felix10111061 @warriors @NBCSAuthentic lmaoooThis is starting to look like one of those “find your pride” and “stop playing like dipshits” game … emphasis on the former.

They are unable to comprehend that when the outside shot isn't going in, you HAVE to gain momentum by going to the rack and getting to the line.

No movement on offense, as well...

#NBA75Of all the @nba franchises, the @warriors and @MiamiHEAT come to my mind as culture franchises. As in the players adjust to the culture established (win or lose)s Perhaps the @Bucks now? Other franchises today the player define the culture including @lakers and @celtics.@colethefan @warriors Why did TNT black game out in Los Angeles?We can’t watch it locally 🤔?Lindell Wigginton (@Lwigginton5) in warmups with the @Bucks earlier tonight, preparing for the regular season @NBA game vs. @warriors. https://t.co/5KERXJhSfr@NBAonTNT @warriors @Bucks Not if you are in the LA area, blacked out here for some reason.@warriors @StephenCurry30 Hope we get the W tonight and all the games@warriors LETS GET IT DONE.@statmuse @warriors @WarriorsPR Those are Dillion brooks numbers 😭😭😭😭Jogão entre Golden State Warriors e Milwaukee Bucks@ceriselukita @warriors @StephenCurry30 Are you crying because I told curry to improve more?

Go Watch Live Here➡️ https://t.co/FTIVp2CVNcIt's nights like tonight the Warriors wish they had Wiseman. Looney just picked up 2 early fouls, and Golden State don't have many big, agile bodies to put on Giannis.No good games on tonight just @warriors/@BucksI expect @Giannis_An34 to live in the paint against the Warriors tonight w/ no Draymond Green and a lesser talent of Kevon Looney at Center. Looney has already picked up his 2nd foul of the game and that’s on the first couple touches Giannis had in the paint #NBA @warriors @Bucks@NBAonTNT why is the @Bucks &amp; @warriors game blacked out in my area? I’m in Los Angeles.@NBAonTNT @warriors @Bucks Anyone know why Los Angeles can't watch the game?This @warriors team is not the same warriors without @Money23Green he needs to get healthy@NBAonTNT @warriors @Bucks Why can't I watch in LA?@ceriselukita @KingsRatio @warriors @StephenCurry30 he’s right thoThe @sixers vs @celtics game tomorrow that was flexed out of @ESPNNBA will still be aired on @TV5manila at 9 am.

- Curry is overrated and can’t defend
- Draymond can’t score
- Wiggins a walking brick
- Klay is old and washed
- Poole/Lee/JTA/GP2 will fall off when Klay returns 
- I only speak facts 🤷‍♀️🤷‍♀️🤷‍♀️

Most overrated team in league 🤣🤣🤣@warriors free jersey would be nice@Warriorsnin3rs @warriors How could that possibly happen? ?Game. On.
