Damian Lillard averaged 34/2/6 to ensure his team went to the Finals.

Their first winning record since 2015-16, when they finished 44-38, same as this year. They will face Philly round 1. Damian Lillard will play.4. PISTONS: Jaden Ivey

Cade Cunningham is a star in the making. As Killian Hayes continues to develop, Detroit should be looking to complete their backcourt of the future. Ivey is the fearless competitor they need! He’s a solid passer, QUICK, athletic, a pace pusher, and clutch. https://t.co/0ff0FheeDnThe Detroit Pistons are underdogs tomorrow. They’ve covered 16 straight.

Wesley is an elite athlete and aggressive shotmaker, making him a dangerous three level scorer. If Wesley continues to polish his offensive game, Detroit could get a steal in the 2nd round. https://t.co/XhelKujseGBanchero on the @DetroitPistons 82-0Banchero will be a Detroit Piston next year. https://t.co/W0d6wJUtyW@money_talks65 @JamaulCannon @DomDolla22 Wayne Ellington shot 42.2% for 3-pointers off 6 attempts last season for the Detroit Pistons, but rookie Austin Reaves gets more playing time.
