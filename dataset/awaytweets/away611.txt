Attached is my write-up for tonight's pick. This is a 1.5 unit play for me at the moment. As always, feel free to voice your opinions and/or DM me. BoL tonight everyone! https://t.co/JDodnkV6oy@FDSportsbook can we get some more player Props for the Miami Heat game@MiamiClutchPE @AllUCanHeat1 @K_Said_Que Miami keeps losing against teams with good "twin towers" centers/power forwards, like Nuggets, Lakers, Bucks. The Heat can counter that by playing Bam at power forward &amp; Yurtzeven/Dedmon at center, Butler at small forward, Strus/Robinson shooting guard, Lowry/Herro at point.NBA:🏀
Indiana Pacers +2.5 -110 3️⃣ Max
Orlando Magic Alta 213 -110 3️⃣ Max
Chicago Bulls -1.5 -115 1️⃣
Houston Rockets Alta  233.5 -110 1️⃣
Miami Heat +3 -110 1️⃣@MiamiHEAT Like if you do heroin@ojmcduffie81 @MiamiHEAT @FlaPanthers OJ! You were one of my favorite players growing up! Used to pretend I was you running routes diving for sideline catches as a kid 😂@MiamiHEAT Big Bam fan but he should not be an all-star this year@MiamiHEAT How does he deserve all star lmao@MiamiHEAT @FTX_Official Is it really a b2b if there’s a day in between the games?@QC00KWRLD @MiamiHEAT how can you be so bad at being a troll@Kenny16Techs The first time my dad took me to a heat game at the original Miami arena, we waited in the usual long line to get out of the parking lot. While stuck there, we saw a woman get completely naked and walk home. I was probably 9 years old. We were not in a rush to leave.@MiamiHEAT Rt if you’re sad #ElClasico 😪@LockedOnHeat Between Omer, Gabe, Max &amp; Caleb, who in your opinion will the @MiamiHEAT find most difficult to retain long term? And who they cannot afford to lose?@DomDelmonte @CatsTerritory The Dolphins ownership sucks, the Marlins are a laughing stock, Inter-Miami underestimated their expectations, what other good SFL team is there to root for and see win besides the Panthers (and Heat), really the only good team we have. So I'm glad people are starting to catch on@MiamiHEAT Heat twitter 🐐Being an NBA fan in the UK means you have no sleep schedule

Gotta love it. #HEATCulture #HeatTwitter@TonyHEAT3xWC @MiamiHEAT He’s really got an issue with dwade@Mrs_Mags1991 @MiamiHEAT @CoupNBA Both wore 14 at NCSU, both transferred, both made the NBA, and they are now teammates. Crazy.@turnupturboo @_Dieth_ @Randomp00711062 @NBAMemes &amp; what would lead you to that conclusion? Against Miami in 2019 he said it was “over” when they went up 6 in the final minute. They gave up 6 unanswered points&amp;went into overtime&amp;the heat had 16 unanswered points.But sure, he wouldn’t give up a big lead.

So they cant $143 million. Heat had acess to the full MLE because they did not renouce their bird rights. When you are an over the cap team tou get the full mle not the mini mle@flasportsbuzz @AdamHBeasley Also, where did this Heat stuff come from? Cmon. This is all wayyyyy too miami 😂Miami Heat play there exact mid point of the season game tonight and are currently 3rd in the conference 3 games off the lead. 
With 41 games left to play after tonight Miami only have 16 away games to play in that.

@CoupNBA goes into how Ömer is enduring, and trucking through, every bump in his rookie season road while turning himself into an impact player when needed ⬇️Meanwhile through injuries and covid protocols Spo has the Heat in 3rd place in the East. This is hall of fame level coaching. Hope the other franchise is taking notes in Miami Gardens. Making someone a HC is an important decision and you gotta choose the right one like Pat did. https://t.co/gy03497Y7BThis is garbage. So we gonna act like Pierce didn't outplay LeBron in Game 7 of thr 2008 East Semis? The Celtics challenged LeBron to the point where he teamed up with DWade in Miami. That was the whole point. An aging Celtics squad still pushed Bron's Heat to 7 games in 2012. https://t.co/4eTUEZZYnT👀

Miami’s top three leading rebounders are Dewayne Dedmon, Omer Yurtseven and P.J. Tucker.

Good luck to the expansion team and I am very appreciative of the league embracing my second and third fav sports of @nascar @IndyCar + @NBA w/ Jimmie and our @MiamiHEAT 's own @DwyaneWade ! 🏀 🏁 ⚽ #MLS@lowell_81 @MiamiHEAT I don't think an accusation like that is necessary lol. Why would he just not want to play ball anymore? The Heat have been beating up contending teams in his absence, so there's no need to rush him. The more rest he gets, the better.Tyler Herro’s 33 points &amp; Duncan Robinson’s 27, both off the bench at PHO, became the 4th pair of HEAT teammates to score at least 25 points off the bench. 

They join Wade/ Dragic (twice) &amp; Beasley/Cook (once) per @MiamiHEAT game notes. 

Brought to you by @WaterCleanupFL@nique_smoov It was definitely Miami Heat Lebron that hurt that boy feelings.The Miami Heat are only .5 of a game away from being the #2 seed in the East. Keep in mind Bam and Jimmy haven’t played a healthy game together for close to 3 months… #BeNervous@Wadesburner @ChefTrillie_ @MiamiHEAT I mean is he even wearing a brace at this point? It's been over a month I feel like enough time has passedWhy did we trade him??? @MiamiHEAT https://t.co/itWItlWlsf@MiamiHEAT look at Edrice, so inspirationalCONFIRMED: 

Victor Oladipo’s rehab has been greatly successful. The Miami Heat are eyeing a return to game action before the All Star Break (Feb 20th). Look for him to be available early February.
