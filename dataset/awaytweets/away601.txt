Then when the Cavs get a big spot like tonight, they don‚Äôt want any of the criticism that possibly comes with being in the spot light.@BallySportsCLE @cavs @SerenaWinters Garland had a horible game tonight, looked out of control, still learning how to play against the great teams, but it will come. If he played a normal hame Cavs had a chance. They never gave up!!! Team play against two scorers3 7 footers btw @cavs https://t.co/erRqbX2G6LI think it‚Äôs safe to say the Lauri Markkanen experiment isn‚Äôt working! Money down the drain!!!üíØ @cavsWarriors fans, Klay Thompson makes his long-anticipated return in Golden State's matchup against the Cleveland Cavaliers.

They might beat the kings by 30 tomorrow.@spookybutthole3 @harry69925610 @WeTalkinSports2 @DwyaneWade @KlayThompson @evanmobley @dariusgarland22 @cavs I guess Rubio didn‚Äôt play. ü§î@GarlandEnjoyer @cavs yes, this was 100% Lauri's fault!!! The only player with major minutes with zero turnovers. Plus-minus -3, for example Garland -22, Love -21, Allen -17. You're a basketball genius!@JoshMonast @cavs Yeah, my main criticism of JB is his lack of Xs/Os. HE seems like a great scheme guy and a great motivator, but he makes bad adjustments sometimes, on top of for some reason stopping hot streaks. Did it last night to Windler and Garland.@okudah_szn @cavs This is the best defensive team in the league.@WaviiXo @Xzelasmr @BakerToLandry @cavs These browns fans jumping to the cavs and jinxing them would be the ultimate shit thing to happen to us.Warriors 96 Cavs 82
(Klay is back lmaoooo)

Rest in piss @cavsHouston Rockets 123 (Christian Wood 23 pts) Minnesota Timberwolves 141 (Karl Anthony Towns 40 pts, Jarred Vanderbilt 21 pts, 19 rebs, D'angelo Russell 22 pts, 10 asists), Golden State Warriors 96 (Stephen Curry 28 pts) Cleveland Cavaliers 82 (Lamar Stevens 17 pts)The trade for Rajon Rondo may be a good trade for the @Cavs to finish the season.

However, Colin Sexton does need to be retained and continue to grow with Garland, Okoro, Allen, Mobley, and crew.@cavs At least Lamar put up some points@GarlandBurner @cavs Yes him aswell I forgot about him lol.@cavs Please tell Lauri to play ball ! It's been a long time he don't ! Dean Wade could better@cavs This was a horrible night for a lot of the guys tonight. We just gotta move on to the next one. Let‚Äôs a get a win tommorow@RagelessGamer @cavs Cringe statement#Warriors #DubNation
Rondo is just a great player. 
Thank you @cavs #Cavs@Xzelasmr @BakerToLandry @cavs He's allowed to have a bad game like everybody else, foh@cavs Solid defense to hold a very good team to under 100 at least we have that@RagelessGamer @cavs garland is trashSteph Curry: 28 pts
Kay Thompson: 17 pts
The Splash Brothers @warriors combine for 45 pts  in a 96-82 win over the @cavs and are now 30-9@cavs Could‚Äôve been a lot worse for a rough offensive night, could‚Äôve been a winnable game otherwise@ChrisFedor I think the @cavs lead the nba in pump fake‚Äôs and then turn the ball over.Vit√≥ria dos Warriors!

Onto the next.@cavs Did DG get hurt@cavs Please get back to the usual winning ways of this season and rebound better@cavs this team will not make the playoffs if they continue playing with this lack of hustle, heart, pride and aggression. 

Theyve played with their tale between their legs since Rubio went down. I think Garland might be scared, to be honest. I thought he was tougher than this.@cavs never fought, idk what you mean "kept fighting"@cavs tough loss, lotta energy in the building for the warriors tnS/O to our guy #KevonLooney with a career high 18 rebounds tonight as the Warriors defeat the @Cavs https://t.co/ULLfvpomu8@cavs Do better.@cavs give garland more minutes next time@cavs On to the next@cavs Well that was badImagine being the Cleveland Cavaliers and trying not to cheer for Klay üíÄ@cavs DG please don't be hurtHow @cavs didnt cover that fucking game is beyond me.

They miss fts because theyre playing hesitantly, there giving up rebounds and theyre hesitating to shootValiant effort by the fellas. Who holds the Warriors... THE WARRIORS.... under 100?
