But that’s what happens to young teams in this situation. #Letemknow@smh24yt_ @PhillieP6 @cavs Thats understandable. Warriors get away with everything in the paint and Mobley is a rookie.

It's been a long time he don't ! Dean Wade could better@cavs This was a horrible night for a lot of the guys tonight. We just gotta move on to the next one. Let’s a get a win tommorow@RagelessGamer @cavs Cringe statement#Warriors #DubNation
Rondo is just a great player. 
Thank you @cavs #Cavs@Xzelasmr @BakerToLandry @cavs He's allowed to have a bad game like everybody else, foh@cavs Solid defense to hold a very good team to under 100 at least we have that@RagelessGamer @cavs garland is trashSteph Curry: 28 pts
Kay Thompson: 17 pts
The Splash Brothers @warriors combine for 45 pts  in a 96-82 win over the @cavs and are now 30-9@cavs Could’ve been a lot worse for a rough offensive night, could’ve been a winnable game otherwise@ChrisFedor I think the @cavs lead the nba in pump fake’s and then turn the ball over.Vitória dos Warriors!

Gotta get that one back tomorrow night in SAC@RagelessGamer @cavs You’re weird@cavs stop turning the ball over and get rebounds next time@cavs Trade for cam reddish and dont do that again@PhillieP6 @cavs he’s allowed to have a bad game, he’s been amazing all seasonThe @warriors (30-9) welcome back @KlayThompson 17pts on 3-8 from beyond the arc in 19 minutes with a 96-82 win over the @cavs. Curry led all scorers with 28pts, going 4-11 from deep. #DubNation https://t.co/2LDFif0Ikz@PhillieP6 @cavs it was almost like JB was telling him not to shoot anymore or sum@PhillieP6 @cavs just a bad game that’s all@cavs Dint take care of the ball well enough@cavs Next game we need to rebound, cut down on 2nd chance points and we will be fine. It was a bad game overall. Nobody played well except stevens😕@Evan_ROY_Mobley @cavs These games happen. Regroup &amp; win in SAC &amp; SA then all is good@cavs If rondo and stevens the only ones showing up we might as well tank again 82 points is a joke@BakerToLandry @cavs he was off tonight@cavs @dariusgarland22 GARBAGE@cavs y’all ain’t fight fa nun tonight.@cavs Just an uncharacteristic, abysmal game of basketball from us.

Onto the next.@cavs Did DG get hurt@cavs Please get back to the usual winning ways of this season and rebound better@cavs this team will not make the playoffs if they continue playing with this lack of hustle, heart, pride and aggression. 

Theyve played with their tale between their legs since Rubio went down. I think Garland might be scared, to be honest. I thought he was tougher than this.@cavs never fought, idk what you mean "kept fighting"@cavs tough loss, lotta energy in the building for the warriors tnS/O to our guy #KevonLooney with a career high 18 rebounds tonight as the Warriors defeat the @Cavs https://t.co/ULLfvpomu8@cavs Do better.@cavs give garland more minutes next time@cavs On to the next@cavs Well that was badImagine being the Cleveland Cavaliers and trying not to cheer for Klay 💀@cavs DG please don't be hurtHow @cavs didnt cover that fucking game is beyond me. Fucking chumpsFellas kept fighting.

[FD(27.3) DK(26.5)]#Golden State Warriors - Cleveland Cavaliers ★ #Partido finalizado: 96 - 82 ★ by: #SofaScore@cavs u have ur bigs in with markkannan and love etc, make a comeback, then decide “hey we might win this thing, lets put in garland, rondo, and everyone who cant score and turns the ball over”. make it make sense.@cavs Never thought id see this team not hustle...looking like garbage since rubio went down...

They miss fts because theyre playing hesitantly, there giving up rebounds and theyre hesitating to shootValiant effort by the fellas. Who holds the Warriors... THE WARRIORS.... under 100? 

The answer is... your CLEVELAND CAVALIERS.👏🏽 for Kevin Looney. Career high 18 rebounds against @cavs jumbo lineup.@cavs Trade for cam reddishWake up call for the @cavs@cavs Garland looking like a coward tonight. He isnt ready@wasted_voter @cavs Thought I was the only one who noticed this lol getting shades of last years CavsThis @cavs team doesn’t know the meaning of the word quit.The Cleveland Cavaliers are a better team with Collin Sexton@cavs Why is Allen suddenly soft AF now?Hold onto the ball. Finish strong. Get your defensive reboundJust watching the @warriors Vs @cavs game and then I hear the instrumental to my guys @SquareOff @VADO_MH &amp; Wingy - “I’m Lit.” It’s funny because everyone is constantly screaming  the term “Lit” &amp; don’t know that this very song is where it came from. link https://t.co/VJk9ErBDQr@bucketsdnt @cavs Nah this happens everytime they play a full roster.The Cleveland Cavaliers are one good/great wing away from running the league.Warriors fans, Klay Thompson makes his long-anticipated return in Golden State's matchup against the Cleveland Cavaliers.

Anyway, check out this 5 of 4 People Struggle with Math - Premium T-shirt for Men (Redbubble). https://t.co/mBiek5QLWs.And the @cavs just never quit. Gotta love this squad. I’m fully expecting a 10-0 run from the Warriors right now@FaceofTheVoid1 @cavs Right when I post dat he decides to basically get up back in the game😂I just remembered that Rondo is now on the @cavs@cavs shit team a pussy, why garland ??@mukaihd @cavs Right when we have this convo he decides to start hoopin😂I double down on this take tonight watching @cavs vs @warriors!   So much standing around and watching others shoot the long ball they mostly miss unless your Curry.  Most players jog 3/4 court with a few hustle exceptions.  Pretty ugly to watch. Miss the old @NBA skills. https://t.co/DFXT2wdIu2@cavs at this point, i kinda hate lauriIts a shame what that Lebron James did to that Cleveland Cavaliers organization. They should have drafted Dwyane Wade. Kevin love! Just retire.WATCH: Klay Thompson puts Cleveland Cavaliers on poster in return to action https://t.co/plQBiLun6gWATCH: Klay Thompson puts Cleveland Cavaliers on poster in return to action https://t.co/y2ZQs8ovbY@cavs y’all trash man 😂🤦🏽‍♂️@cavs At this point, I would bench ANYONE who gives up an offensive rebound@cavs The smoothness of the new Cavs got disrupted tonight - not by the Warriors but maybe by themselves. Ask JB or Austin Carr or Campy Russell what happened. Just my random thoughts.@Charmader6 @cavs This game is over@cavs It’s overLooking like @Cavs will be 0-3 when I watch the entire game...@cavs Cavs look good with Windler on the court.@TDNike @realStanVG @warriors @cavs Hell yeah! That's my hometown! 925 all dayBitch @cavs@cavs yeah that might do itThe highest scoring player on the @cavs is 13 pts @KlayThompson only played 13 minutes and got more den that lol #KlayDay@cavs lmao 14 points…..back to the old shit cavs@cavs it happens to the best of us gang we ah see them laterLet's go @cavs #letemknowGood shout out to the city of Martinez by @realStanVG just now in the @warriors @cavs telecast. #bayareanative@cavs Hey we aren’t getting super blown out and that means there’s progress. Keep pushing to the end.@NBAStatNerd @SoloLocks @cavs Lauri could be 6’4 and he’d be the exact same player 😭@cavs unlucky to play the warriors the same day Klay came back@cavs This type of game shows that Cavs aren’t truly ready for prime time. Still better than expected, but a few years away@NBAStatNerd @cavs That 3rd quarter was the worst I’ve ever seen in the nba@mukaihd @cavs Fr his passing been so off@kadenthompkins @cavs He doesnt have a rhythm yet. Cavs have also played with no heart since Rubio went down@cavs back to the lottery and @dariusgarland22 sucks@cavs Worst quarter we’ve played since the 4th quarter of game 2 against Charlotte@cavs #Cavs youth showing. Chalk this up to a learning experience.@kadenthompkins @cavs he might be truly washed this time@Kiko__6 @cavs Miles clear of barnes@cavs We lost our balls, heart and soul when Rubio was injured. Allen and Rubio have given up TONS of offensive boards. The others too. Nobody is keeping a body on their man. They arent hustling as much, theyre not as aggressive. Someone needs to step up and get them in line@Charmader6 @cavs What?@SoloLocks @cavs Kevin Looney is out rebounding three seven footers by himself. But that’s also counting Lauri being 7ft and that seems impossible sometimes@cavs @cavs is the last one a white flag because you're giving up?@cavs Stop turning the damn ball over and stop letting them get offensive rebounds god damn man this is the worst we’ve played all season cmon play some defense and hit some shots thank you@cavs damn we forgot how to play basketball@cavs wake up please, stop fumbling the ball so much@cavs Wtf are WE doing? WE have tou rebound the ball. My god@cavs Gross@cavs Leave Lauri here@cavs Don't care@cavs Rondo been bad bruh@cavs The Warriors have attempted 19 more shots than you, stop turning the ball over and grab defensive rebounds.Make it respectable. @cavs@cavs Ouch@cavs Y’all need to stop the turnovers gahdamn@cavs Cmon let’s push this out and comeback@cavs Would need an incredible 4th Quarter to pull this one off@cavs I hate you@cavs Well…@cavs try making shots and NOT turning the ball over, it may help a bit@cavs Among the most miserable quarters of basketball I’ve ever watched@cavs This is embarrassingThrough 3 quarters

Cleveland Cavaliers: 60 points

This team is playing scare and not playing to their strengths.
I'm turning this off... pitiful!WHAT THE FUCK ARE YALL DOING @cavs https://t.co/5hW3lJpKA2This is a really good learning experience for a really young @cavs team. With Colin Sexton‘s offense I think this is a closer game. But we’re young we’ll get there #LetEmKnowThe @cavs  are getting sped up, playing too fast, slow down. #CLEvsGSW@Scubaxxxx @ChandlerEnfing1 @cavs @LamarStevens11 @socios Markannen is a shooter who is shooting 30% from three and is playing SF while being a terrible premier defender and he’s also a terrible interior defenderWhy can’t the @cavs make free throws lately?!??  And when you have 3 7-footers on the floor you’d figure they’d get a rebound now and again. GeezWe are gonna shoot ourselves out the game gunning 3’s. We are down, stick to the course and do what works @cavs!! Settle down, get stops, and move the ball 🏀! #letemknow@karthikspb @cavs yeah a young team against a contender@cavs seem like they don’t have their legs tonight. This can get ugly. #LetEmKnow@mariuscojocaruu @cavs So much for ruining it nigga 😂.. L it is for your bitch ass team 😅😂"You gotta put the ball on the floor before you move."

We deserve better from the @cavs and @BallySportsCLECome on @cavs let get it together ain’t to far behind. @Cavs_ManiaMy young @cavs are so shook right now.@cavs we fucking blow@cavs Stop tweetingYOURE SUPPOSED TO TRY @CAVS@cavs Stop turning the ball over@cavs Na wtf is we doing@cavs Can we play some defense??@FilmWog @MrCavalier34 @cavs "Right down euclid"
