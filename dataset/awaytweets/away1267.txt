Ben Simmons was the last straw. Brooklyn is broken. Boston wants it more in every way. THEY WANT THE SWEEP. I look for the Nets go down by 10 or so and then check out. Give me the defense that’s giving KD fits.

Usually when the challenge is live, it will filter the moments you don't have so you can shop in the marketplace for them.

Running my own filter for Boston Celtics + Rare brings no All-Star moments, so I'm going to have to lean on the answer no for this one. 🫤@celtics They're about to sweep the New Jersey pets.Are The Celtics (+190) Worthy Of Being The Eastern Conf Favs? 💯

You know whats good for ratings? Un-Rigged games so that fans actually want to watch the NBA. If you look at last 2 minute report data Scott Foster is 99% more likely to make an incorrect call than other officialsSource says @Lakers are the "starting point" if Carmelo Anthony plays next year.

- Exec: "mutual interest" if he wants to join the @BrooklynNets (finally).

- @nyknicks? "It's crowded"

- And beware darkhorses like @MiamiHEAT &amp; @celtics

Boston Celtics - Paul Pierce/KG trade
Kyrie Irving - Plays half games, gets full salary.
Kevin Durant - From Slim Reaper to Grim Sleeper

Ben Simmons -  paid full salary to practiceThe Boston Celtics are forcing me to change my pick again.The Boston Celtics are special.@celtics Sweep the Nets@@SteveNash @KDTrey5 @joetsai1999 Teach that rookie coach and management, they are as tender as toilet paper!@tfougere13 @celtics 1 or 2 dodgy flul calls.can have a big impact on a game.
