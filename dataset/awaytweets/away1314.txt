1) Limit turnovers
2) Limit their offensive boards
3) Hit your 3s
4) Get the Warriors into foul trouble early
5) Stick with the off ball cutter on defense. Have to be very active defensively.

#GamblingTwitter #nbapicks@stevensif21 @unczeched @OfficialNBARefs @dallasmavs @warriors @NBAonTNT I don't watch Luka enough, but I can assure you that Steph gets fouled on at least half of his threes. Defenders don't give him proper landing space and refs rarely ever call those fouls on him. And don't get me started on his driving, because he gets mauled inside the paint.@investvoyager @dallasmavs Im rooting for Luna 2.0 airdrop. #LUNA #Airdrop @investvoyagerRight Before the game 12 years ago we were eating at the restaurant below Jack Daniel’s Club and Dirk was the only person there in the practice court shooting free-throws.   we won that game 121-112. #mavs #mffl @dallasmavs https://t.co/vhsfORzPgYTonight at 5:30 #NBAConferenceFinals

The Mavericks are in a great business city like Dallas.

This is where the marketability of the team helps their team’s cap space.

Dude coaches a basketball team. It isn't even the f'ng Globetrotters. 

You inevitably feel bad about this pointless tweet, or you're a dick... Or I guess maybe a "the Dallas Mavericks are my life" sports fan?@jj_redick @_thejsd You said Steph can’t get his own shot. You said because he needs all the movement that the warriors do to get a shot off. You didn’t say those words?

Nearly half of ALL Stephen Curry game-winners have come against the Dallas Mavericks.

￼@blueshockeygrl @mamamoose18 This is awesome😍Thank you. I'm certainly following you now.SWEET!!

Dallas Cowboys- #4 Dak Prescott/#12 Roger Staubach (may be impossible,hoping it's not) 
Dallas Mavericks- #41 Dirk Nowitzki (may be hard to get)

That was not a layup, that was a tip back shot against the backboard. That is not the method of a layup one is taught when learning bball!@luka7doncic @dallasmavs better don't let this shit happen, man!

Dallas was able to avoid the sweep last night but they head back to San Francisco in a game that will be much harder to win!

there's a chance @Warriors can clinch WCF tomorrow &amp; @celtics can clinch ECF Fri 5/27 which means #NBA fans would go 5 LONG days w/out #NBAPlayoffs basketball😢

Here's to hoping @dallasmavs &amp; @MiamiHEAT push their series to 7 games🤞🤞can you find it in your heart to not lose game 5 tomorrow @dallasmavs https://t.co/7MdZG4vxmK@Mavs_FFL #MFFL   warriors are the only @nba team to lose a series when up 3-1.  @dallasmavs let’s give them some more history by being only them to lose a series being up 3-0 #dALLasINSteve Kerr: “There’s 50 senators, right now, who refuse to vote on H.R. 8, which is a background check rule that the House passed,” Kerr said ahead of his team’s game versus the Dallas Mavericks in remarks that went viral. https://t.co/Nm8qdBLOYm@boltlol2 @MiamiHeatFinest @KingM0310 @NBA @Bucks @Suns @dallasmavs @nuggets @celtics Curry d isn't his strongest suit, Luka would cook him. So demar and ja stopping booker n Tatum...joel will get his but joker mvp good lol. And it's giannis.....@ShannonSharpe I have the @celtics winning everything... IF the @dallasmavs don't come come back to win the west!!!
🙂🙂🙂...😉I will say this, IF @dallasmavs win ALL the remaining games in #WCF and eliminate the @warriors, I WILL OFFICIALLY boycott the @NBA and calling foul on the NBA for DESTROYING the lovely game of basketball by RIGGING IT! #Rigged@Bartlett_DJ @NBA @NBL @dallasmavs @ChrisAnstey13 Had to scroll down to see what @Bartlett_DJ  was standing on because once I saw it was @ChrisAnstey13 I knew it had to be a big box or similar.#nobodyaskedmebut I have my suspicions that @NBA is rigged;

1. #DillonBrooks suspension 
2. @Suns game 7 sudden "meltdown" vs @dallasmavs 
3. @MiamiHEAT game 5 "meltdown" vs @celtics 

For all you know, NBA "planned" for #ECF &amp; #WCF. But, as of know, it's just suspicion.@RealSkipBayless But... but... what about that "fire" and "desire" that came with the "wining culture" that #PatRiley brought to the @MiamiHEAT ?!

🤣🤣🤣

I'm telling you! IF @dallasmavs doesn't come back, the @celtics are going to win the @NBA finals.
🙂🙂🙂Dallas Mavericks are 7 wins away from winning nba championshipHey @dallasmavs, if you wanted to extend your series over there, I’d appreciate it very greatly.

Best regards,
A Celtics fanNow I need the Dallas Mavericks to win more games for the Celtics sake! https://t.co/0UuM6UGF68@dallasmavs @mcuban let’s bring this man back as an Assistant HC or advisor with @swish41 to take on the future in Dallas!

It’s a predictable game of terrible shooters who are not efficient on offense and lack luster on defense. We need size and power back in the nba. The NCAA still play the game the right way. Every team runs the same offense and no defense. SUCKS!!!!!!Anyway what time the Dallas Mavericks play tmrw I’m trying to see my husband… https://t.co/zeQFTuiU8ZLuka Doncic, Dallas Mavericks Extend Series vs. Warriors, All-NBA Teams, Celtics Heat Game 5 Preview https://t.co/pGQbynAUnJLet’s go @dallasmavs!@DAonCBS I think y’all are making a huge mistake by thinking the Dallas mavericks are completely done. We saw what they did to the number 1 seed of the @Suns  so just slow down with the automatic @warriors  @BostonCeltics  for now at least. I have to give the @dallasmavs the respect theyMy little sister, who will be part of the program, screamed at me, “THE MAVS ARE SPONSORING, WHY ARE YOU LYING.” 🤣

Grateful with @dallasmavs / @MavsOffCourt for the opportunity. https://t.co/A9eaAwLpByFS1's Skip Bayless believes that Jimmy Butler (Miami Heat) is the best player left in the NBA Playoffs including Luka Doncic (Dallas Mavericks) and Steph Curry (Golden State Warriors). Lol 😂 https://t.co/KiNFIoalktSo what I’m seeing is @dallasmavs and @MiamiHEAT need another star. Should I be preparing for 2011 Finals rematch next year if they each get one?@IndyMaverick13 @dallasmavs @hotelsdotcom I heard they’re all for him@GiggityGN @dallasmavs they have to start making their 3s with consistency and not letting off the gas if they want any chance to take this seriesAll I saw at @GovAbbott's press conference was a bunch of old white racist do nothing men pretending to be cowboys.

With just one ring he’ll still be talked about as being one of the best like Aaron Rodgers..@Money23Green showcases his basketball IQ, not just on offense, but also in ensuring an airtight defense! 💯
