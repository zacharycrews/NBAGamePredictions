5) Stick with the off ball cutter on defense. Have to be very active defensively.

#GamblingTwitter #nbapicks@stevensif21 @unczeched @OfficialNBARefs @dallasmavs @warriors @NBAonTNT I don't watch Luka enough, but I can assure you that Steph gets fouled on at least half of his threes. Defenders don't give him proper landing space and refs rarely ever call those fouls on him. And don't get me started on his driving, because he gets mauled inside the paint.@investvoyager @dallasmavs Im rooting for Luna 2.0 airdrop. #LUNA #Airdrop @investvoyagerRight Before the game 12 years ago we were eating at the restaurant below Jack Daniel‚Äôs Club and Dirk was the only person there in the practice court shooting free-throws.   we won that game 121-112. #mavs #mffl @dallasmavs https://t.co/vhsfORzPgYTonight at 5:30 #NBAConferenceFinals

Moments of silence don‚Äôt work in times of anguish. We need a Chorus of Change. Instead of silence, raise your anguish and release it in a yell that will move the masses and the minority. #Uvalde @warriors @celtics @dallasmavs @MiamiHEAT @NBAA streak nobody is talking about:

75 straight years where a former Knick has been in the NBA finals. 

Not looking good for year 76 though (Frank Ntilikina - @dallasmavs)@JimmyRZM @dallasmavs @jorgehenav No mi Jimmy.@StatMamba @MavsMuse @LukaMuse77 @luka7doncic @dallasmavs @MavsPR @swish41 For Luka‚Äôs sake hopefully he gets at least one ring or he‚Äôll go down as a bust with all the hype around him. With just one ring he‚Äôll still be talked about as being one of the best like Aaron Rodgers..@Money23Green showcases his basketball IQ, not just on offense, but also in ensuring an airtight defense! üíØ

Watch the All-Defensive Team member and his @warriors take on the @dallasmavs in Game 5 tomorrow!
