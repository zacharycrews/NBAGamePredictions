Boston strong no matter what.It really boils down to how the @celtics plan to guard Jimmy. If they insist on using Marcus Smart, Jimmy will shred the Celtics. They need to box and one him, but Jimmy moves w/o the ball very well and I doubt the Cs have anyone who can keep up w/him for the full game.@starpratinum45 @celtics Agree@celtics Championship caliber teams close it out in 6 at home up 3-2. They don't come out playing like absolute trash and let the Heat force a game 7 in Miami where they have been hot all season. Heat take the momentum of game 6 win to Miami and win game 7 by double digits.The Boston Celtics should win this game but it’s tough to trust them@coochiesIayer_ @doc_brownie @BrownToWilliams @celtics But you right lol, this reverse layup on Rob … wasn’t on Rob 😂😉 https://t.co/n9kLoEc78F🔴𝐖𝐀𝐓𝐂𝐇 𝐋𝐢𝐯𝐞 𝐕𝐈𝐀📺 @FreeNBAStreamsz

-Limit Jimmy Buckets to 32 Points
-Limit Turnovers to 16
-Limit Miami to 16 FTA

If they do 2/3 of these things, they'll easily win.@celtics Good... season on the lineIf the @celtics lose tonight I blame smart for changing his hair@JTTheBrick @celtics @MiamiHEAT Can’t wait for your 26th anniversary of being on Twitter spaces!@PolaBore  Thank you for following us!

It’s time for both Tatum and Brown to take over this game from the opening tip, get over the hump, lead the Boston Celtics to their 22nd trip to the NBA Finals. 

☘️ x 18 https://t.co/rmYD7rJh1Rwin or lose, I’m a Boston Celtics Fan for LIFE☘️@celtics AVAILABLE to play and ABLE to play at 100% are 2 different things.  I know Derrick will come out playing at 110%.The @celtics moved on from The  @MiamiHEAT before game 6. IMO they won’t be able to move on from it. Tatum/Brown are still young. They looked overwhelmed. Wouldn’t be surprised if the Heat won by 15 tonight. #NBAPlayoffs #Celtics #HEATCultureIn order for the #MiamiHeat to win #Game7, they'll have to (at least) shoot &gt; 51 eFG% (unlikely), attempt 18 FT's (fairly unlikely), and force at least 17 turnovers against the #BostonCeltics. It is pretty unlikely that they'll be able to do all 3 of those things against Boston.Please win today @celtics 🙏🏼@scottzolak @celtics Sitting at the pond kyacking kind of day!😎❤️@m_holdbrook @celtics Tough game@natalienicol_ It’s hot sunny Sunday ☀️ waiting on Game 7 of Eastern Conference Finals Boston Celtics vs Miami Heat 🏀@adanseyy @celtics you’re not part of us masa🤣@WCVB let’s go @celtics #BleedGreenI'm tired of the C's coming up short in the ECF.

83.3% 

For those on the fence with this game… that’s a pretty nice stat. 

I think we see a low scoring defensive battle till the end.Marcus smart will lose this game tonight @celticsI found the "Paul Pierce Dental Surgery" game.

It is an obscure but underrated game in NBA History.

It was November 11, 2004 

Boston Celtics vs. Portland Trailblazers

I want to see that whole game again somehow.

It’s not the defense. It’s a lack of understanding of how to win in all phases. Too much individual heroism. Too much complaining. Too much pressure.@celtics @MiamiHEAT @espn @985TheSportsHub Your keys to winning:

1. Brown having ball security when dribbling.
2. Offense boards
3. Move the basketball don't iso.
4.

I still got Miami Heat winning the NBA Finals. If they beat Celtics, than we could see Miami Heat facing Warriors. This game will be intense for the Heat.

#BleedGreen @celtics https://t.co/9OnH4hYyWU@Jumpshot8 @SDinwiddie_25 @MiamiHEAT @celtics I will be rooting for @celtics The encroaching on the court that Lowry did is unacceptable. Technicals have been given for bench decorum before. Should have been a technical and possible suspension. They would not allow a fan to do what he did. My opinion.@Wayniardo @SDinwiddie_25 @MiamiHEAT @celtics To bad only 11 people can hear u.  Keep talking and I might realize I was wrong to allow u to follow me.

Perhaps that could inspire hope for their chances in Game 7.

In 2009, before the following NBA playoffs, high-schooler Khris Middleton had received his 1st national ranking as a prospect (64th) &amp; noted by scouts as “the best shooter at his position.”

Celtics titles since then: 0.

But I don't like winning outside the house.@celtics Im glad they did this like damn https://t.co/YYAh7vTTTp@FastEddie577 @H2_Waste @JaidenSmitty @celtics White and PP have been better vs Miami.  If Smart sat last night, Celts win.  His decision making and inability to make shots were killers. Reminded me of game 5 vs Bucks.@phishhead35 @stoolpresidente Agreed. NBA wanted Game 7 and did what they had to in order to assure it happened. Butler played his ass off and the Heat won that game, but the many 4Q clear-as-day blown calls certainly helped. Now it’s clear as day…@celtics by a billion tomorrow.@celtics Are these guys playing a game 7 or rolling out of bed?@celtics They need to play.  Sudden death@UnclePreme @celtics Def downThank you nba! @MiamiHEAT Shouldn’t be allowed to stand and scream in @celtics ear like wtf
 #SCREAMING #heat #celtics #game7 https://t.co/vjK5S1fulD@warriors have the benefit of some time off and recovery. Whoever wins between @celtics and @MiamiHEAT will have to battle a well-rested team

#nba #NBAFinals #NBAPlayoffs2022@celtics If Smart did not play Friday night Celts would have won in 6.@JayXp92 @celtics He makes the dumbest fouls and turnovers. Also is too emotional. He needs to control his temper. He got into it with the Coach a while back. I'd trade his arse after the season.Boston Celtics’ Jason Tatum drops 46 points in ‘signature game’ to force Game 7 into the NBA semifinals https://t.co/1LfKNdADBB@RobTilton2 @celtics Talk is cheap.

NBA's partnership with sports betting.@celtics Everybody all in. Let’s get it ☘️@H2_Waste @JaidenSmitty @celtics True. I think with Smart; he tries too hard which causes him to make mistakes. Also, the DPOY couldn't stop Jimmy Buckets from scoring. White may not be as athletic, but his basketball IQ is tremendous. Derrick outplayed Smart last game. More points, assists, steals, 0 turnovers.@DickieV @NYRangers @Canes @MiamiHEAT @celtics @TBLightning Let’s go @Canes !!@DickieV @NYRangers @Canes @MiamiHEAT @celtics @TBLightning Uh it’s at MSG.

👉 Created by Elephant https://t.co/6skOInrsQn@celtics wish Ime Udoka had some balls, and would switch the starting lineup to; Smart, White, Brown, Tatum, Horford, or Smart, Brown, Tatum, G.Will, Horford. The Time Lord clearly isn't 100% yet, and Theis is a better defender/ rebounder than Grant and should be playing(look it up).Gd Bless the @celtics https://t.co/k8mEbAr68z@steve0430 @IRpepito @celtics They DEFINITELY NEED CLOSE UP DEFENSE! Game 6 THEY HAVE HEAT TOO MUCH ROOM/COMFORT TO SHOOT BALL! NEED “UP CLOSE”IN UR FACE DEFENSE AS SOON AS HEAT GET BALL!! UP CLOSE-DEFENSE BOSTON CELTICS! IN UR FACE DEFENSE!!!@jwaves2022 @TherealHassanO @celtics That was draymond not the Celtics@McSports14 @BDCCeltics @celtics It’s been your way almost the whole series LMFAOOOO@celtics If Jayson Tatum doesn't turn the ball over 5+ times and we get more than three 3pters from Brown, Horford, and Smart than I think the celtics cruise to a 102-91 victory. I think Pritchard and Theis should get more minutes in G7, they bring that energy every night that we need. IRelax @MiamiHEAT  , @Money23Green chose @celtics because he wants to face the inferior team!!! Lmao.Y’all better show up pissed off @celticsill pick boston celtics@celtics Ye, you have to contain Jimmy Butler, Bam, Herro, and the other players to beat Miami. GO CELTICS!Miami Heat And Boston Celtics Pay Tribute To Victims In Texas Shooting – CBS Tampa https://t.co/p0mxn4pEQ7I honestly cant say im disappointed in the @Celtics. Even if tomorrow is the last game, I didnt think theyd be 5 wins away from an NBA championship. If they lose, they'll go into the off season looking to add a little more to this core, which Brad Stevens can do.@JosephARoss1 @UnclePreme @celtics Ime Udoka should have doubled Jimmy Butler and said let someone else beat us tonight, and if they do then tip your cap to them. To let Jimmy Buckets to go off for 47 @tdgarden is inexcusable, Udoka didn't make any adjustments, and Tatum should never take the ball up the court.@Sisolym @celtics ratioMe and 3️⃣ my friends discussing how much fun we are going to have on this #MemorialDayWeekend watching the @celtics and @jaytatum0 get 🪣s for game 7️⃣ tomorrow night #DogsofTwittter https://t.co/JU2lizrMi6@celtics Game 7 they better be playing@celtics PLEASE GET THE LEGS I and baskets GOING right from the start of the game.
