I won't second-guess the decision by team executives to let him go, because what's done is done. However, I also think it's fair to suggest that the fault was primarily theirs, rather than his.The Kings' letting go of that man will go down as one of the worst FO/Ownership decisions in recent #NBA History.

you already have a stud who can play make . he'll fit great next 2 cade who already has 5.4 ast  p game . the pistons need someone who can put the ball in the hole . 
he makes you better ( a lot ) trust me . but that's my take@drew77982753 @Lakers @DetroitPistons @SacramentoKings @NBA Having flexibility to me isn‚Äôt just to get top talent. It‚Äôs to get role players and make sure that we don‚Äôt commit before knowing what we really have with the youth.

He‚Äôs good, but he‚Äôs not making us that much better. He‚Äôs not that great of a playmaker or a threat on his outside shooting.

i think if bagley performs well he's gone . bey isn't better than fox 
fox is a top talent that will fit amazing with the young core  and you have him tied down@nuggets Thanks @SacramentoKings@AshtonDaTrainer F**k the pistons lol Clippers organization way better than y‚Äôall.
