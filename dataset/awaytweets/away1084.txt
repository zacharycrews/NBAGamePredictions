I won't second-guess the decision by team executives to let him go, because what's done is done. However, I also think it's fair to suggest that the fault was primarily theirs, rather than his.The Kings' letting go of that man will go down as one of the worst FO/Ownership decisions in recent #NBA History.

you already have a stud who can play make . he'll fit great next 2 cade who already has 5.4 ast  p game . the pistons need someone who can put the ball in the hole . 
he makes you better ( a lot ) trust me . but that's my take@drew77982753 @Lakers @DetroitPistons @SacramentoKings @NBA Having flexibility to me isn’t just to get top talent. It’s to get role players and make sure that we don’t commit before knowing what we really have with the youth. Fox isn’t really a good off ball player, so he doesn’t complement Cade that well. It’s too early for us to commitLast week, Cintron was proud to be a part of the @SacramentoKings Women's Empowerment Night!

He’s good, but he’s not making us that much better. He’s not that great of a playmaker or a threat on his outside shooting.

https://t.co/TciBEjicWv@JamesDeku_ @Lakers @DetroitPistons @SacramentoKings @NBA my opinion : i don't think the pistons can attract top notch free agents . so you'll have flexibility but 4 what 
i think if bagley performs well he's gone . bey isn't better than fox 
fox is a top talent that will fit amazing with the young core  and you have him tied down@nuggets Thanks @SacramentoKings@AshtonDaTrainer F**k the pistons lol Clippers organization way better than y’all.

(Is defense optional now?)@drew77982753 @Lakers @DetroitPistons @SacramentoKings @NBA Why Detroit would trade Bagley and Bey for Fox who is on a max?

If it was for NYC and the fan base, this franchise would be the Sacramento Kings@SacramentoKings fmr STH holders at Arco/G1C before moving to Indy in 2020. We couldn't sit close when in town last yr w/COVID &amp; this yr we used our "STH" money for tix to sit in section 7 close to the bench. Any chance my boys could get a pix with some players afterwards?@BrendanBald @LazyLionsNFT @SacramentoKings Gotta get you in the band king! 😂👑 such a solid videoYo @andre tell that to the @SacramentoKings . I’m trying to go that kings vs warriors game 👀 https://t.co/qTHsww2hN8@LakeBottomH2O @Athletics @SacramentoKings I’d catch a game casually if I am out in Vegas.

Keep every team under 100 points.@gjandrews @Athletics @SacramentoKings If the A’s go to Vegas that’s more trips to Lawry’s@LakeBottomH2O I don't know what to feel anymore. I have stopped spending on anything @Athletics and switched over to @SacramentoKings. Sure, they are horrible but they found a way to stay in norcal.@rbritoreis @nemi1599 @StocktonKings @nbagleague @SacramentoKings @BDASportsINTL @USUBasketball Way to GoThe Wiggins haters can go be @SacramentoKings fans. How soon fake "fans" forget his season because he has struggled a bit recently.
If we cut every player that went through a drought, Curry &amp; Klay would be playing elsewhere
