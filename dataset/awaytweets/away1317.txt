https://t.co/t7LX4ftuJM #abc7now #BayArea #DubNation #GoldBloodedThis is a tough series to pick a winner @celtics is really good but so is the @warriors. I’ve always said the @warriors will give you two games from turnovers and bad shooting but @celtics can go ice cold and can’t close sometimes. I’m just a fan of the game the series.Here we go! Celtics in the finals! Been waiting for this since I was a kid! (Cause I don’t really remember the 2008 finals even though I was 11).

I really couldn’t be prouder about such insane logic. #NBAFinals2022@lexstar20 @celtics @StephenCurry30 @warriors U buggin. This will be the greatest defensive performance in finals history that's about to go down.  And Derrick white will be that dudeIn tonight’s first game of the NBA finals, I think the Warriors -4 are the bet vs the Boston Celtics. I just don’t see the Celtics hanging in for four quarters. I see an 8-15 point win for Golden State by the end of the game! As allways Good luck!!Live stream

Boston #Celtics have played uber physical series thus far where LOTS was allowed. They NEED that type of play to win series. If refs protect #Warriors, it’s ovah!My feeling, that I don’t feel good about, pick tonight:

Boston Celtics: 104
Golden State Warriors: 100@jaytatum0 Gotta get my @jaytatum0 jersey asap, not a fan of basketball but a fan of yours go @celticsWarriors’ Gary Payton II, Otto Porter Jr. and Andre Iguodala are available for Game 1 of the NBA Finals against the Boston Celtics.

Boston Celtics defense, blah blah blah. Yes they have a great defense but they have not faced any team with as potent an offense as Golden State has. And the Warriors are underrated defensively. Curry finally gets the Finals MVPTHE NBA FINALS ARE HERE.

Latest #NBAPlayoffs markets below 👇@gnanodayam @celtics Past experience is huge plus for warriors, if Celtics can hang on till 3 quarters, they can turnaround in 4th..I picked Celtics in 6 over Milwaukee. 

They won in 7. 

I picked Celtics in 6 over Miami. 

They won in 7. 

I’m picking Celtics in 6 over GS. 

So they’ll clearly win in 7.

Game 1:
Ok Warriors 👀
#5 Is The Only Reason I'm Picking You To Win This Series. You All Will Go As He Goes. The Less He Plays 👀 The Less Likely You'll Beat Boston. I'd Like #5 To Get 10 + Points And 10 + Rebounds. I Wanna See Him Shoot The 🏀@RedSox @celtics Certainly hoping the Celtics will play with five and not four in the game. Decisive disadvantage. 😜🏀 @SkeeProfit gives historical analysis surrounding the Golden State Warriors heading into Game 1 of the #NBAFinals as they face off against the Boston Celtics. The Warriors are the much more experienced finals team with tip off coming at 9 PM ET.

Also have to bare in mind that Boston didn't lock in on defense until late January. Since then they had historic defensive numbers. So that defensive rating doesn't show the whole picture for them either.@Amari0932 @OopToRob @celtics scam@rayfordyoung @celtics I said the same shit@kucoincom Boston Celtics !!!!The NBA Finals are starting today.

#NBAFinals
#NBAPlayoffs#GoldenStateWarriors are a better 3point Shooting Team than Boston. I think Boston needs to make 15-18 3’s a game to stay close. They only managed to make more than 15 3’s once against the Heat (Game2: 20. Won 127-102). That being said I don’t think #BostonCeltics will out 3@PortlandSeaDogs @smart_MS3 @celtics We love you guy's Marcus and our

It’s gonna be a good series - Tatum and Wiggins play diff roles. Tatum also has to operate with Wiggins all in his shit. And Wiggins is an ELITE defender with crazy athletic ability, length and quickness at 6’8. And Wiggins doesn’t even need to trip off scoring@thehooperverse @warriors @celtics @SHAQ @TheJetOnTNT @DinosChibi Celtics - 103

@celtics @warriorsBoston Celtics starting #NBAFinals2022 today 😁#AllAbout18 https://t.co/2C5ICv0YzaHere's how to watch Game 1 of the NBA Finals between the @celtics and @warriors tonight:

https://t.co/L6TbOpsZDGThese @celtics are much closer to the 2015 version of the @warriors than the 2022 one.

They’re young and tough and skilled — not dissimilar to how Curry, Green and Thompson initiated the beginning of their reign.

Who do you think wins game 1?! Will the 2 #RSOP members we are sending to Steph's Birthday in July be celebrating a Championship?! @2974Collection@rayfordyoung @celtics The warriors are way deeper than the celts man come on. The dubs have so many weapons. If it’s not Steph it’s klay. If it’s not klay it’s Poole. If it’s not Poole it’s Wiggins. Tatum has gotta chase klay around all night and score 35 to winKlay Thompson was in the crowd the last time the @celtics played in the NBA Finals — in Los Angeles against the @Lakers.

“And now it’s 12 years later, and I get to play the team that I was rooting against," the @warriors star said.

“It’s amazing.”

Those efforts, along with more recent decisions by LeBron and others, weakened a system that originally treated players like indentured servants.

There’s a few reasons.@DenDenAgain @mcmatt33 @NBAReactz @CelticsRiley @celtics @warriors @NBA I'm aware of all that.

The current CBA is a decades long dispute between owners and the players.

As you may know, Tommy Heinsohn and other Celtics were instrumental in creating a union, by boycotting a key game until certain conditions were met.

GS -3.5, O/U 212.5@NBA @YouTubeTV @celtics @warriors I think Boston has to win game 1,they can lose game 2 but they gotta throw the 1st punch because what if you can't get up from GS's 1st punch, that's a very real thing.

Our personal brand analysis shows Tatum’s #SocialMediaSentiment compared to his on-court player efficiency rating over the 2022 playoffs. https://t.co/iM8QgtoIOi@HypeSada @celtics @NBA I think you somehow completely missed the point of the tweet for Celtics fans that have jobs and need to be up early. Jobless people could stay up as late as they want and sleep late, correct? 

It was a great effort though, nice try.This year’s Finals between the Golden State Warriors and the Boston Celtics is proof that instant gratification by way of trade requests and splashy free agency power plays isn’t the only way to win big in the NBA. https://t.co/op6jwpGX9P via @BenGolliver2021-22 #NBA75 Finals Game 1: Boston Celtics vs. Golden State Warriors

Keeping in mind that this run occurred when Steve Kerr essentially conceded, as the game was clearly out of reach with Curry injured. 

Poole was eating the Boston Celtics alive with the "concession lineup." https://t.co/6buQUI3Dcb@SportsCenter Wasn't the only @celtics win against the @warriors was when Marcus Smart rolled over onto Curry's ankle and he didn't play the rest of the game?🧐

The Warriors Beat Boston without Klay in Boston too, right?🤔Boston Celtics' Marcus Smart and Robert Williams say they are managing injuries, but are ready to go for the start of the NBA Finals...

#NBAFinals@RCasparriello @CelticsRiley @celtics @warriors @NBA The Heat will have the same problem under a hard cap they have now. In fact, elite players may demand even larger salaries.

Most All Stars will go to a borderline playoff team for $40M a year rather than go to the Lakers for $20M.

Instead, I believe some players would want to stay in their home city as one consideration.

I disagree with you on the draft. It’s applied to every professional team sport and has been an accepted concept for fair distribution of talent by the players union.
