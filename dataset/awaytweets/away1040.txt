Both teams started 17-19 17-18 and have been the best in their conference (Celtics) and 2nd best in their conference (Mavs) since then.@STR8Homah @celtics I understand, but thanks can’t help but be concerned that playing in front of those legends wasn’t inspiring/motivating in itself.  Either way, lets hope they carry that feeling into Oracle tonight! ✊🏻@OhioHustlers @celtics That's not what the story is about though. It's about them not having to focus on a game and actually be with those legends to get inspired.@STR8Homah @celtics Yes, clearly.  However, KG visited the team beforehand and if all of these legends didn’t inspire them prior to postgame that’s sad.  Now, no reason we couldn’t have shared that cake sir.@KLawsonPoet @AndreaLoranger4 @not4work99 @ewarren @SenMarkey @AyannaPressley @wutrain @BostonGlobe @celtics That would be a good question for @knightcolumbia@YvanMontgury @HonestLarry1 @MagicJohnson @bernardkingHOF @IsiahThomas @DetPistonsFR @LakersNation @celtics @NY_Knicks_Fr @DallasMavsFr @retro_70s I always wanted the Mark Aguirre ones when I was little but they only made the Bird/Magic ones in youth sizes in the 80’s.

The overall FRAUD can’t and it’s a character flaw and it’s disgusting.@celtics I love how all three of their reactions are like a microcosm of each of their personalities 😂@SPELL_Army @ewarren @SenMarkey @AyannaPressley @wutrain @BostonGlobe @celtics Oh I agree, nothing ever adds up. The same things that for 4 yrs they blame the GOP for is what they are doing now. I am not blind to it hence why I did unenroll from the democratic party. I just can't sit back seeing them only speak and work with those that fit the agenda.@KLawsonPoet @ewarren @SenMarkey @AyannaPressley @wutrain @BostonGlobe @celtics So when they don’t see any of this crystal clear as day anomalies there’s only one answer for it.  From the people who claim to be for YOU!  They are FRAUDSNot my son asking me if leprechauns are Boston Celtics fans 😂😂@warriors @celtics Let's go 🔥🔥@MohantyLink @celtics ts: PammyC1958 🤞🏼@Lakers @Warriors @Celtics There can only be one.@KLawsonPoet @ewarren @SenMarkey @AyannaPressley @wutrain @BostonGlobe @celtics Here’s another one..”gouging at the pump” they say but never once saw the “gouging” by pharma selling jabs and tests nor the gouging by hospitals checking the covid box while their CEO’s took record bonuses. A pandemic mind you. Capitalizing on an international “crisis” by design@SPELL_Army @ewarren @SenMarkey @AyannaPressley @wutrain @BostonGlobe @celtics @EdMarkey Thank you. Don't get me started on Ed Markey - he put the US Attorney forward despite the fact that I reported her impersonating a police officer towards me.@SPELL_Army @ewarren @SenMarkey @AyannaPressley @wutrain @BostonGlobe @celtics They have Charlie cards that can be reloaded but a lot of schools, employers, charities and other organizations give them out. They would have to track every single Charlie card and even that will have way to many variables.@KLawsonPoet @ewarren @SenMarkey @AyannaPressley @wutrain @BostonGlobe @celtics Yes you get a card that you scan.  Places you there albeit yes you could have found it or used a friends card but better than the dude coming in just to assault grandma.  Police have something at least@Noah_Sayed529 @celtics Fitts in Antoine Walker's old jersey.@KLawsonPoet @ewarren @SenMarkey @AyannaPressley @wutrain @BostonGlobe @celtics Also proud of you for at least seeing it as a reg dem   Usually you blocked me by now.  The days of JFK are long gone and people need to realize that.  It’s all about FRAUD more than ever. $56M to give away some iPhones with this @EdMarkey tech inequity FRAUD programs.@SPELL_Army @ewarren @SenMarkey @AyannaPressley @wutrain @BostonGlobe @celtics I dont think they could ever track who is on the bus, way to many variables but I understand what you're saying.@celtics @McDTwin1 Hope they meet in the finals@KLawsonPoet @ewarren @SenMarkey @AyannaPressley @wutrain @BostonGlobe @celtics Ya a reloadable card by cash at cvs or something.  Scan and go.  Now you know who’s riding@SPELL_Army @ewarren @SenMarkey @AyannaPressley @wutrain @BostonGlobe @celtics @TulsiGabbard Yes more people need to call people out, I have and my record shows that but sadly most of these people are connected.@KLawsonPoet @ewarren @SenMarkey @AyannaPressley @wutrain @BostonGlobe @celtics They going through all the trouble making it free you want to do something make it with a fob that deducts 50 cents no cash which also curbs crime. Ripping off the $30 in the container and bus driver gets shot or stabbed. All common sense stuff.  We should know who is riding.@SPELL_Army @ewarren @SenMarkey @AyannaPressley @wutrain @BostonGlobe @celtics You can also load a Charlie card with cash, I mean I would like to know how they pay for gas on the free busses? Taxpayers do and the price of gas is insane and those busses use a lot@KLawsonPoet @ewarren @SenMarkey @AyannaPressley @wutrain @BostonGlobe @celtics It’s opposite world with these people and a hero would call it out.  @TulsiGabbard is the only one with a brain on the left.  More need to follow because it’s getting ridiculous and dangerous.  Talking nuke possible usage first time since 1993 and it wasn’t TRUMP. FRAUDS@celtics We want @isiahthomas if for no other reason than 💚💚👏. May I mention he is a natural scorer! 🪣🪣🪣@NBA @jaytatum0 @celtics sound like them chips with his face on it@SPELL_Army @ewarren @SenMarkey @AyannaPressley @wutrain @BostonGlobe @celtics So if they pay cash?Sending a double-team late in the game against the Boston Celtics was a helpful option for the Dallas Mavericks. 

With how effective Tatum has been as of late, preventing him from having a rhythm and space to operate as a closer was key. https://t.co/LVacM9tXlJ@KLawsonPoet @ewarren @SenMarkey @AyannaPressley @wutrain @BostonGlobe @celtics It’s like ok I defended TB12 during deflate gate too but I knew enough to say ok this is a little off and he probably did take some air out.  There are things just glaring. BLM founders buying mansions, nothing to the black community. Inflation which is creating more crime..@celtics @warriors gonna be a good game tonight@PurplePollo @doctheleader @bears_deluxe @jaydeneick @celtics oh really? well heres me buying this bear... 2 months ago.. https://t.co/40k5DEdSaE@KLawsonPoet @ewarren @SenMarkey @AyannaPressley @wutrain @BostonGlobe @celtics By paying.  The smart thing would be to charge a minimal 50 cents a ride by loading a card that scans.   Then you know who’s on the dam thing and therefore solving crime easier.  Nope not these FRAUDS who claim to want to keep grandma safe.  She’ll be assaulted.@userIDcash @bears_deluxe @jaydeneick @celtics 100% true. He has opened tickets with OpenSea and Bears Deluxe to try to figure out what happened. That bear was not for sale when owned by jaydoebeats check sales from a month ago. Fake sale at 1.0. His bear and ETH were stolen. We have proof of it all.@SPELL_Army @ewarren @SenMarkey @AyannaPressley @wutrain @BostonGlobe @celtics I agree that we need to be looking in our own backyards before preaching about standing united. We just sat here for the last few years hating unvaxed, vaxed, people of different skin tones, cops, teachers etc so I do find it disturbing that they all preach unity now.@doctheleader @bears_deluxe @jaydeneick @celtics simply not true ser.@KLawsonPoet @AndreaLoranger4 @not4work99 @ewarren @SenMarkey @AyannaPressley @wutrain @BostonGlobe @celtics Yep. FRAUDS who in a perfect world would all be in prison.  Promoting rioting by promoting bail funds making violence easier.Ignoring whole city blocks overtaken &amp; federal buildings burning.Leaves door open so a guy in a chewy suit and horns can walk right in then point OMG look!@userIDcash @bears_deluxe This bear was stolen from @jaydeneick  😤 @celtics please get this bear back to the rightful owner @bears_deluxe@SPELL_Army @ewarren @SenMarkey @AyannaPressley @wutrain @BostonGlobe @celtics Tracking? How would anyone be tracked paying to ride public transportation?@SPELL_Army @ewarren @SenMarkey @AyannaPressley @wutrain @BostonGlobe @celtics I mean I have been a registered dem my whole life. Voted dem in the last election, I have since changed based off my interactions with US Attorney Rollins but I just think in general a lot of people are frauds.@SPELL_Army @AndreaLoranger4 @not4work99 @ewarren @SenMarkey @AyannaPressley @wutrain @BostonGlobe @celtics Well they all frauds.@shooter_spike @celtics What depth? We sucked when we were digging deep into the bench and now we don't suck using a smaller rotation.@KLawsonPoet @ewarren @SenMarkey @AyannaPressley @wutrain @BostonGlobe @celtics Notice who subjected their own children to ABUSE as a child was known to be well under the risk but instead have been left with heart problems and they still promoted an unnecessary jab?   FRAUDS https://t.co/UVgz9hSfzy@KLawsonPoet @ewarren @SenMarkey @AyannaPressley @wutrain @BostonGlobe @celtics A FRAUD makes public transportation FREE without sharing the FACT it will create a vacuum for more crime. Harder to find them because no tracking who paid to be on there. Total incompetence but it feels good to them to be able to say FREE as if it’s actually free, when it’s not.@TSKR19 @celtics @TeamProject351 @newbalance Thanks Taylor!Celtics injury update: Boston eyeing 'end of the trip' out west for a possible Aaron Nesmith return #Boston #Celtics #NBA https://t.co/KGMiwAU2Z5@LocalPoliticsis @DARollins @MartyJWalsh @BostonGlobe @RedSox @celtics Hmmmm I thought that was "melanin" on their faces.
