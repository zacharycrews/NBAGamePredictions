  Someone on here described @CollinSexton02 as a more aggressive @BoobieGibson and that is how the @cavs should have handled it.

  More should have been done with him, that he missed out on, because there was another.@_adasz_ @cavs @dariusgarland22 @FuboSportsbook Yooo we happy for you but you cant get nobody in the top 4 to seven games.

Second very impressive long road trip this year, 4-1 so far on this one. 

The schedule eases up a bit, so let's see what this squad can do. What a team. #LetEmKnowI love the Cleveland Cavaliers25-18 @cavs are 9 wins from being the best post era @KingJames team.
As much as it would be nice to see him return home for one last Championship run, Cavs would have to give up too much to make it happen.
Grateful @kevinlove is here to enjoy this season.Not the most beautiful game of all time but the W is all that matters. 4-1 on the road trip now. Let's make it 5-1 in OKC tomorrow, @cavs! 💪🏻

They should be winning this by double digits but bad shots, missed FTs and overall choking is becoming their new normal #heartlesslosers

#anothermissedFT.@cavs make the free throws please. Thanks@cavs And it was all net!! Sheesh! 🔥🔥🔥Can we practice free throws JB??? Wtf?? @cavsThis game, so close...

https://t.co/BM2rGP6EdDMake free throws please. @cavs@cavs cavs will get destroyed in the playoffs if they even make it. They are far too weak mentally to have any chance whatsoever@DreKnott This team is just amazing man, you can genuinely see that everyone of them are having a blast every night they are on the floor. Making @cavs fans proud@cavs don’t stop now…there’s a flea on the runDG's doing a little bit of everything out there 👏

@dariusgarland22 | #NBAAllStar https://t.co/F3S2cC0yuy@cavs Markannen please play better defense, be more agressive. Lets go boys@cavs heartless cavs no longer shoot fts well after their leader was injured....too cowardly and shaky #notadmirable

 How far along would this be if Colin did not get hurt? They had to share the pg spot.

 Hampering growth at the PG position, the way it has been the last couple of years?

  @cavs did both players a disservice in drafting them back to back.@_bigjayy_ @cavs One of the best trades in @cavs history. We love us some @_bigjayy_#DariusGarland is an #NBAAllStar.

#BuzzerBeater #AllStar  #LetEmKnow@cavs @socios D. We should involve Mobley more
E. Garland needs to be more assertive, whether thats with playmaking or scoring
2/2@cavs @socios A. Okoro shouldnt have lost his starting job just because Lamar was doing well
B. Our shaky FTshooting seems to be from fear and nerves after Rubio went down. It seems like they're afraid with no real leader on the floor
C. A playoff team would have pulled away from the Spurs 1/2@cavs Mr. Double-Double@cavs Can the refs call something on the spurs??@cavs Play some perimeter d pls@cavs why are there more likes on this post than RT, do Cavs fans not understand???#JarrettAllen's got himself another double-double!

The Cavs are a leagues best 27-14 ATS. On a 2 game win streak and get a banged up Spurs team. The Cavs size &amp; rim protection will be a problem for the Spurs who score most of their points in the paint.
