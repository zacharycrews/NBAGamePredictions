If you want to be a leader and wanna great you work at craft and get better  each and every year. The bulls have been mediocre for years with your 2nd best player in the team. Good luck winning a playoff series.@chicagobulls @SamSmithHoops Love my team.  üëÄüî¥@chicagobulls i hope you entered playoff this year, and dont die on first round. keep fighting and bring that trophy to locker room again!!! #BullsNation üí™üí™üí™@AccinoSean @chicagobulls @SamSmithHoops Good luck trying to replace the second best player on this team cause you can‚Äôt accept that sometimes players aren‚Äôt perfect.Kyrie's season-high 50 help Nets snap slide at 4 (https://t.co/qWWHLlWR34)

I'm not sure what else they can do. Zo and Vooch are starters. Even Caruso has started some. The last time I checked, starters make a big difference. Sure we should still be winning these, but they do make a big difference.@chicagobulls @SamSmithHoops Go Bullllllllllllsssssssssss@Josh_Frydman @WGNNews @Stacey21King @ZachLaVine @Razorred15 @chicagobulls @GNSportsTV @ScottiePippen Do they support toddlers being interviewed alone??? https://t.co/NQTstBqSUO@chicagobulls @BMOHarrisBank Love this‚ù§@Kufalol @Scepan_ @chicagobulls @SamSmithHoops Y‚Äôall the only fan base that talk about injuries after every game. Lonzo and that bald head Niggah are ROLE players. Yah stars must show upOkay, new rule. We don't talk about the @chicagobulls until they are healthy. THEN we can have constructive conversations about this team and what we can expect from them in the playoffs@Wynton_Mohorn @TheArabZO @chicagobulls @SamSmithHoops You‚Äôre delusional. We beat you 4 fucking times. And in the first 2 games lonzo and Caruso were there. And we had 75% of are team out with Covid. Embiid is 11-0 against the bulls. We never lost in the last 3 years to yall. Y‚Äôall don‚Äôt have talent.‚ÄúI‚Äôve had a lot of barbers, and he‚Äôs number one to me.‚Äù 
Why everyone from @Stacey21King to @ZachLaVine to Snoop Dogg trusts the sure hands of @Razorred15 Terrance Wills for a tight fade and clean cut.

Especially if Caruso, Lonzo, &amp; Patrick Williams play. It's real easy to talk crap when the Bulls 3 best defenders are out right now. You won't be saying sh** when they return.@chicagobulls Stop losing@chicagobulls Every time we face a good team, is a loose@Scepan_ @Kufalol @chicagobulls @SamSmithHoops Every team deals with injuries.
