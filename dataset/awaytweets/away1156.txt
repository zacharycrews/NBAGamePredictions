A hell of a player that never won shit.

To clarify, yes I lost a teaser on the last leg because a healthy Philly couldn’t handle the Detroit Pistons.Today I’m eating Detroit style pizza, listening to Emenem and wearing a Ben Wallace jersey.

Maybe one of the least educated “locks” I’ve ever seen on #GamblingTwitter.

Put the game logs away and watch a game every once in a while. The @DetroitPistons are tough!Detroit’s win last night not only dropped Philly in the standings, it also dropped the Pistons’ lottery odds. 

Pole position for the #1 pick is now held by Orlando and Houston, you know, 2 of the Raps’ final 6 opponents!

The 1995 Houston Rockets are the lowest seed in NBA history (6th) to win an NBA championship.

The Nets can do it, too. 

https://t.co/u9KDt2Yt0W@Yabbit650 I already told my girl you know I'm about to buy a crap load of Michigan, Detroit Lions, Tigers, and Pistons gear right. https://t.co/jHUtNH8XkD@Joey2Puttz @DetroitPistons Pay him everything, draft one of the top 4, profit.Everyone been sleeping on Cade. Obviously a biased pistons fan here, but this guy has been absolutely sensational since the all-star break. 

Cant believe Detroit has a player like this to build around. https://t.co/FOL5Ownro1That JJ Redick clip going viral on the *very same day* that Giannis beats KD on 44/14/6 and Embiid loses to the Detroit Pistons is an all time hilarious instant L 😂@P1STONS_FAN @DetroitPistons I was really debating on this also. I decided to renew by having a small amount owed for next season. There are alot of things that need to changed for loyal members.#GamblingTwitter

@sixers

🚨🤮 #76ers Bad coaching, horrific bench. Harden is washed, and has lost a step. Refs not balling him out anymore. 4-15 is disgraceful. And losing to @DetroitPistons is worse.
@JoelEmbiid leaves w/in 2yrs #factsJoel Embiid and the Philadelphia 76ers react to a bad road loss to the Detroit Pistons after a 4th quarter collapse.  https://t.co/AybjYbydD0@KuKhahil @AshtonDaTrainer I was around for the 2004 run, and even the 2005 run where they changed the rules to keep down the Pistons and we still took it to the last possession in game 7. This feels like that. This team has *it*. #Pistons are for real.

Im loving this whoever is in charge of it. Masterclass job@AshtonDaTrainer Like not even Pistons fans, there's deadass a life and electricity to Detroit and everyone around that I've never witnessed.

Those who were old enough for 2004 can relate, but I wasn't really. This shit is special.@JaylenTatum01 @DaAverageMan @SmittyBarstool Can we do more recent history?Did you happen to catch the professional basketball game 2night? The Pistons of Detroit took on the 76ers of Philadelphia and in the end, the Pistons triumphed by taking a round ball made of leather through a hole. It was a great victoryI really don't think Cade Cunningham or @AshtonDaTrainer fully understands the amount of life and electricity they've injected into Detroit.

I genuinely haven't seen this much hope, fun, enjoyment, and love from all Pistons fans since I can remember watching.@MisterPrez32 @sixers just lost to the @DetroitPistons lol#NBATwitter 03/31/2022

#ROYCunningham #CadeIceWoodThe Sixers entered the night at 46-29 and big favorites in Detroit, a game they needed in their tight race for seeding. But 20-56, even without Jerami Grant, had other plans. Philly had all of its main guys playing and led most of the way, but were flummoxed by a 23-4 Piston run.You see my Pistons tonight? The future is bright! @DetroitPistons #GoPistons@ReachForTheSki @DetroitPistons Bottom 3 are not guaranteed the top three picks, however the bottom three all have the same odds at the top pick, gotta stay in the bottom 3.Detroit Pistons dominate fourth quarter in 102-94 win over 76ers: Game thread replay https://t.co/GY2762roTiDetroit Pistons dominate fourth quarter in 102-94 win over 76ers: Game thread replay https://t.co/Waz0b9iDUGThe Pistons (+375) upset the 76ers

They are 46-30 and moving closer to the 4-5 line of the playoffs.

The @DetroitPistons literally shut down everyone but Embiid.
