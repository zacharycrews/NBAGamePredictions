Heartbreaking loss in the finals last year, only to come back and dominate the following season.12/21/83 – Walter Davis had 40p/2r/5a and shot 2-4 from 3 (the only 3's attempted by either team), but the Phoenix #Suns allowed 28 layups as the Portland Trailblazers (minus Mychal Thompson and Wayne Cooper) won, 109-105. Charles Pittman: 7-7 for career-high 18p. #ValleyProud https://t.co/REak66gTydThe Los Angeles #Lakers (+250) will look to make a statement in this one against one of the best teams in the NBA, the Phoenix Suns (-325) 🤑
