Same reason GM’s who drafted that player expect it. There’s not a single Pistons fan that doesn’t want a draft pick to exceed expectations in time. Killian needs to prove he’s an NBA player. Is that too much 2 expect?"The #Pistons have 25 games to see how @MB3FIVE talent fits, then they’ll get their time in the batter’s box in late June/early July when the draft and free agency offer gaping opportunities to further bolster the roster."

Now come the @RamsNFL across the street tonight at @SoFiStadium.

https://t.co/SzBENpCCr4If the Bengals won tonight, Matthew Stafford would've finessed the Detroit Lions in vain.

Just like how Blake Griffin finessed the Pistons for the Nets and now they're falling apart after tryna copy the 2015-2019 Warriors.@BenVerlander All 4 pro teams should leave Detroit.The Pistons haven't won a Championship since '04. The Tigers last WS was in '84. The Lions haven't won a SB since '57, &amp; the Wings lat Stanley Cup was in '08. Your bro &amp; M.S. had to be traded to win a Championship. I'm a 'gander so no bias .Detroit Pistons and Detroit Lions about to Crazy Next season After Seeing Eminem At the Superbowl 😂😂 

I'm putting a 10a on EACH!!! Soon as the new seasons start! 🙏😂😂I can’t wait for Detroit sports to be back.

Okay, Red Wings and Pistons. Trade your best players so Detroit can win the championships vicariously through you@FuriousGeorge94 Pistons legend Khris Middleton also brought us an NBA title. Truly a golden era for Detroit sports.@KingJames Better then the show in Detroit at pistons game you got tossed.  Which as a Detroit fan, was way overblown, accidentally and you didn't deserve the suspension.  Took the grandson, to see you that day.  He was upset for sure, such is life.  Just keep being the GOAT @KingJames.@RyanSchuiling I feel sorry for kids who are Detroit fans. I had the 84 Tigers, Bad Boy Pistons, Chauncey Pistons, Redwings, Michigan football and basketball. State fans had their championship. My teams won 10 championships and played in what, 19? Kids now have nothing@CarterElliott__ @GoBlueLexi117 @Lions @DetroitPistons @tigers Feels like I’ve been hearing this wrt the Lions for 30 years with nothing to show for itOne day that will be us @Lions @DetroitPistons @tigers@freep Breaking news Isiah Livers got called up from the motor city cruise! @DetroitPistonsI have now lived long enough to see championships win by the Detroit Tigers, Detroit Pistons, Detroit Red Wings, and Matthew Stafford.

On the other hand, Troy has drafted Cade Cunningham and the Pistons are poised to have abundant cap room next summer to add some very nice talent. He also just got Bagley III to address athleticism.Marvin Bagley III plans to 'just be myself' as he lands new opportunity with Pistons #Detroit #Pistons #NBA https://t.co/ULzTHuBF7rWashington Wizards - Detroit Pistons
