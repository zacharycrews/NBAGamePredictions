https://t.co/JNx2EhjgsSHere is what the NBA had to say about the Indiana Pacers fans that LeBron James told referees to eject.  https://t.co/jE9FMNBFcw@j_knode @TaylorTannebaum @jakequery That‚Äôs inaccurate. They are the Indiana Pacers, and yes, I realize this does nothing to help resolve the question at hand. Twitter gonna tweet though.@JTGatlin @LockedOnRockets Great podcast as always Jackson. I agree that Wood is a 5, but Sengun is also a 5 and that‚Äôs a problem. It‚Äôs still the best move to trade Wood unless we wanna be Indiana Pacers south.TIP: Minnesota Timberwolves - Indiana Pacers, 218.5-FT, 1.83 by #tipster McT86 (profit this month: +69.38)
