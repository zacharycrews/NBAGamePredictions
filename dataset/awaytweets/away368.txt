The player the Knicks should be pursuing without hesitation is Dejounte Murray. Solidifies the PG spot &amp; highly productive.

1. New York is, in fact, an "alligator people hellhole." Don't come here.

2. EJ, if your SO isn't familiar with "bing bong," he is not, in fact, a Knicks fan. Maybe he likes the Nets?

The Knicks seem to have returned to their form in October with this performance. Good night!@hopefulmetsfan @nyknicks He played fine for his 20 minutes. Just needs to start consistently knocking down open looks@CocchiaraSam @nyknicks MaybeSpurs came in shooting 63.2% at the rim and 45.3% from short mid-range; tonight they shot 55.9% and 40.9% from those areas, respectively. Knicks’ length mucked up what SA likes to do, and add on the lack of 3-pt shooting and all the offensive rebounds for New York, that’s game.@nyknicks man took Thibs comments personalRJ BARRETT IS BACK!

I agree@KnicksMSGN @RjBarrett6 @nyknicks Need Barrett and Robinson to keep up performances like this.

The moment Randle took that over again it went back to RJ sitting in the corner becoming a 3&amp;D guy@wallyball @nyknicks Am I the only one who believes that @AlecBurks10 at PG is a TOTAL waste of TALENT?#Knicks🚨 UPDATE: Mitchell Robinson - New York Knicks has a Double Double

 Tweet by https://t.co/gwNoMs5GaI https://t.co/ZNBEtfshvK@nyknicks Wtf is Thibs doing? Noel can’t catch a damn ball… the dude is skinnier than a stick and can’t guard anyone outside of the paint…@nyknicks Thibs doesn’t know what hes doing. Changing the five isn’t changing anything. The first unit can’t score. The defense is overall bad. Noel can’t run the D if the guard spots are bad defenders. @507LindaALeudo said Frank would be missed. Robbed of starting 4 years. Now look…@nyknicks We should of kept @ReggieBullock35#KnicksTape does not condone this @nyknicks https://t.co/0tqpYkhZ3v@coachthibz @nyknicks Trust me I hope I'm wrong but this lineup change seemed way to hyped up for just Noel starting@nyknicks This team NEEDS to trade for Myles Turner@nyknicks knicks won’t suck tonight https://t.co/QCywbObo76@nyknicks @sixers @trailblazers @wojespn @NBA 3 team trade: NY gets Dame, Philly gets CJ, Blazers get Simmons and Kemba #NBA #trade #vote@AliBaba_NYC_ @nyknicks He’s also a complete 0 on offense, his one attribute last year was his D and this year it’s been a step back I’d rather start Jericho over him deadass@Ftoe_Snoop @nyknicks @CarisLeVert I don’t think we’ll get that defensive player we need for Kemba prob some role player but then we also need someone who can get a bucket without taking 20 secs of the shot lock 😭@michaelkasdan @wcknicks @SamanicLuka @nbagleague @nyknicks I mean they can find the minutes they just would prefer to loseThe NEW YORK KNICKS CONNECTION. THJ to KP oop!@nyknicks i like RJ but he shouldn't be starting and getting so many minutes@joeimparato0 @nyknicks He’s had 1 good game all year whereas Mitch has had maybe 3 bad games and Thibs is like yea this will solve our problems wtf@nyknicks Thibs we trust. I think with this. We shall aee https://t.co/w4ep5F7X6o@nyknicks Thibs is a funny dude lol@nyknicks Thats f’ing terrible. Geex@rads619 @nyknicks Tom Thibodeau says he’s still mulling starting lineup. 
Seen 8:29 PM@nyknicks Glad scoring got added to starting lineup… https://t.co/3Qo2GGtlRa@rads619 @nyknicks Lmao.. I wish we had Frank back@nyknicks Nerlens Noel replacing Mitch is the “change”. Unreal, absolutely unreal, it’s like one position you just downgraded.@nyknicks WHAT A GAME CHANGING LINEUP CHANGE guys, I think thibs has done good things for us but taking mitch out of starting 5 for Noel who has been literally worse makes 0 sense i can't believe this was the change that was hyped up@nyknicks Nah y’all doing Mitch dirty lmaoooooTonight's starting lineup for the New York Knicks:  Burks, Fournier, Barrett, Randle, Noel https://t.co/bVWH4AMCA2@nyknicks the fact that he’s rlly starting noel is beyond me 🤦‍♂️@nyknicks All that time for what smdh@nyknicks Trade for Myles turner@nyknicks Stupid lineup with nobodies!

When they actually get a chance at the end of the game to throw the ball from the distance, they don't...because it will mess up their shooting percentage. Just dumb...The New York #Knicks should use one of their numerous first round draft picks to acquire Myles Turner from the Indiana Pacers. The dude is a beast protecting the rim, and he can actually step out to drill the three as he’s currently shooting 39.5% from downtown #NewYorkForever@BingBongGuy @nyknicks I’m so excited for this game.
