#LetEmKnow@GDanArtist @Tony_Pesta @cavs @CollinSexton02 Thank you.

 I am reminded of the @cavs 86-92' teams and how they panicked over Ron Harper and shipped him away for the better piece and Harper turned out to be the missing piece the whole time.

 #GoCavs@SimsTazmon @Tony_Pesta @cavs @CollinSexton02 The Cavs last two losses can be attributed to a lack of defensive intensity/focus and not hitting shots at the stripe. That's fixable. No need to upset the apple cart because you think you need better apples.

Terrific young player!@NBAAllStar @cavs @dariusgarland22 The way the cavs are ranked in the East right now is unbelievable! What a turnaround that team has had this season!@vismugabo I agree.

 Right now @cavs are a clever story, this one has to be seen in order to be understood.

  I think this team is the chance to fix the mistakes that were made with the 86-92 squad.

 This time, when we get a Ron Harper, we believe in him as well.

 #GoCavs@DevaronPerry @vismugabo Khris Middleton made it based off performance in last year's Playoffs.

 When @cavs makes a deep run in the playoffs, eyes have to come and figure out why.

  You have to watch this team to get it, because the League has gone "small ball".

 Mobley and Allen, have to be  seen.On this day in sports history February 4, Cleveland Cavaliers Small Forward LeBron James recorded 52 Points, 9 Rebounds, and 11 Assists in a 107-102 win against the New York Knicks in 2009.Cup of Cavs: Cleveland Cavaliers news and links for Friday, February 6 - Fear the Sword https://t.co/9Hp2NIotIg@TheHoopCentral Cleveland Cavaliers@NBAAllStar @cavs @dariusgarland22 Way to go Darius!!!@cavs @dariusgarland22 @RMFieldHouse @NBAAllStar Yes Sir üíØüí™üèø@sweet @cavs @NBA Good project2003 upper deck lebron james national accolades #3 Cleveland Cavaliers - https://t.co/Iyzl2DCv4x

Who can ever forget The Miracle at Richfield? Those early @cavs years, good stuff-Carr, Russell, Smith, Chones, Thurmond‚Ä¶#Cavs #LetEmKnowMy @NBA must watch teams:

Cleveland Cavaliers
Memphis Grizzlies
Toronto Raptors
Minnesota Timberwolves
Charlotte Hornets

What are yours? https://t.co/BA1N6gqbLC@Tony_Pesta Team is near the All-Star break; they will get a break and practice time.

 Young Team in this position for the first time, how do we know, @cavs don't already have the answer on the Team?

 @CollinSexton02 back for Playoffs?

 Best Pickup, @cavs can make.

#GoCavsIf @Cavs try Denis Schroder ill be sick. Dude hasnt improved much, imo. Much rather have a better shooter like Eric Gordon.@Cavs if garland and allen arent allstars we riot@YaronWeitzman "Yes, the Cleveland Cavaliers, in a season in which they don‚Äôt have LeBron James, are, as of this writing, 10 games over .500 and just two games out of first place."

For many of us, we were wondering how but this has been one of the best re-tools in recent years üëÄReacting to All-Star reserves and opening up the Mailbag on the @ChaseDownPod on the @cavs Youtube!

Come hang and talk about the selections and get your questions in the chat!
