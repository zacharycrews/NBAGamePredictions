Franz Wagner (Orlando Magic) over 3.5 assists 1.83 (2U)

Orlando should be able to fight vs Clippers without PG.
I am expecting Wagner to play more than 33 minutes today and should get over this assistline. This young lad is underrated.

Defend someone. After giving up 130 to the Orlando Magic Wednesday at Golden 1 Center, the Kings' defense was downright awful again in Charlotte. The Kings gave up 69 points in the first half. They improved in the second half, but still allowed the Hornets to shoot 55.2%.@OrlandoMagic @thats_G_ Can you send him back to Denver please? 😭@OrlandoMagic Can't wait 🔥On tap for this weekend in LA (going to all four events)

Saturday: Clippers hosting the Orlando Magic

Sunday: Going to both the Giants @ Chargers + Lakers hosting the Orlando Magic

Monday: Clippers host the Phoenix Suns

Tuesday: 20th birthday https://t.co/k9CjoQpvEv@TyWhat @OrlandoMagic @thats_G_ Yeah. What it makes me think is that if you can't stand out on a tanking mediocre team full of young players and rookies...what the heck you'd have to offer to a good one?
I just want him to continue gettin' better to receive at least something in return for him.@OrlandoMagic @thats_G_ Can we have him back please@TyWhat @OrlandoMagic @thats_G_ Did I say that he should?
But as far as I know as an expiring contract player, the best way to get a good deal from a team next season is at least to show something interesting on court. Even if you're playing for a really mediocre team..@GetNickG Package Bamba and T Ross... What could @OrlandoMagic get?😁@T_Munoz613 Welcome to the life of an @OrlandoMagic fan. #TragicGot offered free tickets to an @OrlandoMagic game at the @AmwayCenter but the math doesn't work out when they charge $16 for a pint of domestic. @AmwayUS@TheyOnTJ @thats_G_ @OrlandoMagic more efficient than wardell ong@GregAnthony50 @OrlandoMagic 100%.
