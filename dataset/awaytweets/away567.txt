NEXT GAME: Saturday January 8th VS Milwaukee BucksComing off our best game of the season and riding the season’s first back-to-back wins, the #Pistons got taken out of it early tonight against the NBA’s second-highest scoring team.

@Keith_Langlois 🗞️ : https://t.co/LISnxCLIIxNBA @DetroitPistons at @hornets, Wednesday, January 5, 2022 @NBA @NBAstats #gamecharts #dataviz #nft https://t.co/LdZ29lpbye@the_mayo_muslim @DetroitPistons @CadeCunningham_ @MELOD1P Different circumstances. #LaMeloBall was playing against Dwane Casey tonight, not Cade Cunningham. Let me know when opposing teams are betting the house on stopping Cade, and then we can compare. #NBAAllStar #Hornets #NBA #NBA75Check out  #Detroit  #Pistons Adidas #NBA Men's Ultimate Red #basketball  Tee Shirt XL New   #adidas https://t.co/Zz3lcZRatq via @eBayI am willing to say this:

This team is really close. They need to win. Saturday against Detroit is a must-win for this group.

I am sure the Pistons feel the same way.@DetroitPistons @SaddiqBey @BallySportsDET Just a bad man having ANOTHER bad ass game. #Pistons@AhmadMonk Malik Monk was in the Pistons mock Draft. He should have been a Piston. Detroit didn’t Trade. But they should have drafted him. But, then they would messed up and traded him. (My bad. Correction for an earlier tweet).@DetroitPistons @iam_killian @BallySportsDET Nice@DetroitPistons @TreyLyles @CadeCunningham_ @j_josh11 Pistons shoot 47% and lose by 29. Hornets couldn’t miss. Ridiculous.Its weird how people forget that Dennis Rodman played for the Pistons and won 2 championships, rebounding champion and was DPOY in Detroit long before he was ever on the Bulls.
All so they never have to mention Isiah.@DetroitPistons @TreyLyles @CadeCunningham_ @j_josh11 yeah thats more like it@DetroitPistons took a pretty bad loss tonight, but @CadeCunningham_ held his own and matched up well with former #ROTY @MELOD1P. Sucks to lose but focused on the future and I like what I’ve been seeing.🚨Words for @detroitbadboys🚨

Detroit has now lost 14-straight against Charlotte. 

Post game recap for tonight’s game between the Hornets and Pistons. https://t.co/4dZcrnVuZv@DetroitPistons @TreyLyles @CadeCunningham_ @j_josh11 Our defense was atrocious 140 pts giving up smh@theInspector37 @DetroitPistons @Kia When I said lyles had a good game I thought I saw 17 points and 17 rebounds oops it was 7. He should have been back up to Garza@BGB2187 @DetroitPistons @TreyLyles @CadeCunningham_ @j_josh11 Last*@BGB2187 @DetroitPistons @TreyLyles @CadeCunningham_ @j_josh11 Will he didn’t play in the 15 minutes of the game because we were getting washed@DetroitPistons @TreyLyles @CadeCunningham_ @j_josh11 I had to turn this shit off before the end of the first half bro this was breaking my heartAs Hornets fans leave the Spectrum following a 140-111 win over the Detroit Pistons, they start chanting "Fire Rhule."Dwane Casey , coach of The Detroit Pistons should be fired, yes, the team is terrible, but the lack of effort and defense is unacceptable 🏀@DetroitPistons @TreyLyles @CadeCunningham_ @j_josh11 PLAY LUKA GARZA!!@LOrangeMusic @CrownClubCLT @DetroitPistons never had the support around him that he needed to thrive.@DetroitPistons @TreyLyles @CadeCunningham_ @j_josh11 can i just be shot?@theInspector37 @DetroitPistons @Kia Potter shouldnt have gotten minutes over luka! Casey isnt the brightest coach and it shows even as a tanking team. Even tho Lyles had a "good game" idk if he should have started over Garza. I would be playing our young devolvement guys if the future not the 10 day contract player@DetroitPistons @TreyLyles @CadeCunningham_ @j_josh11 Cade with 3 points in the second half….@hornets  beat @DetroitPistons  by 15 in the 2nd half - see how you have to know the difference when to take the -1.5 rather +1.5 (i stated I like betting +1.5) but in this case hornets was the play https://t.co/OpcSrr2yuZ@DetroitPistons @TreyLyles @CadeCunningham_ @j_josh11 we own y’all 💀@phpwastooshort @DetroitPistons @TreyLyles @CadeCunningham_ @j_josh11 Nice@DetroitPistons @TreyLyles @CadeCunningham_ @j_josh11 The Hornets when they play us https://t.co/EGujaIC1m0@DetroitPistons @TreyLyles @CadeCunningham_ @j_josh11 LOOK AT KELLY "STEPH "KLAY THOMPSON" CURRY" OUBRE JR ONE MORE TIME https://t.co/UEjbeuaufe@DetroitPistons @TreyLyles @CadeCunningham_ @j_josh11 Absolutely embarrassing preferred watching this team when it was full of G league players at least we showed more fight@RachelIsBoss87 @CrownClubCLT @DetroitPistons I miss rufus@DetroitPistons @TreyLyles @CadeCunningham_ @j_josh11 Did y’all get the Josh Jackson Miles Bridges jersey swampHORNETS WIN!
