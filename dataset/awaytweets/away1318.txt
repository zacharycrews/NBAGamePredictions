And follow @AlSaracevic for updates throughout the Finals. https://t.co/1qWBeRnBJH@SriniMaama16 And perhaps way too early n Curry will b in no hurry to concede, but The Boston Celtics might b on their way to their first title in a long time if d fourth quarter performance of the first game s anything to go by as they did in may-june of 1986  !@celtics I really like the outfits, they look really good on them. I'm excited for the finals! I been a fan of Al - Horford for several of years, I'm rooting for the Celtics to win the NBA finals! Please don't let me down! #CelticsVsWarriorsThe GS Warriors keys to victory against the Boston Celtics (G2) are similar to game 1:
1. Guard the Corner 3 (don't turn your back)
2. Match the Celtics' physicality
3. Play Steph Curry 40+ minutes unless he's hurt
4. Attack the basket on offense
5. Jordan Poole, pass or shootAhhhh snapppola... few more minutes till the #fab4 @NBAonABC for game 2...@warriors vs @celticsWatch NBA Finals 2022 : Golden State Warriors vs Boston Celtics Live Streams Online

the law prohibiting homicide worked?

In NBA Finals history, only two teams have won the first two games on the road:

1993 Bulls
1995 Rockets

Both won the championship.

#NBAFinals #AllAbout18@NBA @celtics Not gonna mention this guy? https://t.co/c2jJjPexzB@celtics tonight is playing like your lives depend on.Try not to fall behind by that huge margins.The mentality should be to stay in front the whole game.White should be on Curry.Game 2 Tonight (NBA Finals) 

I think that the Boston Celtics defence will get it done tonight 

Even if Steph curry drop 45 points tonight, it might still not be enough to beat The Celtics tonight. I just feels that they have too much powers offensive and defensively...Marcus Smart directly affects the fortunes of the Boston Celtics. He could have taken the low road, but his beloved late mom, Camilla, set him on the right course. She is the unseen presence adjacent to Coach Ime Udoka on the bench.
https://t.co/M3e6rfszXF@NBA @celtics Derrick white acquisition for nothing. Brad stevens in upper management role. Ime coach was massive. Depth and bench.@NBA @celtics If the Celtics win it’s a respectful championship they believe in there team and believe the process they did not need no superteam to win. They believe in there own system and team idc who wins at the end of the dayZarba is ass. Brothers can be a hit or miss.
We'll see how the @Celtics players play through calls. https://t.co/p6b23tuaWkBoston Celtics or Warriors ?

⚪🟢 @celtics &amp; @warriors 🟡🔵Y'all, I was talking to a guy at the bar &amp; he brought up how much money he lost in the playoffs &amp; in game 1 of the finals. He says to me "you wouldn't understand, I'm sure you don't watch sports." I chuckled and said "@celtics are 3 away from the ship..." he walked away 😔😭🤣@Actualsenpai47 @BleacherReport @celtics Release the marine before her!! She’s irrelevant af compared to the marine and what he has done for the US.@taylorcsnow @jaytatum0 @celtics And he made sure practice started at 8:24. And he curled a 24-pound barbell 81 times. And he spoke Italian in the post-practice presser #tatum #kobe🏀 Jogo 2 das Finais da NBA 🔥

It's far more likely that C's win at least another one on the road than 2 in a rpw at home. It's not impossible but given how the C's performed so far in the playoffs, I'd say, that is more accurateAfter a stunning opener to the NBA Finals, @celtics 🤜💥🤛 @warriors‼️ Will the ☘️ take a 2️⃣◾0️⃣ lead or will the Dubs even the series❓ The 🔮 has some 💭 on Game 2️⃣...

It ain’t corny to pay respect to passed friends.The Boston Celtics will try to take a 2-0 series lead tonight over the Golden State Warriors.

In NBA Finals history, only two teams have won the first two games on the road:

1993 Bulls
1995 Rockets

I can't wait for the second game. I don't care who will win (after Giannis' elimination) but I want the series to reach in game 7. Have a nice day my friend@celtics of course they are with her because they are all the same. dont do drugs and you do not have to do time, simpleI was a huge Boston Celtics fan when I was a kid.  Then I naturally became a Buffalo Braves fan.  After they left Buffalo, I was a minor Celtics fan again, until the Raptors came along. Never a Golden State Warrior fan. I really hate the way Curry chews on his mouth guard.@FTX_Chinese @warriors @celtics Great project

Certainly. But they didn't make it to the final. In that sense, I chose to see the Celtics as this season's winner. It's a big battle, but they hold on. I hope. GSW is hard.Odds to win NBA Championship at @BetMGM.

Kyrie challenged Kobe to a one on one as a rookie. He and others were trying to replace Kobe. Tatum simply honors and thanks him. Kobe himself worshipped Jordan from whom he learned all his moves through film only. You guys need to quit.Derrick White not offered a DI scholarship.

He had one championship more than Kobe and as many titles with the Lakers as Kobe. He also multiple times was blocks and rebounds leader. He also (still) holds the record for most points in an NBA career ever. So picking Kobe is just coz u never saw Jabbar play@sixandzero23 @taylorcsnow @jaytatum0 @celtics This must be a Boston thing. But what's wrong with showing love and respect for this generation's MJ. Kobe did it, worked out well for him. Maybe they should've drafted him instead of Walker.@itmekaralee @celtics #AllAbout18  let’s go!!Tonight, we return for some more dub nation tears!🙏🏻
