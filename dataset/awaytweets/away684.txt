Even the Pistons team being built at Woodward Sports. Great interaction, insight, opinions etc. https://t.co/kewNf2w6Ci@Shakabrodie this subject was on Detroit sports radio. Most likely the Pistons will get a top 3 pick in the upcoming draft. Would you trade that pick unprotected to the pacers in return for Sabonis. I think pairing him with Cade would be a great duo.
