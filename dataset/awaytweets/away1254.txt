https://t.co/qMUnxMiTjv@TomSelleck420 @Evan84646099 @CallieCaplan At the moment Utah has home court advantage. But it’s just a must win if the mavericks want an edge on the series. Same with Utah though with Luka most likely coming back game 4, and like you said, Dallas also having home court advantage games 5 and 7.▪️ Jalen Brunson went off for 41 PTS in Game 2

Glad the team had confidence he will be back by Saturday. Let’s get this win @dallasmavs@BleacherReport @wojespn I Love you Luka, but I don't think we can't win the series if you don't play today. It is over @dallasmavs @mcuban @luka7doncic. It is time to start preparing for the off season. With a broken heart, I don't think we can't beat them if Luka don't play today. 😭😭😭😭@BibsCorner Not drafting Giannis. Easily number 1. Sure getting Luka now "makes up" for it. But there will always be the "what if" where in an alternate reality, Dallas Mavericks are the dynasty with Giannis, Luka, DSJ, and where Dirk had like 3 rings at least@willbchill @dallasmavs @Mavs_FFL All time classic shirt.

@ZoneSportsNet | @kslsports https://t.co/L6iYZw3D4NIn my opinion, the Phoenix Suns will still win this series in 6 or 7 games. However, they’ll need Booker back if they end up playing the Dallas Mavericks in the 2nd round.Today's NBA Consensus (So Far):

Golden State Warriors 64%
Memphis Grizzlies 60%
Dallas Mavericks 59%

Mavericks/Jazz Over 65%
Warriors/Nuggets Over 64%
Grizzlies/Timberwolves Under 55%Voyager x Dallas Mavericks Fan Appreciation Day 2022 https://t.co/72fZpYDZhA via @YouTubeGOOD LUCK TONIGHT ⚡️🙌👏🥳 
@SDinwiddie_25 @dallasmavs 
#breinfuelathlete #MAVS #Playoffs #dinwiddie https://t.co/74drOiqJSQThe Dallas Mavericks, the Suns possible next opponent, are 50/1 to win the NBA title https://t.co/oqh2xptpNWShould still be fine against the Pelicans.  Playing the Mavericks would be tough if Luka is on the court and Booker isn't, but I'm not convinced Dallas gets by Utah.

I think a cool concept for a new hat could be a mavs colored hat and have the two L’s that are upside down(aka 77’s) could be a different color than the DA &amp; AS on the hat so it highlights the 77.
