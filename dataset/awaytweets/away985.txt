With the 31st pick the Orlando Magic select Harrison Ingram 

Ingram is a 6’8 point forward with a strong frame. Not a freak athlete but has good size and can guard multiple positions and is very skilled. https://t.co/27a8QvmGEG@OrlandoMagic @wendellcarter34 Someone tell cole Anthony.

#phoenixsuns #orlandomagic #nba https://t.co/BqTi4NaFDk@TheFullTimeDad @FullTimeHoops1 No doubt true and I agree but it does seem like the Top team gets to play the  Lakers and the B team is playing the Orlando Magic.The Magic lost by 3 tonight. Cole Anthony was -13 and Markelle Fultz was +9. So why didn't Fultz play in crunchtime since it was tied w/ 2 mins left and Anthony isn't a real PG? I don't know! I guess Orlando was stealth tanking? They play way better w/ Fultz it seems likeHappy birthday to Kenny the jet smith of the Houston Rockets #kennythejetsmith #kennythejet #sacramentokings #atlantahawks #houstonrockets #detroitpistons #orlandomagic #denvernuggets https://t.co/znXJPNnGgP@OrlandoMagic @MarkelleF So goodThe Phoenix Suns fend off a gutsy Orlando Magic comeback!

Like when the Lakers are in the NBA finals that’s exactly what the networks want. They don’t want the Oklahoma City thunder playing the Orlando MagicOrlando’s been in the bonus since the 8:45 mark in the 4th quarter, and is having a lot of success driving to the rim 

..yet there’s been several three-point attempts down the stretch here when Orlando is 6 of 36 from three on the night.

Magic down 93-86 with 4:56 left.18/12 for Wendell… 4:50 in the 4th and he still hasn’t played in the 4th 

Your coach sucks @OrlandoMagicThree-point shooting tonight:

Landry Shamet: 6-for-9

Orlando Magic: 6-for-36@MagicGaming @OrlandoMagic @AmwayCenter @Snubby21 @May__GT @JonahEdwards_ @BigMFReign @NoKappx @uncool_matty Potts Jackson and crew looking splendid https://t.co/GbULtFq8yq@bhop2112 @OrlandoMagic @SHAQ would help@OrlandoMagic LOSE THE GAME WE WANT A GOOD PICK..Payne and Shamet are 9 of 13 from three so far tonight, just killing every Orlando comeback. 

The Magic are 6 of 34 as a team. 

Suns lead 90-84, 6:39 left in the 4th quarter.I’m not taking a knee motion that almost always ends in something tearing lightly. That’s very embarrassing at a professional level @nba @OrlandoMagicALERT: New high roller bet posted!

Wendell Carter Jr.’s leading Orlando with 18 points and 12 rebounds. Markelle Fultz has 10 points, 4 assists and 3 rebounds in 16 minutes. 

Phoenix, led by Deandre Ayton (17 points and 14 rebounds) has five players in double figures.Last week I was in Orlando and heard about the "magic" of Disney and was intrigued to go for my first time, but now I say #boycottdisney and Gay Gay Gay.@OrlandoMagic @DavisGB1 @BuffaloBills @UCFKnights @UCF_Football Win pls@IcyScottieV2 @gourfish @BammyBurner I think he means by "media attention" Orlando isn't much different from those three I just mentioned, out of all 4 Cleveland has gotten the most media attention, but I don't think Franz should be top 3 ROTY bcuz of he's on the Orlando magic, then what about Cade then?ALERT: New high roller bet posted!

Me: First off, it’s the Magic &amp; no one on Orlando can push him around like Valencuinas &amp; Mitch Robinson did. Second, DA literally said it was a problem and he needs to do better. Third, the team focused on it since the Bucks game.@OrlandoMagic @franzboogie @NBA_de @umichbball @jubjub388 we gonna have a perennial 50/40/90Not sure if anyone gets to see the Orlando Magic halftime show with this man and a dog but, okay I see you.https://t.co/iebDfx6c0DSay Hello to the Brazilians in the house!!! #MagicTogether @OrlandoMagicGonna need @OrlandoMagic to bring Scooby back for every game 🥺🥰 #MagicTogether https://t.co/hjplGJNZypThis Orlando magic half time show is goatedOrlando magic halftime show- 10 Cool, 10 Fun@OrlandoMagic @jamahlmosley please stop ‘experimenting with lineups’ it’s killing my vibeHalftime: Suns 53, Magic 43. 

Franz Wagner makes a buzzer-beating layup with an assist from Cole Anthony at the end of the half to reduce Orlando's deficit to 10. 

Magic shooting just 35.4%. Suns only have 3 turnovers. 

Wendell Carter Jr.: 11 points (5 of 7) and 7 rebounds.@_dannyko Poverty franchise. Orlando Magic betterHalftime em Orlando. Suns sem CP3 e Booker 53x43 Magic.
