#takenote | @kslsportsTyreke Evans ➡️ Herd/Bucks. Let’s go! Nice pickup for Milwaukee. 

If Evans is even remotely the player he was back in Memphis/Indy, before his eventual suspension, he can give us a pop off bench. Easily could get 7-13 points with looks he’d be getting.

Nice to see they're back.@KPJsWorld Miami don’t worry me, we have two unguardable players and their offense doesn’t move me. As for Milwaukee, you saw what KD and Kai did to them last year and imo the Bucks have got worse this year@Bucks So who do we get now?@Bucks Still same Bud offense and Defense though.. Team still can score to keep pace when Buds 3s aren't falling and the defense can't stop teams obvious plans to beat the Bucks by shooting 3s and then sit back and watch Bucks miss their 3s and then eventually self destruct. 🙄After missing a combined 83 games, the Milwaukee Bucks will welcome Brook Lopez and George Hill back to the lineup against the Utah Jazz. #FearTheDeer https://t.co/VzA85pYYI3@An_TonioB @rashadburner @Bucks A soul for a soul@Bucks Bembry get well dog!Milwaukee Bucks Medical Update https://t.co/f2a9rKzkUO @BucksMilwaukee Bucks Medical Update https://t.co/m7AW64YkAx @Bucks@Bucks Remember Bud is still the coach and the team doesn't play smart basketball at all..😉Nearly six months after he last played a game for the Milwaukee Bucks, center Brook Lopez will return to the lineup Monday night, the team said.
