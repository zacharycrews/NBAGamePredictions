@BrooklynNets @nyknicks  #NBA #basketball https://t.co/tphNmdLOBp@Btruetolife @nyknicks @boxand21 This is a sensible trade for both teams IF Randle wants out right away. Portland will make a play for Randle but will by no means give up Simons. Accept the expiring and see what you have in Little, maybe try to finagle a pick.
