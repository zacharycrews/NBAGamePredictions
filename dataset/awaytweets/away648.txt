What seems to be happening with the kids is that they’ve been running more action to get everyone involved and now the ball is hopping.

The rotation now gets to get their reps and then KD/Joe return.@LastDanceSEAN @BrooklynNets The cavs want Harris but they not giving up Mobley. How about a 3 team trade.
