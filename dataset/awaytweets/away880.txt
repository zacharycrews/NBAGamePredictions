Take the Dallas Maverick - 2.5 today and I like Delaware NCAAB..but check the page out everyday I got plenty plays. And I'm into #Crypto since 2017Why do I love #doge so much? I can spend it at tons of businesses that #AcceptDoge, big names including @Tesla, @dallasmavs and @AMCTheatres. Easy to transfer between wallets and tip bc of low tx fees (less than $.01). And it’s fun! Currency doesn’t have to be complicated. https://t.co/fFtYVmCD8L@Blabbit_ @ShaquilBarrett @dallasmavs I will say ultimately if we still had Seth we likely wouldn’t have gotten Bullock and I prefer Bullock who is a beast on defense unlike Curry but is also a sniper from 3 lol@ShaunTopshot @ChewieWoolf the teams themselves should be rewarding the fans with the best collections for their team.
