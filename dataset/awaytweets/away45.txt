#TheLoganWay🔵⚪️ https://t.co/Uw75B1Mo6NHere’s an #NBA Week 1 takeaway that I can’t seem to wrap my head around:

The Detroit Pistons shot less than 20% (19.6%) from three during their first two games of the season

They’ve currently made only 11-of-56 three-point attempts

🤯🤯🤯That Lonzo block on Isaiah Stewart reminds me of the one Lebron James laid on Tiago Splitter of the Spurs. #Lonzoball #lonzoballblock #lebronjames #miamiheat #tiagosplitter #sanantoniospurs #chicagobulls #detroitpistons #isaiahstewart https://t.co/N5paOLT0YaThe @DetroitPistons @OrlandoMagic need a bull like @isaiahthomas https://t.co/Re8HBDNrU6@Eric__Smith Two of the best @Eric__Smith @ctsbulls  very appreciative of being able to have you both on as guest's on Live With CDP, even through I'm a life long @DetroitPistons fan, wish the @Raptors and @chicagobulls great season's in 2021/2022.🏀 #NBA@BallySportsDET @DetroitPistons @TMobile How about get on dish network so the fans can watch games that would be awesome.The @DetroitPistons head south to Hotlanta for a date with the Hawks. 🏀

This sucksIn the Eastern Conference, only one team - the Detroit Pistons - have the 0-2 record like the #Clippers do in the West. Its a painful start #ClipperNation@mlb_things @DetroitPistons @SaddiqBey @TreyLyles @KellyOlynyk At least they a lot more relevant than the Cubs. 😂cade cunningham will hurry it up and make your detroit pistons debut  asap.When will we see the new jersey? @DetroitPistonsI repeat could never @DetroitPistons@DetroitPistons why didn’t get green  smh 🤦🏿‍♂️@DetroitPistons @WNBA @chicagosky That’s @DePaulHoops too#Detroit #Pistons: The Canadian connection.  ...
