@Timberwolves -4.0 (-110)
@chicagobulls -4.0 (-108)

Going into this season the Mavs were clearly viewed as the better team over the Bulls. Many didn't believe that Derozan would work in Chicago. Add in the fact that Bulls have arguably been the most injured team this season-Chicago May #wheat -3%, Matif -2%...shipments from Russian ports are on the rise. The market watches Ru-Ukra talks today (not sure about any progress). Reversed H&amp;S may help bulls.

I mean if I was the @chicagobulls I wouldn't.... 😂.
