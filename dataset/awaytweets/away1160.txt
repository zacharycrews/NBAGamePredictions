#Basketball #CharlotteHornets #NationalBasketballAssociation #NBA #NBAEasternConference #NBAEasternConferenceSoutheastDivision #NorthCarolina https://t.co/TvbSWzFHIqThe exciting @NBA action continues on SABC Sport tonight with @sixers vs @hornets this evening (2 April 2022) at 20:00 On @Official_SABC1, SABC DTT and also available on @TelkomONE

#MzansiSlumDunk https://t.co/qxV1HoHwqgPhilly/Charlotte is a prime example to let the early money come in on the Hornets, bet that line down, then we hit Philly.

Think this is a good bounce back spot for Philly. Lots of bets will come in on the Hornets + the points.
