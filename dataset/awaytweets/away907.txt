Although listed as questionable for Sunday's matinee against the Utah Jazz, Holiday could attempt to make a run at suiting up. https://t.co/ttmcfU9VXd@Gameoverluke Yeah, lately I’ve been seeing posts about my club, obviously as I follow them, and Essendon, same in the BBall.. so much Utah Jazz stuff.. don’t follow any NBA teams so unusual@utahjazz @spidadmitchell @BucketsONeale00 @JordanClarksons @youngwhiteside @udoka35 @44Bojan make the game counts guys...23 W to finish the regular season...is made up game mode now the rest of the way..Godbless..Go Jazz!!!Next up we have the Utah Jazz! 💯 https://t.co/SUDIcwsFrd@alex_nelson24 @utahjazz @KSLcom Thanks for the thought!

Here’s one of mine 👇🏽 https://t.co/kl9LBLnYah@ChrisGourley8 @Kyler_Johnson @rudygobert27 @utahjazz @spidadmitchell Sounds like you and Draymond should hangout 🤦🏻Why would any team run pick and roll to intentionally get @rudygobert27 on ball defense? 

There's not a player in the league that is going to shoot BETTER with Gobert guarding them than &lt;Insert Player Here&gt;

https://t.co/FylcU5XUMtIt 100% looked like @rudygobert27's Advantage to me! @utahjazz  https://t.co/WH6CK25fMn@ToruYanoFanAcct As a lifelong resident of Utah and a fan of it's only major sport team the Utah Jazz. I feel your pain. Also as a 49er fan. They've won super bowls. Just not in any of the years since I became a fan. 😂@DustinT_NBA The nice thing about Rudy's progress is that he is more convincing as a perimeter defender, and nobody else, not even Royce lol, has demonstrated defensive improvement

The big key is to find, develop and play a wing rotation that can defend; see House, Paschall, Butler

NOLA, KC, Chicago, New York, MAYBE Memphis or STL- these are the cities that can pull off the Jazz name.  

For Lakers? Minnesota, Cleveland, Buffalo, Chicago, Milwaukee, Detroit, and Salt Lake City.Suns looking to find footing without Chris Paul, host Jazz  #NBA

I also see a head-case ball-hog being pwned by Rudy
