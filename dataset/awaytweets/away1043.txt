Not sure I can justify taking anyone other than Chet first if I’m the Pistons. Yeah he’s got his question marks, but so does every other top prospect. Detroit needs the highest upside guy and he’s it.Championship matchup about to begin. The Detroit Pistons vs the Orlando Magic! Who ya got?Pistons Update:

Cade Cunningham (non-Covid illness) - OUT

Rodney McGruder (left hamstring strain) - AVAILABLE

Detroit will start Joseph, Hayes, Bey, Bagley, Stewart.

Be specific.Provide some evidence instead of blatantly lying like you always do.

Better yet, provide video evidence from actual games.  Show how the Pistons were "so bad" in 1990. If the East was "so bad", why did Detroit sweep the Blazers IN PORTLAND?@MythNix @216SuperBrowns @Benzene21 @PreKobeEra @2_skeptic @OMasood8842 @ASopaFlores714 @LyleSpencer18 @Johnnybezgood31 @babygetlit @adamOsaussies @nbarealist23 @DMan_4523 @Jimmyd134 @rsandns @BIG_Brandon_BCG @TrevisScott @IGGYPOPS07 @Tuffadan @stickyfingersFR Pistons won all 3 games in Portland during the 1990 Finals. How exactly would giving the Blazers homecourt help them against Detroit?

The difference was one game either way.

Pistons were 40-14 vs the East, 19-9 vs the West.
Blazers were 41-15 vs the West, 18-8 vs the East.Congratulations to MoonManiac who moved up 12 spots to take #8 on the Detroit Pistons team leaderboard.

How did the tiebreaker "help" the Pistons exactly? 

You're a lying fraud who doesn't watch games.@eddieh33 @BulletClubIta When???Pistons beat Jordan ass as a team while he would drive the lane going to the hole,it was called the Jordan Rule and guess what,he fought back!!!6 chips later.🙄🤡
