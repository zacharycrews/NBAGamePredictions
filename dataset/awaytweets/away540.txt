https://t.co/lnbHI9zakW@rockhettired @HoustonRockets This bullshit February 6th??@alperennsengun @HoustonRockets You make a move on the low post, and the audience instantly stands up. They already care so much about the media and the audience, and everyone thinks that the league is all about the show. I try to show myself as much as possible in this show.The Houston Rockets James Harden had a blind fold on during the game.@alperennsengun @HoustonRockets Sengun: I'm great with everyone, my nickname is Alpi. I hear them shouting "Alpi, Alpi" all the time. Everything is very different here compared to Turkey. On the way to the locker room, people want your signature and you talk to the fans. ++@alperennsengun @HoustonRockets Q: How is your communication with the Houston fans? You soon became a phenomenon in Houston‚Ä¶Houston Rockets sanction Porter and Wood with one¬†game https://t.co/bLMuBgRTv3@JordansNext_ @HoustonRockets Bro I just got the same email üò≠@AlecoNFT @StonerApeClub Tasks done amigo. Let‚Äôs get dem stoner apes to the mooooon. Hot box that rocket shipü§£ü§£

‚ÄúHouston! What were we talking about?‚Äùü§£ü§£@alperennsengun @HoustonRockets Our contact with Hakeem did not continue after that little talk, as we have been away all the time lately. I'll talk to Lucas when I get back, arrange a meeting with Hakeem.@alperennsengun @HoustonRockets As for the communication between us‚Ä¶ He congratulated me after a match. He said to me, "I like your footwork very much, I'll show you some moves." I said "always". After all, John Lucas and Hakeem are good friends. ++@alperennsengun @HoustonRockets Sengun: He has already worked a lot with the Houston bigs in the past, with Yao Ming, etc. But over time, as the system changed and there were no other good bigs in Houston, he stopped coming by.
Of course, I want to work with him. After all, we are talking about Hakeem. ++@alperennsengun @HoustonRockets Q: It's time to ask Hakeem Olajuwon here. You mentioned that you could work with him one day, and there has been a dialogue between you.@alperennsengun @HoustonRockets you play away, you leave as soon as the match is over, you go home at 3 at night, the next evening you have a match again. It's an incredible pace.@alperennsengun @HoustonRockets My body got used to this pace now I feel better.
Of course, there are ups and downs, it's impossible not to get tired in the weeks when there are back-to-back matches. Sometimes it happens like this: ++@alperennsengun @HoustonRockets He was protecting me from getting injured. Of course, I wanted to play, and I wanted to take more time, but sometimes you can feel bad(physically) after a game when you take more time‚Ä¶ When we consider the current situation, we played 30 games. ++@alperennsengun @HoustonRockets Sengun: Christian Wood was playing around the rim but I was a playmaker. Over time, everyone got to know each other's characteristics. At first, the coach was also looking out for me a little, as far as I'm concerned. He knew that my body was not used to this pace.@alperennsengun @HoustonRockets Christian Wood's place in the rotation was guaranteed, he and Daniel Theis were playing double-big, and you were coming from the bench. Where did you position yourself among bigs?@alperennsengun @HoustonRockets Q: During that losing streak, Houston fans also wanted to watch you more. For example, there was an OKC match that you played for five minutes, and Silas was criticized harshly. ++@alperennsengun @HoustonRockets Everyone thinks more of each other now, that was one of the secrets of that seven-game winning streak. We could have won the eighth in the series, but the Milwaukee Bucks were better.@alperennsengun @HoustonRockets We never played with the mentality of ''We are going to lose anyway''. We were very well motivated, we have found a way to play a team game. Everyone was approaching the matches more individually at the beginning of the season then it changed.@alperennsengun @HoustonRockets Sengun: Everything is quickly forgotten here. Everyone is more comfortable. At some point, we all felt bad. We were losing back-to-back, we were all talking about it. if someone else had been in our place, he could have given up completely, but we wanted to win.Omfg. Imma receive my jersey in the off szn. It shouldn‚Äôt take 2-3 months to get a jersey @HoustonRockets https://t.co/i1uU0Uy3vA@alperennsengun @HoustonRockets Q: The Rockets had a very bad start to the season. You have lost in a row, you had one win, you had 16 losses. Rumors were circulating about the future of Coach Silas. What was the mood in the team at that point?@alperennsengun @HoustonRockets Some people I trusted said, "If you play one more year, you can be selected from the top five." But over time, my opinion changed, everything became more clear.@alperennsengun @HoustonRockets Sengun: Absolutely. Glad I came. At that point, I ignored many people, there were people who tried to confuse me. I was undecided at first.@alperennsengun @HoustonRockets Q: In your interview with Socrates last season, you mentioned your desire to be selected in the top ranks and your situation of staying in Europe(to become more experienced) to play basketball for another year to be in the top ranks; but do you say,"I'm glad I chose NBA to play?@alperennsengun @HoustonRockets Of course, let me also point out that I wasn't very good at defense last season, I didn't like that side of the game, to be honest... That's why observers also thought that I was defensively weak before the draft. But they noticed that my defense was also pretty good in Houston.@alperennsengun @HoustonRockets sometimes three on three. I am a bit more of a team player, in team basketball, I can show my skills. So five on five is more convenient for me. Everyone was surprised when I spent the Summer League well with the Rockets jersey.@alperennsengun @HoustonRockets Sengun: Frankly, they expected less from me, they were a bit surprised in the Summer League. There is a situation like this: I spent the last season well, but the training with the teams before the draft is a little different. You play one-on-one, sometimes two-on-two@alperennsengun @HoustonRockets Sengun: I literally took a test in Orlando, a test like an intelligence test. They give me a tablet, something appears on your screen, you have to press the keys with an instant reaction. We were playing a game. But we realized that all this is important for the teams.@alperennsengun @HoustonRockets Q: Sometimes we hear that teams change their preferences as a result of these tests...@alperennsengun @HoustonRockets we looked up the dictionaries, and in the process, the psychologist was observing us. I can say that I have done so much physical training, I have never suffered as much as that psychological test. They said it takes 15 minutes and it took one hour and a half, it was incredible.@alperennsengun @HoustonRockets I took a look at the questions, I swear, not sure if it was 210 or 270 questions, but there were so many questions‚Ä¶ But, you know, their English is also different, they use such strange, difficult words... my translator and I looked at the questions, we tried to understand them@ATTSportsNetSW @HoustonRockets Free Wood &amp; Scoot@alperennsengun @HoustonRockets ≈ûeng√ºn: For example, we practiced in Oklahoma for an hour, and we had a meeting for an hour. There they said, "You will talk to a psychologist for 15-20 minutes''. The psychologist said: "I have prepared questions for you and you will answer them,"@alperennsengun @HoustonRockets Q: You mentioned it, too, but we'd like to open it up a little. Psychological tests, as well as physical tests on young talents before the draft, have become very famous recently. 
What did you encounter on the mental side of the process?@alperennsengun @HoustonRockets Admittedly, it was frustrating to be selected in 16th place, but I came to a great city. I'm very happy in Houston.@alperennsengun @HoustonRockets "OKC will select you, then trade you to Houston," the information came out of nowhere on draft night.
I didn't work out in Houston before the draft night, but my manager kept saying they were calling me.@alperennsengun @HoustonRockets I already thought Oklahoma City Thunder would have chosen me even if other teams hadn't chosen me.
The workouts in Oklahoma were productive. People around me were saying ''Oklahoma would be great for you''. 
For some reason, but my heart wasn't in it.The Rockets take on the 76ers tonight at 5:30pm!

@HoustonRockets | #Rockets https://t.co/m81Pgt1loP@alperennsengun @HoustonRockets I thought pieces of training in Orlando went bad, but even they were very interested.
That's why I was expecting to be chosen by one of the teams I worked out. 
We were getting news on the draft night all the time, we waited and waited, we came at 16th round.@HoustonRockets @ChevronHouston @NBAMathHoops Why don‚Äôt you guys ever have any content ? Like on the road, jet pics nothing.@alperennsengun @HoustonRockets My body was not well. And in those pieces of training, they get everything done, they want to see every detail...
I was at the meetings all the time because they have thought of drafting you earlier. Therefore, I was very tired, both physically and mentally‚Ä¶Houston Rockets were a mess Saturday with Porter leaving arena in middle of the game and Wood reportedly refusing to play in the second half - Rockets' Kevin Porter leaves arena after reportedly having to be restrained from going after coaches https://t.co/HceByk7L6G@alperennsengun @HoustonRockets ≈ûeng√ºn: I had six 'workouts'.

Golden State really f cked up for passing Melo up.

And to be honest, the Houston Rockets don't look too good passing up Giddey, either. https://t.co/JzvlWLUfM1On this day in sports history January 3, Utah Jazz Point Guard John Stockton recorded 26 Points, 24 Assists, and 6 Steals against the Houston Rockets in 1989.Hasn‚Äôt been to a Houston rockets game in Toyota Center https://t.co/e0CywwaPgEThanks very much to the #Rockets fans who participated in tonight's "Let's Talk Houston Rockets" livestream.

ICYMI: https://t.co/u0LbL8Lehe via @YouTube.@adamOsaussies Houston Rockets basically started the copying, and tried to justify it with analytics. Outside of the GSW, teams have always won with a top defense and highly efficient offense. Although, even GSW were pretty good defensively if I remember right.@_LCapitan Every Houston Rocket player except Jalen Green@BleacherReport @ShamsCharania Full story? @HoustonRockets @RocketsPRThe Houston Rockets Trevor Ariza had a fan warm his seat up while he was playing.@bettablastt houston is the only acceptable part of exams bc of the rockets@RationalAdult I went to the Bulls Rockets game in Houston that the Rockets won üòµ‚Äçüí´üò´@andresintheory I live in Houston.
