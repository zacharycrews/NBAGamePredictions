@CBITourney $$$drake@Krisplashed Not the worst thing.If the Nets can't capture the 6 seed the next best thing is 4 the Raptors to.That means we'd travel to Cleveland w Kyrie in tow instead of Toronto w/o him. Bottom line we'd have to play 1 additional game for the 7 seed because we'd put a beatdown on Cleveland.Boy, if all the analysis I watched was from American outlets, I'd be amazed at how small a role the @raptors play in all their impressive victories. 20 minutes of "what's wrong with Philly" while barely mentioning who they played. #wethenorth #Raptors #nba🚨 Line Change 🚨

He had a Championship Team in the Toronto Raptors.

But he decided to leave and be selfish.
He went to the Clippers, has Paul George, and what has he done.
NOTHING!!!!!!

Toronto just beat Philly without VanVleet or Anunoby and the 76ers had Harden and Embiid

#WeTheNorth@Grewal2P @Raptors Obligatory fuck the Refs though cause that was BLATANT favoritism near the end@Raptors LETS GOPascal Siakam tonight vs. PHI:

26 PTS
10 REB
5 AST
10-20 FG

This is his 8th game this season with 25+ PTS, 10+ REB, and 5+ AST.

He has 15 of those games under his belt overall, passing Chris Bosh (14) for the most as a Raptor.

Another big win on the road for Toronto. https://t.co/oB3tOXN2l5Miami, too. And probably Chicago.

The truth remains. No Eastern Conference team wants to run into the Toronto Raptors.@Raptors We Own Philly, LA and other places too 🥷🏽❤️❤️Nicely done tonight @Raptors 👏@Raptors Easy dub boys, Embrick and Soften are measly antsThat’s huge win by the @Raptors we need to improve on our finishing off games better. 4 missed FT this late shouldn’t be happening https://t.co/0WeQqw0F1h@ScottieBurnes @Raptors As a raps fan the pleasure is all oursRight on @Raptors! 
On to the next one!
@Sportsnet @TSN_SportsAs a Toronto sports fan, it's truly the wildest of rides going from inspiring Raptors win to crushing Leafs loss. Cannot wait for the balance-restoring Jays win that gains no ground in an impossible East division.Yassssss!!! Another win for us !!!

#WeTheNorth https://t.co/MC1dB90aZT@sixers had averaged 118 points with Harden and @JoelEmbiid together. Tonight at home they scored 37 points in q1 and lost to the @Raptors without two starters such a long team the boys from the #six , 76ers scored 88 points that’s winning DI can't believe the Toronto Raptors won that game.

What a team effort that was. Precious Achiuwa brought it. Pascal Siakam was his usual All-NBA self.

Big plays from the likes of Armoni Brooks and Chris Boucher, who took an elbow for the win.

This makes you feel good.@Raptors What a game. Good winThe @Raptors just beat the 6ers at home. That’s it, that’s the tweet.@Raptors Toronto owns PhillyOn another note, @Raptors run the east.

STRIKES AGAIN LOL

You can’t make this up. I’m convinced it’s the league against these guys I’m sorry.The @Raptors are getting mugged.@YulBBudy @Raptors Wtf! Late foul again!!!@NBA BS league. NBA officials are the worst. First no foul on Siakam who was raped, then they call a late foul on the Sixers as  the @Raptors were about to tip the ball in. To add insult, now they are reviewing the “foul” call and overturn it for a jump ball. F’n BS.@Raptors @pskills43 Clearly this is Refs 🆚 Raptors. When will this shit EVER end? https://t.co/nLktrrLVd8The officiating has been very one sided tonight, understand Gary’s frustration! #Wethenorth #Raptors #TorontoRaptorsGary Trent Jr. master thief.
