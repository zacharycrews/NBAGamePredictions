 #Brooklyn_Nets@NetsDaily I get why some fans say 12-70. I’m a 12-70 survivor. But Bruce Ratner didn’t care at all about the Nets except how they could serve his real estate interests in Brooklyn. The apathy of that year started w/ him. It was bad but it was transitional.@NBA2K @StephenCurry30 @KDTrey5 @warriors @BrooklynNets Can guys stop resting my settings I’m tried if my shot meter,my jumpshot splash, all my settings in general changing whether it’s joining a new park or when I first log on…Circle 1
