https://t.co/uCbhVj0pqrRant over, but the Dallas fan base has every right to question and be upset with Mark. Rick was a problem and isn't that good of a coach anymore, but he was probably 25% of the problem, the fact is the Mavericks roster stinks and they need to make moves, stop with the feelings.The worst mascot in the league? Fans said the Dallas Mavericks' Mavs Man should be in last place. https://t.co/La3VW2MisNTwo Hampton Roads players battled last night when Brooklyn beat Dallas 102-99. Mavericks forward Dorian Finney-Smith (Norcom), left, had 19 points, 6 rebounds and 2 assists in the loss, while Chesapeake's Cameron Thomas had 6 points and 5 rebounds in the win. https://t.co/AgMSXHCYGcBasketball tweet: It pains me to say this, but the Dallas Mavericks problems are not exclusively on Jason Kidd. That roster... is bad. Their front office did a bad job, and put Jason Kidd in a position to avoid accountability for being a bad coach.  Shame on them.@domandrews123 @dallasmavs Stop hating@MavsFilmRoom That's my whole problem with the offense. If the 3's aren't falling, why do we keep taking them??????
At the beginning of that clip, @dallasmavs had 86 points. They only ended up with a total of 99. Why not take higher percentage shots (closer to the rim)?@mcuban One question I have been dying to know for years as a Mavs fan is if the red fry in the @Whataburger timeout competition to win free Whataburger for year, is at all different from the others used between the two people competing to throw the coveted red fry? @dallasmavsholding all four opponents to 91 points or fewer.  One of those games was against the Dallas Mavericks on Saturday when they won 97-90 for just 187 combined points.

Nope. The Mavs did when they beat him (when he was a higher seed, no less).I can't believe the Dallas Mavericks shot 9-46 (19.6%) from 3 tonight@dallasmavs @Chime It’s basketball and we can’t shoot the ball 🤷‍♂️✨Kevin Durant scored 24 points, James Harden had 23 points and 12 assists, and the Brooklyn Nets beat Dallas 102-99 on Tuesday night, handing the Mavericks their fifth consecutive home loss.

All we did was resign Hardaway and get Bullock who have both been terrible@mavsncowboys @Starr_Rx @dallasmavs @Chime Big who mans the paint and get a decent guard back who may not be as good as brunson but is good enough i would do it and im a guy who says brunson is arguably our 2nd best most consistent player.“I’m into having shit turning dreams to average shit/Bringing your trophy to the club Dallas Mavericks shit”

All trash.My Tennessee Vols and Dallas Mavericks combined to shoot 15-86 from 3 tonight. Some stormtrooper level shit right there@dallasmavs @Chime Y'all just flat out suck! J.Kidd was a train wreck of a hire! Trade KP, and the coaching staff for fresh towels and Gatorade@dallasmavs @Chime At this point its not even losing...

That's pretty embarrassing for you.@SportsCenter Also helps the @dallasmavs are a garbage team right now.@mavsncowboys @dallasmavs @Chime Quite frankly as someone who has a page on the Mavs website for my wedding, I'd rather text than look at Dwight Powell too@mrobbins1016 @dallasmavs @Chime And now it’s poorly coached too so may not even make it to the first@dallasmavs @Chime Wasn’t surprised, but it still hurt. 😑@dallasmavs @Chime 9-46 for three@dallasmavs @Chime A combined 0-13 from 3, from the guys we pay to shoot 3s 😭😭😭😭😭😭 https://t.co/h6N8IqMwnk@GDB_LPN @oscaaargalla @rubenfaz214 @dallasmavs @Chime Congrats, KD is a monster. Mavs shot 9-46 from three lol, if they shot 25% (which is still garbage) they would have won this game.@dallasmavs  trade @jalenbrunson1The way Charles is whining coming back on @NBAonTNT I think he did more than just predict the @dallasmavs would winy’all tired of losing yet? @dallasmavsBlow it up @dallasmavs@manny__xo @dallasmavs That call was REVERSED.

Change is needed a person with impaired vision can see that...#next #bad@AndresFCBi @dallasmavs @Chime Still shooting 3s 3% &gt; Doncic.@dallasmavs Jason Kidd is Mavs' Jason Garrett. Awful coach. Just a yes man to the owner. More talent than any team yet worst offense I've seen in 10 years. @luka7doncic  is a whining baby that can't shoot free throws or 3's yet he gets to run the team. Will be bad for a long time@dallasmavs @Chime How tf do you go 9-46 from 3??!!!@YoungWood609 @dallasmavs Yeahh i know they are the stars, but hardaway needs to step up if they cant score. He must prove that he deserves all of the money that mavs pay him at the off season@dallasmavs @Chime Luka is playing alone trade KP and finney smith for a players can help LukaFINAL:

Mavs have now lost 8 of their last 10 games.I like the DALLAS on these Mavericks uniforms, with the cowboy hat behind the D, but it feels like the font size is too small.@RLopez04193767 @dallasmavs In the NBA hand is apart of the ballHey @dallasmavs I am pretty sure I can hit some of these open 3’s for ya for a lot cheaper.@dallasmavs how do you guys stand hardaway. rooting for you guys but TH just fkx everything up.

Refs favoring Harden again. That was a foul. You can't grab someone's wrist even after you get ball. Doncic wasn't able to regain ball because of hold.@dallasmavs Hardaway sucksPorzingas used to EAT on the Knicks he just been subpar on The Mavs smh #DallasMavericks@AustinPlanet @NBA @BrooklynNets @dallasmavs Only reason it happens cause it’s Luka. Refs are too obvious in their bias against him. It’s stupid.The Dallas Mavericks make me sickHaving to spend another year watching the @dallasmavs have horrible 3 point shooters around Luka &amp; KP because @mcuban won’t listen to “Mavs Twitter” https://t.co/gHiLjbu0Vc@dallasmavs this is hard to watch for 82 games a year. Something has to give.@dallasmavs FU super loosers@mcuban Is @tonyromo name on the basketball court as well since he played for the @dallasmavs?@NBA @BrooklynNets @dallasmavs Goat@dallasmavs   And why again did we get rid of James Johnson for pretty much nothing?  Sure would like to have him back tonight.@NBA @dallasmavs Luka Doncic you are a wonderful player and a strong leader so stop messing with the referees - 🤩 keep the team focused.Don’t really understand these last two foul calls in the @dallasmavs game. Harden clearly fouled Luka… but whatever we will go fuck ourselvesWatching the @dallasmavs play the @BrooklynNets in Dallas where their respective coaches spent time during their playing careers.

I guess it could backfire, but I believe in both offenses long-term.@NBA @dallasmavs Nets be flopping lmaoHarden has 12 points on 64 TS% and 50 FG%, 8 assists to 3 turnovers, more points than the KD, but for you 100% the reason the Brooklyn Nets can’t beat the 500. Dallas Mavericks.

@dallasmavs lead in Q2 on TNT! https://t.co/FOPO23W38DHALF: Nets 50, Mavericks 62

LaMarcus Aldridge (13 PTS), James Johnson (10 PTS, 5 REBS) &amp; the Nets are shooting well at 51%. However, they’re getting exposed in the interior defensively. A lack of pressure overall on that end is making Dallas a little bit too comfortable.@leehuiling98 @NBA @dallasmavs Dm this ratioDALLAS MAVERICKS 22 NBA CITY EDITION '47 CLEAN UP

@T_HardJR | @dallasmavs https://t.co/AjrB6fODGuIt took me 14-minutes to notice this...

...which makes me think I'm losing my focus.

Or maybe it was the Brooklyn Nets vs. the Dallas Mavericks game?@dallasmavs I’m loving the unis!!@dallasmavs @AcmeBrick That nearly blew my speakers lol@SporTV Dallas Mavericks@dallasmavs Give and go,great@arinettamb @dallasmavs lol doing good so far lol@dallasmavs @AcmeBrick That’s hot@dallasmavs @luka7doncic Carried the ball.Dallas #Mavericks looking good. Luka &amp; the #Knicks old timers. Definitely getting a contribution from Porzingis, Hardaway Jr., Bullock &amp; Ntilikina.The Mavericks lead the Nets 52-44 with 2:10 left in the 2nd Quarter. Doncic with 10 on 4-8 for Dallas. Aldridge with 11 on 5-8 to pace Brooklyn.Mavericks lead the Nets 52-44 with 2:10 to play in the first half. 

Feels like Brooklyn should be down way more. Dallas is destroying them inside. They haven't turned it over once. James Johnson is the only one who looks like he wants to be on the court right now.Run that back 〽️🦄
