Round 1. Game 1. 
Let's go @chicagobullsIf there is a game Chicago can get. It will be today. So, the Bucks are gonna get the Bulls best shot. Won’t be a cakewalk.

They at leats have my support this year. I’d like to see them win a chipgame time !!! 🔥🔥 #seered @chicagobulls@chicagobulls dont care tatum just dropped 31Bulls +10.5 (1U)

This number seems a bit inflated due to the bulls recent skid. This is a banged up team that’s had time to get healthy with the 5 day stretch of no games. The Bucks have struggled to cover the # this year sitting at 39-43 ATS, which is I like Chicago within 10.@chicagobulls @betwayusa Oh we can get fancy too! It’s not all about @Giannis_An34MILWAUKEE BUCKS (3) vs CHICAGO BULLS (6)

GAME 1:

🍌BULLS +10.5 https://t.co/PFcebBteF6@chicagobulls @calamos Scary hours! Let’s gooo #BullsNation@jakerich69 @Dodgers @Heandog8 Dude be sucking on a lollipop. Bulls suck. Bears suck. Chicago sucks. How u liking Freeman now?@chicagobulls They gonna be really disappointed today@chicagobulls UC north lmao@chicagobulls Bucks in 6 unfortunately@chicagobulls Just don’t lose by 30 man and I’ll be chillingThey now find themselves matched up with the defending champion Milwaukee Bucks and Finals MVP Giannis Antetokounmpo, who trampled the Bulls in all four matchups this season. Will the Bucks championship pedigree prove too mighty? Or will the Bulls show some of that Chicago fight?If the @chicagobulls can just stay in this game to the end 
Would be a great victory.

The defending champs take on the sliding Bulls, hampered without Lonzo Ball. The Bulls lack an answer for Giannis or3-pt. shooting to keep up with their offense. A healthy Brook Lopez helps the Bucks greatly

@patricklw4 | #SeeRed https://t.co/OkZJDOK36dGood afternoon everyone (Except to Kevin Durant who is selling again)!🍺

Here’s my SGP for Bulls v Bucks! I like DeRozan and LaVine to carry the scoring load for Chicago. Caruso had 6 &amp; 8 assists the last 2 games against MIL and Vucevic gets abused in this matchup. Giannis.🤘 https://t.co/0qgSseous3💰Bucks -3.5 in 1st Quarter vs Chicago
-Bucks 42-33-1 ATS in 1st quarter (6th best)
-Bulls 33-44 ATS in 1Q (5th worst)
-Bucks 22-16 ATS 1Q at home (5th best)
-Bulls 17-23 ATS 1Q on the road (10th worst)
-Bucks have covered 3 of 4 matchups vs CHI this year https://t.co/JRDpPJYBBnThe Chicago Bulls (+10.5) are up against the Milwaukee Bucks (-10.5) at 6:30 PM EDT today.

58% of Shark Pick users are taking CHI (+10.5, -110) and 42% are taking MIL (-10.5, -110).

Who do you like?@Bulls_Peck @chicagobulls @2Xtremebounce Well, I wish them the best...... BUT with my mind I bet the Bucks HARD tonight🔴𝐋𝐢𝐯𝐞 𝐋𝐢𝐧𝐤 𝐎𝐧📺

5:42 - 7:45 Watch the Bucks absolutely obliterate the Chicago Bulls@Stacey21King @chicagobulls got to stay attached to the @Bucks  to have a chance in this series. Can't get behind by 15 or more then having to play uphill. But I really believe Zach is going to play well. Make Vooch play in the post; he shouldn't come out of the paint.If the Bulls win this series, I’ll shave my entire beard.

Yup. Yup. Pretty sure that definitely happened. People literally just say shit to say it. 😂I have an idea for a Rudy Gobert to the Bulls trade, just hear me out.

Vucevic, White, (Bradley?), multiple 1sts for Gobert, maybe a sign and trade with Paschall. 

Chicago's 1st next year is protected but WILL go to Orlando. After that, they have a protected 1st to the Spurs..Game 1 today! 😤😤😤 @chicagobullsI really want the @chicagobulls to prove me wrong 😭😭🏀NBA Playoffs 2022 Live 🏀

I have zero expectations, all I can pray for is that they give the Bucks a series like they used to give to Boston…

6th seed was my hope, and they got it. But man it looked SO good early on. Step forward, but next year will be big.@i_bigelow @chicagobulls I'm down. Shock the world.For the first time since April 28th, 2017, the Chicago Bulls will appear in a playoff game. 

The series outlook may not be the best, and the end of the regular season may have been rough. But today's a sign of real organizational progress.Miami Heat - Atlanta Hawks
Milwaukee Bucks - Chicago Bulls

You can do it if you only have to worry about Middleton but when you add jrue good luck.@MaIakiBranham @chicagobulls Cleveland is poverty 😂🤣"As long as that passion’s still there, you can continue to get better.”

DeMar DeRozan just keeps getting better. After a career year with the Chicago Bulls, tonight will be a test of his postseason staying power against the Bucks. https://t.co/LGnZ9lVWf2There is a @chicagobulls playoff game today!!!

Limiting buckets from beyond the arc could be Milwaukee’s toughest challenge, but they’ve got a strategy in hand that’s haunted the Bulls before:https://t.co/HFjVVWTzWl🇺🇸 NBA Playoffs,

Chicago Bulls +550 vs Milwaukee Bucks $100,000

Bulls are a power house team have more titles than any other franchise in the past 30 years. Bucks are likely worn out from their past playoff experience. Bulls were also ranked #1 in East in Mid October

#basketball@chicagobulls @SendMeThisVideo please.@chicagobulls @ZachLaVine @DeMar_DeRozan So sad. 1st round exit@chicagobulls Ratio@ShamsCharania @chicagobulls Nets betterNBA playoff schedule is so dumb. Bulls first game is Sunday and the next is on Wednesday. Even if they were traveling in between those games they’d be going an hour and a half south from Milwaukee from Chicago. Tf do these guys need 2 days off for?Check out this listing I just added to my #Poshmark closet: Jordan Chicago bulls vintage true fan jersey shirt 1980s early 1990s mens large. https://t.co/hcJmI9QoDl #shopmycloset @poshmarkappColumn ... by Paul Sullivan: DeMar DeRozan carried the #Chicago Bulls all season long. Can he do it again in the #NBAPlayoffs?

There. Fixed it for youZach LaVine soaks in his 1st playoff berth in his 8th NBA season. ‘It’s about time,’ the Chicago Bulls guard says. https://t.co/dSdEHtHkz8@jake_N49 @chicagobulls I will make the sixers loss in the first round don’t test me@snnonyeka Oya tell me you’re supporting Jordan and the Chicago Bulls and you’re supporting them to win the title this season 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣@kylebutonline @chicagobulls rare LJustin Fields goes to Blackhawks games

Justin Fields goes to Bulls games

Justin Fields goes to Cubs games

Justin Fields goes to White Sox games

Anything the national media says is unbaked nonsense! Fields seems to love Chicago. imo, he WILL be a #Bears legend!!!@chicagobulls @ZachLaVine @DeMar_DeRozan Caruso better not get in foul trouble early and bulls need to play Def!@DavidGCasas Chicago Bulls!Check out 2021-22 Panini Sticker &amp; Card Collection Chicago Bulls Logo Cracked Ice #157 https://t.co/iegnXswQBY @eBay@tabbythegirl Watch the Chicago Bulls play the Milwaukee Bucks and eat dinner with family@satavvibes @BoJackPick6 @chicagobulls @ZachLaVine @DeMar_DeRozan TNT is fire tho@chicagobulls @ZachLaVine @DeMar_DeRozan How was that 2 min flight?@chicagobulls you’re sponsor ain’t showing no care for your fans #23Forever【Stock information】CHICAGO BULLS TEE / RED / https://t.co/iqm5IEjU1p@EGuz27 @chicagobulls Yessir 💪🏿Column: Can DeMar DeRozan carry Chicago Bulls again? https://t.co/PKdesUuYao@BleacherReport Chicago Bulls@chicagobulls @ZachLaVine Welcome to the playoffs, Professor Zach. ❤️‍🔥 https://t.co/KxZlrqorshThe real playoff doesn’t start till tomorrow when the @chicagobulls start playing. #SeeRed #BullsNationThe National Sports Daily, April 17, 1990 #Jumpman #JumpmanHistory #AirJordan #MichaelJordan #Jordan #Chicago #Bulls #NBA #NationalSportsDaily https://t.co/54HxaFm9VF@EmpTigerstar I once saw someone complain that, for a series canonically about teenagers in the 1990s, the Harry Potter series of books unrealistically NEVER has any character mention Michael Jordan or his glory years with the Chicago Bulls.  

This kerfuffle is only slightly less silly.@Khieran10 @chicagobulls Ending up with 6 championships and a perfect finals record, with far more accolades in less years played I’d imagine@chicagobulls arriving in Milwaukee to fk shit up! #BullsNation https://t.co/J6xlN9kvGnI'm going to do an NBA bet. If the Milwaukee Bucks sweep the Chicago Bulls, I will rename myself to Deer Man until the Bucks get eliminated from the playoffs. Luckily, this is a safe bet since it's unlikely the Bulls will get swept by the Bucks! #GoBulls@MichelleObama @chicagobulls @girlsalliance @MBK_Alliance @ObamaFoundation Well they have a good tutor 🙏~@jivijil @Vikings @VeKingsNFT @NFL @vechainofficial No haha. Just a bunch of Ethereum projects in a Collab right now with Chicago bulls. So I'm manifesting a Veking/Vikings Collab one day 😂The Chicago Bulls play playoff basketball tomorrow and I'm not nearly as excited as I should be, the team really killed my excitement these last few months@chicagobulls I watch the bulls Timberwolves vs. the Grillsile game and I am inspired. The bulls can win a game have a chance. These top seeded teams are running out of gas not to mention the pressure. My bulls are playing with that house money and that's good!!!@carnageclaps @chicagobulls @ZachLaVine @DeMar_DeRozan Nah not on the weekend especially nba playoffs weekend 😅@GraysonA_Goat @jk5987 @chicagobulls @DeMar_DeRozan @ZachLaVine Makes sense https://t.co/vPTUNJLKBKI would like to see Embiid playing in Chicago.
