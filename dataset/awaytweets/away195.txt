Bulls didn’t even get one easy bucket in that game they played against dubs . They couldn’t even break 100, derozan failed to score field goals so Much he started drawing fouls . And Lavine’s shots were either step backs or tough shots@Flam3_13 @BrooklynNets if james harden has another good game, i think we can do it.

The Brooklyn Nets forward will serve as the co-CEO of Infinite Acquisition Corp. @KDTrey5 A true Magnate‼️@LegionHoops 1st round playoff exit to the Atlanta Hawks or Brooklyn Nets…. GUARANTEED (chuck voice) 🤣🤣🤣Teams with 9+ wins this season:

Golden State Warriors
Washington Wizards
Brooklyn Nets https://t.co/zS9DDcHG6Q@KingJamesStory @BrooklynNets No capThe Washington Wizards are 9-3

No other team in the entire NBA has 9 wins. 

Golden State Warriors and Brooklyn Nets are Mickey Mouse team

The Wizards haven’t even had Rui Hachimura or Thomas Bryant for one game this season. 

Kyle Kuzma is the best player in the world. https://t.co/EkBEwexn4H@Kyriehlights @za_hmm @PlayboiClaxton @SociosHoops @BrooklynNets @warriors I don’t think you’re Kyrie Irving…@HoopAnalysisNet @ScoopB @kylekuzma @SDinwiddie_25 Oh please. As a Brooklyn resident and Brooklyn Net fan I'm a Dinwiddie fan&amp; I can tell you that Spencer made a huge contribution to the Nets both as a player&amp; recruiter. I would also submit that he talks a lot maybe to much and presenting Kuzma as an elite stretch 4 is comical.The Brooklyn Nets are 44-14 when James Harden plays since the trade

Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving have each played in 33 of those games

All 3 have played 13 games together@PlayboiClaxton @SociosHoops @BrooklynNets @warriors My girl and she doesn’t have Twitter@NBA @BrooklynNets The tankI’m outside next weekend might treat myself to a nets game in BrooklynUpdated Post: PUNK NBA La Lakers , Miami Warmth , Golden State , Brooklyn Nets , Milwaukee Bucks… https://t.co/h8Hst3BHhw https://t.co/HSve28qHWh@ProllyNotIsaak @j82402369 @BrooklynNets He had to face the superteam warriors every year@JFloyd314 @BillyBrew @LawyerCat_ @BadLegalTakes Either you're confidently incorrect, or I am. I'm pretty sure Brooklyn Nets NBA basketball player Kyrie Irving plays basketball.@BrooklynNets Resorts World Catskill Mountain Casino! Go Nets! https://t.co/0kSLlO0NsC@ocxg1958 @YallLuvCris That may be but the Brooklyn Nets are as old as the Lakers but nobody is talking about how old the Nets are.@statmuse @JHarden13 @BrooklynNets He still has it I guess@BrooklynNets Trade Kyrie for Ingram, trust me.So far this season, only KD &amp; Jokić are averaging 20+ ppg on at least 55% shooting
