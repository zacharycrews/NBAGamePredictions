Washington Wizards roster has multiple teammates that can be on the ball decision makers, that’s improvement just with the players themselves.Weirdest sports team name I’ve ever seen. Should never have been allowed haha

They eventually became the Washington Wizards oddly enough https://t.co/9o7U8pHYDe@dcsportsMYVIEW @tdubinyoface @NBAwizardry Washington Wizards franchise player is holding the team back right now.
His poor 3-point shooting has hurt the team.  Washington Wizards win 3 extra games with the USUAL BRADLEY BEAL.How will Rui Hachimura figure into the Washington Wizards' rotation once he's ready to play? What about Thomas Bryant? 

The #Wizards' biggest strength should be their depth, but they haven't had their full complement of players yet. Urgency is increasing.
