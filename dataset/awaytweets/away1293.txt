There is not way comparing things how 2K handle things for the players we create,Tatum should have better ball handling and better driving layups since he is smaller and less weight.

I know Celtics are guilty of it as well, but that's what it's called.  Allen saw Williams there, saw the shoulder coming and just took it to draw a foul.  Was it a foul? Yeah, probably.  But less so that Giannis running people over in the paint.DO OR DIE TONIGHT @celtics legacies on the line.

He should have a high ball security, which is why they need to bring that rating back. 87 ball handle is crqzy for a guy who rarely does any advanced dribbling type of moves. It's high because he doesn't get stripped, which is overkillHey #NFTCommunity we have our second matchup of the night!

The only thing I can think of to justify it is that ball handling also determines steal success rate and Giannis dont get stripped often@NBA2K @Bucks @celtics and this is why i dont and wont play this game anymore😂@steveniscool125 @xado124 @GuessWhoNot_DJT @ajbennett23 @NBA2K @Bucks @celtics That’s not what he’s saying at all he’s saying when he brings the ball up it gets stripped less what your talking about is passing a ball and it going out of bounds.

Giannis is less turnover prone and averages more assists than tatum. And dont start with that doesnt have to do anything with ball handle.Live NBA

Steph and Trae try to do the same thing and it results in a turnover WAY more often. That's why they're lower.@GuessWhoNot_DJT @ajbennett23 @NBA2K @Bucks @celtics it's 2k... ball handle means how well someone is able to dribble in game. idk why you can't understand that 😭@celtics need to foul giannis in mid air like he did to Tatum last game !@Dennis_Andrade_ @NestPgs @celtics @NBA @Bucks Daddy Tatum is shitting on those frauds later https://t.co/R9uUICJdVg@NBA2K @Bucks @celtics Ball handle look kinda off 😂😂@Thegoat93433133 @GuessWhoNot_DJT @ajbennett23 @NBA2K @Bucks @celtics how did this reply to a 2k tweet get so heated 😭@steveniscool125 @ajbennett23 @NBA2K @Bucks @celtics If "ball handle" was all about how crafty your handle is, and not how effective it is, someone like Trae Young would have a 99 ball handle instead of a 93.Predicted @NBA Playoffs 5/9/2022:

That was a great time to be a Boston Celtics fan.Biggest game of the year tonight @celtics@GuessWhoNot_DJT @C1ampy @NBA2K @Bucks @celtics It is quite literally just how crafty your handle is in 2K@NBA2K @Bucks @celtics Add celebrities back on black top, and add my boy Jamal Crawford to the game. How y’all got all time clippers but he not on the team@ehis_jr @TyphoonPapii @NBA2K @Bucks @celtics cause ratings can be crazy asf. There was a year where Chris Paul had an 86 ball handle and Giannis had an 87. For starters, Giannis is rarely doing anything fancy in terms of dribbling to have an 87, need to bring back security rating, 2nd it's Chris Paul for crying out loud@bleedgreenbnr18 @IsoGodCisco @Nobodyaskedxd @NBA @Bucks @celtics You mean when he was flopping from “taking charges” if you’re just going to stand there and now play defense your probably going to get hurt@steveniscool125 @GuessWhoNot_DJT @ajbennett23 @NBA2K @Bucks @celtics Giannis clears Tatum Srry@coreyreilly00 @celtics @Bucks @NBAonTNT @985TheSportsHub @jaytatum0 Giannis doesn’t need a jump shot@celtics @Bucks @NBAonTNT @985TheSportsHub Good luck.

That sh*t doesn't make you much better of a basketball player. It's about how effective you are with the ball in your hands. How smart are you with where to put the ball against your opponent.@celtics @Bucks @NBAonTNT @985TheSportsHub Can’t wait. High energy coast to coast for 48 minutes.

It's what you do when you're down that defines you. As Barkley said: Anyone can hit a shot when you're up or tied in a game. Making a last second shot when your down by one or more points is something else. MJ could do it. Need JT to do the same.NBA BASKETBALL IS TONIGHT! #NBAPlayoffs #NBA75

Celtics being down 2-1 is different@NBA2K @Bucks @celtics It's actually pretty funny how people are failing to realize that "ball control" has less to do with how crafty your handles are, but rather how efficient you are at creating a bucket when the ball is in your hands.@C1ampy @NBA2K @Bucks @celtics That one's more difficult to measure because Dame averages a lot of assists. But I can see it.@WisemanFan @NBA2K @Bucks @celtics U lost ur mind, Wiggins a chris bosh lvl player gianiss n Tatum legit 1s@NBA2K @Bucks @celtics Cmon now. Giannis all day.

We need a different defensive look for Giannis, nothing will completely stop him but it may at least slow him down and force his hand. Also more cuts to the basket #NBAPlayoffs #BOSvsMIL #NBA@goldorayo boston celtics@celtics we need to win tonight or this shit over@celtics Celtics play half as good.. since Jan 25 less 1 good game in Brooklyn- you win by double digits despite playing 5 vs 8th.

These next few days gonna be so funny. The realisation your team sucks dick gonna hit HARD in Boston... 😍🤣🤣#NBA POTD 🏀

1.5u: Boston Celtics +1 (-110)

I think this is the time in the series where the loss of Khris Middleton starts showing. 

Celtics are 21-11 on ML following a loss and 8-1 in L9. I’m backing motivation to tie the series 2-2 going back home.

You always reap what you sow.Hey @bos_celtics_pr @celticsblog @BostonGlobe @BostonDotCom @BillSimmons @Celtics he has a point. #FreeEnesFreedom please please please please suit him up against Giannis.
@NBA https://t.co/HiFPbrG1EH@spidahdoteth @BrotherAndrej @celtics He’s basically trapping his own arm in grant while he’s trying to make a play to get away from him. It makes no sense. In no way is that dirty. Where as that giannis rip of the arm was completely unnecessary as grant was harmlessly wrapping him up so he couldn’t get a shot up@spidahdoteth @BrotherAndrej @celtics Bro you must be on the wind up🤣🤣😭 look where connaughton sticks his arm to reach the ball. I don’t know about you but I don’t remember many times, if any, where a defender reaches through the body rather than around to get to the ball. G is trying to get him off him because…@duggsdoes123 @JasonDRobins @Bucks @celtics Who invested in ath? Im in at $19@KAMMY__99 @BrotherAndrej @celtics You need to prove this is happening. I’ve yet to see Giannis run full speed into someone without it being called on him. Ive asked multiple people to show an example of this and NO ONE can.@spidahdoteth @BrotherAndrej @celtics Well if u can’t find anything then maybe pay attention to the games then because it happens on several occasions. There’s being stronger than someone and then there’s extending your arm or just straight up running full speed into people. Stop denying it. The evidence is therePlease dawg please @celticsGuys pray to allah that boston celtics win even if ur atheist ples😞all the playoff series are 2-2 please don’t embarrass me tomorrow @celticsHuh, another time that the media narrative doesn’t match reality @Bucks @celtics https://t.co/9AlKFTl1OIThank you Brady Walker for your time and efforts with the Boston Celtics!@FambroughAdv @chicagobulls @Lakers @celtics Thank you so much my friend@KAMMY__99 @BrotherAndrej @celtics This was way worse and more dangerous. https://t.co/TVJ6bYvegZNBA PLAYOFFS SCHEDULE (Monday, May 9th)

9 pm GM 4 Memphis Grizzlies @ Golden State Warriors TNT

#NBAPlayoffsGood night, everyone! Friendly reminder that Jayson Tatum and the Boston Celtics will be back tomorrow and beyond that! 

Btw, Jayson Tatum runs the NBA!I find it funny that @celtics fans are complaining about physical play, when their entire game plan has been to foul @Giannis_An34 on every possession to keep him out of rhythm and out of the lane. @Bucks #NBAPlayoffs #soft@KAMMY__99 @BrotherAndrej @celtics There is nothing showing what you are saying is happening when I search. Just a bunch of Celtics flopping and whining.@Billrusso17 @Corey66376426 @celtics I didn't know that's how they decided awards.@CBrownSportsArt @chicagobulls @Lakers @celtics This is awesome!@tdgarden @G_Eazy @gucci1017 @celtics @KeyshiaKaoir Love the garden. https://t.co/ktByFiufHg@Billrusso17 @Corey66376426 @celtics No, you didn't.@spidahdoteth @BrotherAndrej @celtics I don’t need to show you an example of something that happens so often. Go look yourself. Type in “giannis refs” and you’ll find plenty of clips of him illegally barraging into people. maybe it’ll hit home how ridiculous it is that one of the best players can get away with thatPlease make the series 2-2 tomorrow @celtics. If Philly and Dallas can tie it down 2-0 there’s no excusewin tomorrow please @celtics@1GR8FULGUY @FlaPanthers @warriors @MiamiHEAT @celtics Oh yeah!!!!!! $50@celtics Could really use his shooting, damn it@jrdpj9991 @celtics Jason tatbum day is 4-19Time for us to tie this series tomorrow and win in 6! @celticsgotta keep the 2-2 series trend going @celtics@oeltap @Cam_Lopez8 @NPuntIntendedSP @ByJayKing @celtics Kind of understand why they're all so deluded and play this victim card all the time when their entire roster falls over off any time a gust of wind breezes past.
Flailing their arms about and complaining to the refs, that shit has become contagious within the fanbase.@KAMMY__99 @BrotherAndrej @celtics Can you grab a few examples of this? I don’t see it. Committing murder huh?

On the other note, Grant did the exactly same thing to Pat C the game before.Ight I need y’all to tie this shit up tomorrow and stop fucking around!! @celtics  🍀🍀@_anthonynash Iono. What y’all think? @celticsHandle business tomorrow @celtics@celtics @jaytatum0 PLEASE DONT DISGRACE ME TOMORROW@spidahdoteth @BrotherAndrej @celtics By illegally running into people literally half of the time he goes into the paint. Apparently cos the defenders aren’t set, it means it’s ok to commit a murder in the paint. Oh and he’s a dirty mfer aswell. Nearly ripped grant’s arm off. Dirty like Allen and portis🤮Mavs and 76ers tied their series at 2-2.

I’ve been watching the Boston Celtics games with the sound on my cellphone cut off to try and get any fan interaction out of the game hoping the players can concentrate. Good luck 🍀😉💯.

Bucks did what they were supposed to do but go sell your BS somewhere else if you’re seeking respect as champs@celtics Playoffs Al 💪🏻🇩🇴🔥@TooGrrey @celtics Tell your team to actually use skill instead of running people over, maybe less flopping will have to happen just to get a damn foul called@Adam_Mansfield_ @BrianTRobb @NBA @Bucks @celtics Hmm 3 Calls Went In Favor Of Boston Ina Last Two Mins But Cry Some More Lmao@smart_MS3 @celtics cmon y’all
Green blood from #Sacramento needs to ✈️ to TD to see you in the finals 🏆💚☘️🙌
#Celtics https://t.co/tRuN8VVkyM@celtics Bucks have little skill, so their approach is just physicality. Giannis is frustrated b/c his BS game is getting stopped by Al, rest is garbage pts, or just running people over. I think Gm 4 is BOS, just NBA can stretch this to 7. If only @NBAOfficial actually called Giannis’s BS@TooGrrey @celtics All the Celtics do is flop and fall down what a pathetic D why don’t t you man up and actually play a guy but you can’t cause your to small to guard Giannis so let’s flop and fall to the ground what a clown show 🤡@celtics would never do this to you. https://t.co/67r9ianTfr@celtics There are no adjustments vs the Greek Freak the most dominant force in Basketball 🏀 🤷🏻‍♂️@TooGrrey @celtics Wrong team you are accusing of flopping@NBCSCeltics @NBCSBoston Boston Celtics Do ur JOB 💯💯💯👌🏾👀💚☘ https://t.co/OQ3v5jJaN8@DanKelley66 @NBAOfficial @celtics @Bucks @smart_MS3 Yes and it's not pretty@celtics Shit@BarryMather3 @Cam_Lopez8 @NPuntIntendedSP @ByJayKing @celtics fans don’t know the difference between good defense and flopping.@veryrare_ns @stylevish1 @celtics Yes god he dooo but we know he finna at least drop 25-28 maybe even 30 👀@celtics Dear Udoka,use intermittent zone defense against the Greek gorilla.If there’s one team that’s proven they can overcome adversity, it’s the Boston Celtics 🤷‍♂️@MattConover6 @NBA @celtics @Bucks Totally agree @MattConover6. All of it has gotten out of control. The flopping, the carrying, the traveling, the exaggerated movements from anyone with the ball when someone is close, and the effort that is made to protect high profile players by the officiating crews. #all4showNBA36 PROJECT Eastern Conference Semi G4 - Milwaukee Bucks @ Boston Celtics: Giannis Antetokounmpo scored 40 pts and grabbed 18 rebounds as the Bucks rolled past the Celtics 108-82 to take a 3-1 series lead.

#GamblingTwiitter 
#nbabets@ASherrodblakely @FCHWPO @celtics @Bucks Jaylen is in the right mindset coz the result can't change. Problem is officials shouldnt encourage flopping. Plus maintaining that Smart was not in the act of shooting, conflicts with fan and media perspectives. Bad officiating is no different than a player having a bad game.Hope my @Celtics watchin film.The Boston Celtics need a repeat performance from Derrick White 
(along with a few other things) to be successful in Game 4 👀 #Celtics

Also: those two (2) shades of green don't even match! https://t.co/xnxjgObGBO@justinsuperbuck Sad that the @celtics make flopping part of their defense. Does appear to be effecting the refs.The Milwaukee Bucks survived a late rally from the Boston Celtics to grab a 2-1 Eastern Conference semifinals lead, 103-101, while the Golden State Warriors bounced back from a disappointing Game 2 loss and demolished the Memphis Grizzlies, 142-112

Too many fast breaks last game where he took it all the way on a 2-on-1. And his last drive was a great half spin fake until he got to the paint and didn't kick out. Trust your teammates man.@HoopDames @HPbasketball @celtics @Bucks @sixers Milwaukee is defending champion and their seeding doesn't reflect that they're the toughest out in the whole playoffs, imo@Bossston617 @celtics Go for it !@celtics Paint Posture Pivot Prop Pick  Poise Points@leftfloater Ratio + all time defender, elite shooter, more rings in the last 10 years than Boston Celtics.@AdamHimmelsbach Look at the replay and tell me Bobby Portis didn't foul Marcus Smart after the missed free throw?
