It is what it is.  My personal perceptions:

1) The officials have made more bad / no calls against the Celtics

2) #1 is not why the Celtics are behind - they have sucked.

3) On paper, the C's are better.  They need to play like it.@warriors @StephenCurry30 He’s gonna have 14 in the game if he’s shooting like this before.@warriors @StephenCurry30 I love this warmup routine. I can already see Curry and the warriors hold up that beautiful trophy.@warriors @StephenCurry30 Let’s go warriors let’s get this win 🏆45 mins to tip ball. @warriors have to start well tonight to stand a chance.

TUNE U OUT😇😇😇@NBA @warriors Now, it's opposite, his father is wholeheartedly coming in games and showing love and emotion as well as his family members and his brother. Curry is a dominant player plus inevitable, better make a plan before he drops shot.Couple thoughts on this: 

1) He gon rap from both the Warriors and Celtics POV? 

2) Congrats to the 2022 NBA Champion Golden State Warriors https://t.co/uuFBOXVUsV@Boards2Buckets @celtics @warriors @nbatopshot @Onthebreakpod @M2Jimbo @Stats_2_Cash @Flash2CashTS @TopShotCares @DriverzNFT @ChewieWoolf @cptcnote11 @pdhooms @packdrip Watching on twitch @DreamShake_R ?@warriors END IT@Richard64503704 @NBAMuse24 @Money23Green @Draymond23Muse @warriors @WarriorsMuse @GoIdenState @OnBallSteph @ramon_rican @RanDumNBA @SplashBrosMuse @Jumpman23 Bron was never robbed of a DPOY.

Bleed Green and Go Blue!!!!!!!!!! #allfor18 #NBAFinals@AllThingsBall23 @NotBlizzzo @warriors He’s smart and rightAs Game 6 of the #NBAFinals tips off tonight, the @warriors could claim their seventh title in franchise history. 

Over in Thrive City, members of #DubNation are confident that the W's have what it takes to bring San Francisco its first chip. 
https://t.co/QTdXKnAEOEIts ludicrous that KD's rings from @warriors team is an argument to solidify his greatness because he won MVP. KD had it easy because of Curry getting doubled. Im sure @KDTrey5 knows that. Wigs dominated Game 5 with Steph on floor. At least @22wiggins admits that, unlike Ktrash.oh shiet, almost forgot to put an alarm for today's game ahhh 🙌🏽 #dubnation  Golden State Warriors le's get itttt #game6 #NBAFinals https://t.co/MWqbH4SAmL@umichbball @warriors @celtics Waddup #BLUE@bmabram92 @warriors @957thegame @ESPNRadio @betwayusa Agreed… can’t trust a game (7)!  🤨😵‍💫@NBALatam Golden State Warriors #NBA75 #NBAFinals🏀2022 NBA Finals Game 6 Live Broadcast Streams Free HQ

There is a story of a man named David in a battle with Goliath.

David was brought armor-he refused it because he had never used armor, when fighting with beasts in his past.

He faced Goliath with what he knew and tested from experience-a sling and stones.Can the @Warriors (+145) close out @Celtics (-175) for the #NBATitle tonight?  Or will Boston do what they did against the defending champion #Bucks in round two and extend the series to 7?

Will the Golden State Warriors seal the deal tonight? 🍿 Jayson Tatum, Jaylen Brown and Marcus Smart are the favorite to win game 6 https://t.co/wJXiPMwWdkThat's what made @warriors so great! They didn't/don't have a Lebron James either.. That's why they had to go get KD. Steph is the greatest shooter, but he is not this physically overwhelming dude. So how can they be discounted when they are playing an equally matched team..? https://t.co/DMugdkVyeS@warriors Game day warriors lets go 🏀🏆Today the @warriors will bring a Championship home to San Francisco.

Why??@SlimReaper_3 @olsta @NBA @warriors @KlayThompson If you can't admit that officiating has been very one-sided in most of this series, then you simply aren't paying attention.  Or, you already had your mind made up before the series started.  Boston's only hope is that the NBA wants a game 7.“I’m not ready for this season to over yet” Jayson Tatum says he is willing to di everything to make Celtics cross the winning line https://t.co/RdZ1jgSg8T #BostonCeltics #GoldenStateWarriors@GrantLiffmann @NBCSWarriors @ATLHawks @warriors Best wishes on your new job.Insane stats suggests just why the Celtics loss in 2022 Finals would not affect Jayson Tatum’s legacy https://t.co/r3puqj0txm #BostonCeltics #GoldenStateWarriors“A little mental warfare is never a bad thing.” Meet the man behind the viral sign that caught @warriors star @stephencurry30 attention

Dubs Regardless https://t.co/nFN0ZgqaYN@warriors have a good chance to win tonight. Klay Thompson looked really good in Game 5. I think we get Game 6 Klay. Steph is going to hit 3-4 3 pt shots.

KD was the best player in the league that's 100% differentThe @warriors will win Game 6 of the #NBAFinals, 105-97@warriors cool@MattGeorgeSAC Reminds me of the story Draymond told, that when he first said to his mother after the draft that he'd be playing for the Golden State Warriors, she said not to worry, that he's still make the NBA some day ...“Stand up and CONQUER!” Jayson Tatum gets harsh reality check from Stephen A.

WARRIORS IN 6@RealSkipBayless @undisputed Its a challenge to the @warriors to finish the job on Game 6, whats wrong with that.  If they do really achieve that would it not haunt the Celtics more by losing at their homecourt.  Many doubted Golden State, how satisfying would it for them to prove them wrong.Did people have the same energy when Curry wanted to be @nyknicks and not @warriors@_Talkin_NBA @warriorsworld They also didn’t lose two in a row in a long ass time?

 #GoldenStateWarriors@NoahFer39948346 @bitcoinblenderb @OfficialNBARefs @celtics @warriors @ABCNetwork I’m not a Celtics fan nor warriors. I root for suns and wherever harden goes. And follow some others but again, I root for good basketball and game 5 was a sad day to watch basketball and I don’t like giving “ for winners and that game was unfair. Just really sad to watch@ralyxiv @warriors Kerr has to treat game 6 like its game 7. Cant play wit Boston@darrinbaker @dubnation_br @warriors KC Jones was a 7ppg guy 😂 Bill Havlicek and Cousy tho 👀@NoahFer39948346 @bitcoinblenderb @OfficialNBARefs @celtics @warriors @ABCNetwork 2 push offs, as well as another flop on top, and then also warriors can be aggressive but as soon as Celtics it’s a foul, the free throws should have been 60 to 15, it was a horrible ref game. Call if fair, and yes 31 to 15 in game 5 along with flops and techs not fair.Boston’s backs are against the wall heading into Game 6 of the NBA Finals, but Celtics star Jaylen Brown vowed they won’t back down against the Golden State Warriors. | #NBAFinals @manilabulletin
