You can carry on trying to convince others your a fan of Houston but don't harbor significant animus against McNair's for terrible player management, or being a Rockets fan who isn't silently dissapointed that Harden never actually cared@jkretsos126 @OrlandoMagic @trailblazers @HoustonRockets Oh you just donated $10 friendRudy Gay is out tonight against the Houston rockets with right heel sorenessThis was, by far, my favorite offensive play from the last Rockets game.

Houston featured Jalen Green off the catch more often than they usually do, and that was a big reason for his improved offensive performance.

And y'all know I'm a sucker for lob passes. https://t.co/eQCBxTQ8BtRudy Gay is also out tonight for the @utahjazz due to heel soreness. 

Donovan Mitchell (concussion) and Hassan Whiteside (safety protocols)  are also out against the @HoustonRockets.The Houston Rockets Eric Gordan had his gucci flip flops on during the first half.Josh Christopher is only halfway through his rookie year and his highlights are already INSANE! 🚀 @HoustonRockets

It’s true they want young players, but they want YOUNG SHOOTERS.@TheLakersReview Houston Rockets have a good point in not wanting THT.
