I was like 15 when they were born 😆For example, I would 100% do a daily/weekly Utah Jazz trivia quiz or wordle thingy and, in exchange for some stats on how I performed versus other fans, I would give some personal info and preferences. That’s zero-party data. Super useful for personalizing fan experience. #SSAC22I’ll spare you my notes on the Adobe-sponsored session, but I thought it was actually good! It was not a sales pitch. Our own Jen Zick talked about strategies for gathering zero-party data from fans for personalization. I kept thinking about the @utahjazz digital team. #SSAC22@travbryanmusic I would guess the Quin Snyder/Utah Jazz style.
