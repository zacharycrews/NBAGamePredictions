Certain nuances are lost with captioning but captured nicely via ASL and makes the team more personable to their fans! @Bucks #DeafAccess  #ASL https://t.co/YgqYZVfqTnOkay, so this Collapse has a punchline, which is that the Milwaukee Bucks won it all in 2021. But that outcome only makes the era preceding it more compelling and infuriating for all the other 29 NBA franchises. Life is unfair, just ask a Knicks fan. https://t.co/lsbK9z1KKxFriendship ended with @nuggets now @Bucks is my best friendG mfers just went full Chicago in front of the Milwaukee bucksChi-town gave @BPortistime a chance, but the @Bucks made him a champion! #ThePeoplesChamp https://t.co/1biriGiMZ4@Bucks Oh the other luca@GonzalezErik_ @Bucks If you wanna talk about history, mention the 90s when they actually made it to the finals, when they had D rose they got eliminated in the first round.HUUUGE @bucks win last night!

Stop the excuses.When Grayson Allen has done something good in the last week, his teammates have booed him.

With a playoff career-high 22 points, his teammates booed him an awful lot last night.
