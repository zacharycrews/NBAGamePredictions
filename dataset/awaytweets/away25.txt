The Stars played just 9 seasons, while the Jazz have played 48.

@utahjazz | #TakeNote https://t.co/pvZ9lquvwwI am grateful to be a Utah Jazz fan. All Jazz owners for my entire lifetime have fought against sexist people. The sexist that yelled at Russell Westbrook got banned for life from Jazz games by Gail Miller. Ryan Smith actively condemns racism as well.

Proud to be a Jazz fan🙏 https://t.co/LXiMryGsXAEveryone is talking about the @Lakers @nuggets @utahjazz in the west.

https://t.co/tfrNzNlN6zEvery year they try to tell us that the Utah Jazz are being slept on. We aren’t sleeping on them we just know they’re going to get put outSaying the Sacramento Kings must win tonight against the Utah Jazz would be beyond hyperbole, but I can't understate how important it is for the Kings to play well &amp; a win wouldn't be bad either. Sac has 1 of the best fans bases in the NBA, when they feel the passion of the team.@F3aR_WrLD If this happens I’ll be a Utah Jazz fan@utahjazz Wish you succes this season,greetz from Belgium :)@utahjazz @UofUHealth @vivintarena This is great! Hopefully it'll help a bunch of people get vaccinatedPower NBA

Utah Jazz -5.5 @ 1.86 3u
Orlando Magic +8.5 @ 1.90 1uRandom but sure @utahjazz https://t.co/TS9Z8RwQdE@MWCBear The Wizards might be the best defensive team in the NBA this year.  In the last 25 years, only the 2014-15 Utah Jazz allowed the fewest points per game in the entire NBA and missed the playoffs.In partnership with @UofUHealth, we are hosting a community vaccination event at @vivintarena next Friday, October 29.

As an Aussie Jazz fan, thank you Mike and Annie for your pledge! #LoveYourWork https://t.co/2wQidU14TFSo Wes Unseld Jr showed why he was hired as the Wizards head coach.  He is a tremendous defensive mind.  The last time a team missed the playoffs after allowed the fewest points per game in the entire league, was the 2014-15 Utah Jazz.  Before that, it was the 1996-97 Cavs!  GoodPeople hate the Utah Jazz so much they’re willing to spew the dumbest takes imaginable just to put them down. https://t.co/fBdKMwwW6UIt's only been one game, but I've seen enough to say that this Utah Jazz team is a national championship caliber team. #TakeNote
