#UtahJazz 
@hansenjames@TapeDelayJazz @Suns @warriors Wolters was an undrafted two-way contract signee for the Jazz, so again, that's not an apples-to-apples comparison for the Jazz's two DRAFTED 6'7" wings who are shooting 35% from 3 in the G league (not awesome, but not bad) but getting barely any minutes even in garbage time@TapeDelayJazz @Suns @warriors Yeah, so the difference is that while Lue developed ONE rookie by giving him time on the "varsity" team to be ready for the playoffs--and one was all that was necessary to destroy the Jazz--Quin is developing ZERO on the varsity level, not giving burn even when he can afford to@TapeDelayJazz @Suns @warriors Despite not being "developed" (your term), Robinson played 3x as many minutes in his rookie year and still more minutes across two teams than Oni did last year. 

So Lue didn't develop Robinson because he was TRADED, but thanks for asking@osteomath @Suns @warriors Right, Mann was more talented and a better player so Lue played him. It’s that simple. Lue wasn’t making some genius long term play so Mann could go off on the playoffs. He had a good player and he played him.@TapeDelayJazz @Suns @warriors Walton joined the Clips as a summer-league pickup, not contracted draftees like Hughes and Oni, and he was backup to Robinson and Mann, so the wasn't a need to develop Walton like there is a need to develop 3-and-D players on the Jazz so they don't get pwned in the playoffs again@TapeDelayJazz @Suns @warriors Motley was undrafted (since you seem to prioritize on prior talent level) and traded to Clips as a two-way player--the first such trade--so he was slated to be a G-leaguer from the get-go. Oh, and his career 3-point shooting is &lt;20%, so unlike Mann, Motley's not a 3-and-D player@smellydookieee @KevinFlocksTiTz @Suns @Ballislife @NBA @DevinBook they can’t talk about championships though 😂@ESPNNBA @KendrickPerkins No one from the @Suns would be wrong@DenisesHusband @NBA @Suns Fair.

It's a LUXURY to be able to develop players and still have a chance to win. GSW is.@TapeDelayJazz @Suns @warriors Getting center-court time is an essential part of fully developing. 

Because if they ever are needed, they need center-court experience; G league isn't enough.

I don't see Quin trying to get ANY young player--not Butler, Hughes, Oni, Paschall--that key time.

Lue did. LAC won.@LilMonsterJDR @MyNBADrakeBull1 @SanicDaHedge @Suns @JaValeMcGee But you don’t need to keep saying it every time because everybody knows that, you’re acting like you want the Suns to win a ringWoof, these needed a few more drafts before being produced.

Also, they better hope the Phoenix Suns don’t see them. https://t.co/PnfWZKRoOJ@TapeDelayJazz @Suns @warriors No; obviously natural talent plays a role.

Poole is probably more talented than Oni.

This guy is 25 years old and he's scoring 20+ ppg for 6 season straight.  If he'll not get injured, i think he has a great chance to be the part of 30k+ club@RStabb26 @stephen_richer @jacksellers @Suns Can shadegg explain how his own election was valid...on the exact same ballots? 

Or how hotel ballrooms are not hearings? 

Or how Powell was SO STUPID her plaintiff, Staci Burk, was not even a registered AZ voter. 

Or how Hickman's chickens voted?@SalenaNiemann @DevinBook @Suns @NBA Wow this is awesome🔥🔥🔥@cfcxpert_ @NigeriaBasket We have other great guys that we can call to play for Nigeria, Monte Morris, deandre(phoenix suns) Obadiah toppins (Atlanta hawks) og anuolby Toronto raptors@stephen_richer @Suns Of course he is proud of Team Cuck!👍

This is my contribution to the Jack Murphy conversation

I hope it was helpful👍👏@lindseyrbhair @Suns That’s a great seat!@Medved_1337 @NbaGenius548 @pprelk @statmuse @Suns @DevinBook I mean you can say what you want. I have 0 issues taking the L to the Bucks. All respect to Giannis, he busted his ass and was hitting jumpers and even FTs. But it's pretty obvious that the height disadvantage tipped the scale in their favor in the close losses. It's just a fact."SHAZAM!"

How did legendary @Suns broadcaster Al McCoy come up with his signature call for a 3-point shot? The answer he gave to @DavePasch may surprise you.

I was looking for the mitts. 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣@moc_dude @Suns @JaValeMcGee congrats man, that's so dope@toeknee216 @Suns It was so much fun!@MrChuckD @Suns @marioelie1 @ErniePaniccioli This is dope! Shout out to Mario!@1776Reporting @stephen_richer @Suns What pretty pictures! You should put together a coloring book.@suns I'm sure you're getting alot of interest from great players so let me describe my abilities as they'll translate to the NBA. I will likely not be able to stop even 42 year old Joe Johnson and my only chance to score will likely be off a free throw. Like I said, I'm ready.@osteomath @Suns @warriors Poole and Bridges are just better players than Oni and Hughes. Coaches aren’t dumb. Time on the court is not some fool proof guarantee for player progress and development. You could play oni and Hughes 30 min a night and they aren’t turning into Jordan Poole.@MrChuckD @Suns @marioelie1 @ErniePaniccioli @LoveThePuck When that bonkers Arizona vote recount was happening, I recognized the building's paneled ceiling from all those Kevin Johnson &amp; Tom Chambers dunks.

Projection from a guy not man enough to admit he is wrong. 

Getting conned by Dennis Montgomery twice is a pretty EPIC fail for the AZ GOP.@smellydookieee @Suns @Ballislife @NBA @DevinBook Wow u think Lakers won’t win another championship in future decade u must not knw what our team owner is or our GM 🤣 thanks to them we got Lebron and AD on the Lakers they made moves to get us another championship and I believe they will do the same this year make trades.In 2022 it would be nice, just one time that either the @Suns or @AZCardinals win the Championship 🙏🏽 both have been so close but couldn’t finish the job.Welcome to the Suns family, @nbatopshot!

#ValleyProud @Suns https://t.co/VN2pxHGbf9@TapeDelayJazz Evidently we're not going to agree.

Because while @suns and @warriors are developing wings such as Bridges and Poole, respectively, by PLAYING THEM, Quin somehow thinks that it's a better strategy to parade out an undermotivated, slow, T-happy Aussie even vs Blazers

31.0 ppg
5.5 rpg
4.0 apg
1.5 spg
57% from three (12/21).
2-0 this week for the Hornets.
If he play like that on Sunday against the Phoenix Suns he could be EASILY be the Eastern Conference Player of The Week.
