Utah Jazz vs Dallas Mavericks https://t.co/IZrM61ShW8@gunner9414 @JohnDamalos @utahjazz I think the Mavericks could have advanced the ball if they wanted to but they chose not to. With 11 secs left, Kidd felt the team could create more movement and space on screens by using the whole court instead of half. Some teams like doing thisBrooklyn Nets - Boston Celtics
Toronto Blue Jays - Boston Red Sox

THE FiNALS!! I would say that is close.  And both game sixes were very close games.  So in my opinion the Jazz were very close to winning a championship.  Obviously you can see how hard it is to get to the finals.@BensHoops @utahjazz @dallasmavs Do you know whether it will also be available on ATT Sportsnet?@BensHoops @utahjazz @dallasmavs Seems strange that they would move the Jazz game to NBATV regardless of whether those teams continue.

CAPTION: @utahjazz Player: Make Room For Hinie .The Utah Jazz have never played the New Orleans Pelicans/Hornets in the playoffs and it might just happen if things keep up. Considering the history &amp; people’s feelings on Utah being the Jazz, it might be special &amp; fun. 

Utah should invest in all things Jazz Music imo lol.Why there is urgency to get it done this year and not say there's always next: Remember when the Utah Jazz had the best record in the NBA ... last year?@BensHoops Go cover the Utah jazz??? You weird man@jayjazz3 Why include his time with the Cavaliers into this discussion when he isn’t remotely the same player or situation?

He’s been a positive overall in the playoffs as a member of the Utah Jazz, yes.NBA name proposal: 

Utah Jazz give their name back to New Orleans because give me a break.

The Grizzlies name comes to Utah.

Memphis becomes The Memphis Blues.Everyone is talking about the 8 second violation to cp3. Is it just me or did anyone else see that the @utahjazz caused an 8 second violation by Luka yesterday that didn't get called? #nba #TakeNoteThe reports of the @PelicansNBA’s and @utahjazz’s were greatly exaggerated. #NBAonTNT #NBA75Dear Pelicans...I'm so fucking glad you beat the Suns AGAIN.

For instance.
Don/Grayson/Bogey/Jae/Gobert 
With Clarkson/Royce/House/Juancho/Whiteside off the bench is tough.@StanleyRoberts @utahjazz But those great jazz bars in Salt Lake feature Joe Smith, his brother Jon Smith and their half brother Tim SmithRudy is officially invested in the rebrand. #fckthetalk Take Note and make it happen @utahjazz. 🤬 https://t.co/pM43k3I7PH@pROBablyStewart @utahjazz Does a current jazz squad with Rubio/Grayson instead of Conley make the Jazz a lot better?.@utahjazz  was an expansion team from New Orleans, a place many call the birthplace of Jazz...

The refs didn’t call it an offensive foul in real time and I didn’t think it more egregious than other similar calls they have let go
