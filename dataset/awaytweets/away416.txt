https://t.co/5L9zoNanF5@femaleatlhawk @ATLHawks @SteveKoonin Facts@ATLHawks Simmons is one of the top 5 defenders in the NBA.  Our biggest weakness is perimeter defense.   He is also one of the most dangerous scorers off the dribble.   We have lots of shooters but not a lot who can create off the dribble and take the load off of Trae.@CongerCorey @BiasedHouston @ATLHawks He's still signed for next year.

https://t.co/w5BBibKdCZ@R41958015 @buckheadlawyer @ATLHawks Remember that Bogdanovic is one of the top 10 shooting guards in the NBA, and while she was injured you played Cam redish, the most unstable player in history, and the mediocre Huerter.@R41958015 @buckheadlawyer @ATLHawks Milwaukee would have won the series sooner if it hadn't been for bogdanovic in the game that injured Giannis. He was also Atlanta's most stable player after returning from injury during the regular season.@R41958015 @buckheadlawyer @ATLHawks the series would have started 2-0 had it not been for the three-pointers at the end, the fouls the team made when they couldn't get out of the pressure, and the free throws. continue .@R41958015 @buckheadlawyer @ATLHawks hey, let's take a look at the playoffs. In MSG's first game, Atlanta was 4-5 points behind, and New York would have won that game without Bogdanovic's critical three-pointer and the series would have started 2-0. It has a huge impact on the sequel.

Pick #1: CBB Akron +3.5 (C)
Pick #2: NBA Atlanta Hawks/Orlando Magic OVER 224 (DK)
Pick #3: NBA Houston Rockets/Cleveland Cavaliers OVER 220.5 (DK)@ATLHawks I agree with everyone of the tweets. In summary, this team is cocky after last year‚Äôs surprising season. They have forgotten that games are won or lost in 4Q. As all of you tweeted, have to play hard the entire game. 
Think coach can turn it around?@BiasedHouston @CongerCorey @ATLHawks If the hawks asked for a pick I'd literally hang up the phone. Lmao!

We wouldn't do that@CongerCorey @BiasedHouston @ATLHawks Nope. Keep Reddish then. Eg is shooting 40%+ right now from 3. He's a good defender. He's also consistent. We're stacked at the wing right now. Houston doing Gordon a solid by putting him on a contender. Houston is not going to give a pick for Reddish.@ATLHawks @TeaCooper2 @SharifeCooper Give him playing time@rayfordyoung @colefaith4 @ATLHawks TRUST TRAE@ATLHawks @camreddish @TheTraeYoung @timcabs @gallinari8888 Need to get back on track with a W, guys.@mabinanba @ATLHawks marry me@SmokedbySoler12 @ATLHawks oh shitüòçüòçGot The Dub!
