Meanwhile, the @Suns extend their winning streak to 6 games, and the @Timberwolves and @Lakers fight to avoid a play-in scenario! üèÄ üìà

DeRozan had 41 pts

The Magic looked really good, beating the Bulls by 19 pts. 7 guys in double digit scoring.

The initial hard foul I can tolerate, but the swing at Caruso's head and yank with the left handYou know things are going bad when an 8-win @OrlandoMagic team starts to pound their chest and trash talk as they beat you by nearly 20 points.

Now give him some help pls@chicagobulls @HorizonNews Playing that defense@chicagobulls @NBCSChicago @DeMar_DeRozan Waive Vucevic@nbagleague @Cboogie_3 @slcstars @chicagobulls you need to make a trade for Carsen. It probably wont cost much. Seeing how many injuries the bulls have, you need another pure scorer.@chicagobulls #kidsnation looks so fun....I wish I were still a kid. 
Where is #kazaam.....make me a kid again lolWhat body control by DeMar.

@NBCSChicago | @DeMar_DeRozan https://t.co/FJDwZjdsz5@Bucks I get gentle razzing of @chicagobulls fans attending the game in your beautiful building. "Congratulations on finally having a competitive team" was pretty over the top. Then, (2/7)This is a DeMar appreciation post @chicagobulls, @NBCSBulls, #BullsNation https://t.co/mJc4ToMb4h@chicagobulls @HorizonNews sometimes I have to remember that it's the NBA &amp; any team can be beat!! But damn üòí@7AM51522574 @imamretired @arturasfanclub @chicagobulls @HorizonNews You literally just said what I said lol@chicagobulls @HorizonNews That attitude!

They all need to learn to play like him. @chicagobulls #BullsNation #CHIvsORLThe Chicago Bulls are so annoying@chicagobulls @HorizonNews bulls about to get trounced by the worst team in the East lol@chicagobulls let‚Äôs gooo bulllsssss üêÉ@chicagobulls @HorizonNews Nevertheless a disturbing recent trend of being down and not having a healthy roster to complete comebacks.@chicagobulls we need the hype even if we‚Äôre downHow do the @chicagobulls get blown out by @OrlandoMagic ü§îü§îü§î@chicagobulls @HorizonNews Not watching this again until everyone gets back. Tired of being down 10 every game at the end of the 3rd quarterThe Chicago Bulls probably got the worst bench in the league.@chicagobulls Bulls nearly shift into out of being a title contender.@moriartysports Am 58 years old.  I hope this is the year they get it done.
KC is so fricking good.  Sort of feels Buffalo is the NY Knicks (with Ewing)  and KC is Chicago Bulls (with Jordan)  We will have years of this rivalry and I hope the Bills aren't 2nd place everytime.@BN_Bulls @Michael_Cerami Ok if that‚Äôs the way the Bucks really feel then it‚Äôs open season on every Buck player! Next time Chicago plays the Bucks Donavan can send a hardly used player like Hill or Bradley to take out Anyetokounmpo or Middleton. Then let‚Äôs see how the Bucks feel about that!@chicagobulls @HorizonNews Yes we are out, stop tweeting. We are probably not gonna win a game till Zach is back@chicagobulls @HorizonNews Just bad.@ctsbulls @chicagobulls @Audacy @670TheScore St. Charles!!@BOOMBOOMISCRACK @chicagobulls @HorizonNews :( we have most of our team out on injury@chicagobulls @HorizonNews Go home poor Demar played alone this game game would have been closer if he played alone vs the magic ffsNah, the Chicago Bulls are really bad lmao@BOOMBOOMISCRACK @chicagobulls magics have 0 championships and are 8-39, please take that shit somewhere else LMFAOOOOOHad to turn off the Bulls game. It‚Äôs disgusting the lack of effort defensively they play with when Caruso is out. Being man handled by an 8 win team. #ChicagoBulls @WaddleandSilvy@chicagobulls @HorizonNews Hope we get some players back before we drop too many games against these lower teams@chicagobulls @HorizonNews Gonna lose to the magic you bums üòÇüòÇüòÇ@Bulls_Peck How long before we start taking about this vooch trade as one of the worst in Chicago sports history?@chicagobulls @HorizonNews how you losing to a 8 win team?Chicago Bulls, and Nikola Vucevic just ruined my night completely.The Chicago Bulls officially suck@chicagobulls @NBCSChicago @NikolaVucevic Trade Vooch now that he has a lil value left. Get him out of here , and get TBJ out too. Can't stand these guys ffs@chicagobulls losing to the Magic you bums üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇIDC if the @chicagobulls are down players !!! THE #Bulls are being embarrassed by a crappy @OrlandoMagic team. Even @Stacey21King is mad about this poor effort.  VOOCH playing like crap.  He's so inconsistent this year #bullsnation@chicagobulls @HorizonNews Vooch is absolutely getting taken apart on defense. They just keep running pick and rolls on him, and his man keeps slipping for easy layups.Injuries or not, this was an embarrassing performance @chicagobulls@chicagobulls @HorizonNews Get it together@ctsbulls @chicagobulls @Audacy @670TheScore In Denver. Just researched Wagner and discovered there are two big guys. Must be a story line there (and maybe you have been covering it while I only half listen). Born Berlin and both played at Michigan.Nikola Vucevic is the worst center in Chicago Bulls historySorry Bulls fans, but the NBC Chicago broadcasters are awful@FCBTRANSLATED @imamretired @arturasfanclub @chicagobulls @HorizonNews He doesn't know how to play, you mean.
I have no clue what Vooch is doing right now. He's lost on defense, and is getting outsmarted by younger players.@ctsbulls @chicagobulls @Audacy @670TheScore Enjoying the broadcast as always from cold and snowy South bend. A win Would be niceMan if ya dont turn up ya gon fuck up my ticket @chicagobullsHere we go @NBA #refs @chicagobulls #SeeRed #BullsNation@incredelman_11 Tom Brady will retire a Chicago Bulls point guard. Save this tweet@davidaxelrod @chicagobulls So is the best strategy to purposefully take out Giannis in March and have a role player miss one game?@chicagobulls @HorizonNews Imagine losing to the Magic ü§£@chicagobulls piss poor effort, disgust me@chicagobulls @HorizonNews Now or never.@imamretired @arturasfanclub @chicagobulls @HorizonNews Bro doesn‚Äôt know how to play like a veteran@chicagobulls @HorizonNews Vooch came to play‚Ä¶ 4/16 FG, 5TO, 5 Fouls ü•µHow many games should Bucks' Grayson Allen be suspended for causing the flagrant foul that broke Alex Caruso's wrist?
