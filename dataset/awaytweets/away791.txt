@Suns aren't getting Sabonis.  Indy is surely asking for one of our core players.The Suns are 50/50 when laying 8 or more. But Washington is on a dreadful 2-12 ATS run, Phoenix is 2-0 as road faves of 8-plus, and they beat the Wizards by 20 last out. Seems like a lot.

Rockets could probably get a better pick elsewhere, but Phoenix is by far the best fit. https://t.co/LpcBrMIkbD@Suns HELLOOO???? trade now https://t.co/UiLJms0NgRPhoenix Suns fans seem to get it. They understand Eric Gordon's value. They know the special opportunity their team has. They are fine with trading a first-round pick.

For what you get, that Sabonis contract is nice.@Suns @DevinBook Coach Monty Williams is such a great man and coach.I’ve been saying it all season, we don’t need another big, we need a backup PG and SG.

The sun is out and it is hot 😊.We are heading to Phoenix,  what are your weekend plans? #Mauritius https://t.co/jeyNy4PoI6@maxmcc11 @Suns Plus Sabonis has never played with a PG like CP3 how much better could he be with CP3@maxmcc11 @Suns I’m on my knees @Suns https://t.co/yfbBHqs7wX@maxmcc11 @Suns I’m going all in for the DA for Sabonis makes so much sense for the Suns better rebounder scorer and passer plays hard all the time which goes so far with team  chemistry plus the cap implications as sabonis is signed to 3x  20 mill deal DA is gonna get maxed for sure this summer@maxmcc11 @Suns You’re scared of Dallas? Gets their shit together?@maxmcc11 @Suns It’s gonna be hilarious when Dallas gets the third seed and still has to play Kawhi and PG in the first roundSend it @Suns https://t.co/p74Jd7MI74 https://t.co/tkIuZ73HqY@maxmcc11 @Suns You mean, you DON'T want Sabonis??? 🙃Hey @suns Trade for Eric Gordon please. Strike before Dallas gets its shit together. https://t.co/WVTy6swv09@VinLospinuso91 But unless the Suns have something in their lease that gives them some sort of exclusivity, the City of Phoenix owns the building and can determine who its tenants are. Now the hockey team might take second priority. And there would be a cost to retrofit again.Day 21: @DevinBook 
Now 3 days away from watching the suns and bulls both top in the east and west, but we all know Phoenix is gonna win, and I can’t wait to see booker play cause the last time I saw him he was good but no where near where he is now@marcusfromstore @tabet_matthew @statmuse @Suns @KDTrey5 in a suns Jersey would basically mean a guaranteed finals championship@Jumpshot8 @Suns Hey Jumpsuit! You think the Suns may have peaked early? How hard is it to maintain playing at a high level for an entire NBA season?

They don’t compare to the 6 ring warriors dynasty@NHL To #GaryBettman - Phoenix needs an NHL team that plays in central Phoenix (or very close by) and is called "Phoenix." If that happens, it will be supported like the #PhoenixSuns are supported (and have been for 54 years).@justinreyesv @tabet_matthew @statmuse @Suns Ngl him in a suns jersey is fucking hilarious@tabet_matthew @statmuse If that happens @Suns will be unstoppable..@Jumpshot8 @Suns Eddie shut upPlease keep DA and Cam 🙏 @Suns https://t.co/9pPTy50KWC@treyzdrivezfan @JC04066123 @Jumpshot8 @THATS_FlNE @Suns What Eddie is trying to say is the Suns lost to a team that lost to the Pacers G league team, that’s how bad the Suns performed.Check out Devin Booker 2021-22 Panini Sticker &amp; Card NBA Card #5 Phoenix Suns Silver https://t.co/xnqqh74VRj @eBay@uselesstinsel @kirkgoldsberry @celtics @Suns @nuggets @dallasmavs @Timberwolves @Lakers @warriors @BrooklynNets @chicagobulls @utahjazz MY SUB HAS FUCKING BACON 🥓@uselesstinsel @kirkgoldsberry @celtics @Suns @nuggets @dallasmavs @Timberwolves @Lakers @warriors @BrooklynNets @chicagobulls @utahjazz Someone’s cranky ☘️☘️☘️🍿🍿🍿MORE SHOTS TAKEN FROM BOOK ANS AYTON STOP @SUNSDomantas Sabonis Phoenix Suns Trade Rumor (My Thoughts) https://t.co/27rnEGjPWb via @YouTube #Suns #NBATradeDeadline@jamesabaileyjr I hope he comes back in time for Phoenix Suns!!!@Kenneth63372372 @Suns @toeknee216 @Emack5inAz @TuffPlayz @OhImAlex @FlexFromJersey @Patsnation87 @ValleySunna @MatthewLissy @DarthVoita @Jumpshot8 @nickialanoche No. Jae brings an edge and we need Cam's scoring off the bench.Phoenix Suns https://t.co/RX3TP9HZWQ via @YouTube@itspcthemac @JustSportsAZ @Suns @DevinBook thanks I was curious.

When healthy I just don’t see anyone stopping GSW@Redsunhero @Suns @DevinBook Try again. I just realized that the setting to allow DMs from everyone was not enabled.@THATS_FlNE @Jumpshot8 @Suns Warriors fans tweet about the suns more than their own team. That alone shows how scared they are. Sad scene really…@JustSportsAZ @Suns @DevinBook Sure thing. Is there anyway I can DM you the order? There is not DM option on your page.@Jumpshot8 @Abdiaziz1h @Suns I feel you, Mr. Johnson. Fans have no control over outcomes but they sure love to tell the world what's going to happen.
😆😆😆“A True Point Guard Pt. 2”, put together by Coach FL III. I just wanted to share with you all another “True Point Guard” video. These clips I put together are of Chris Paul from his 2007-2008 season with the New Orleans Hornets and his 2020-2021 season with the Phoenix Suns.@Abdiaziz1h @LeonisWord @Suns Too bad your thoughts mean zippo in the basketball world. 🙂@THATS_FlNE @Suns Then lost to Pacers G league team. We good. Merry Xmas.@Abdiaziz1h @Jumpshot8 @Suns We'll see. I don't do predictions in February. Too much can happen. Enjoy the ride and hope Draymond is gonna be ok. Without him, it's a wrap.

"Chris Paul isn't half the leader that Neal Walk was."@Abdiaziz1h @Jumpshot8 @Suns They might. As might the Warriors. I root for the Dubs but I've learned that assuming one team is going to fall off just so I can feel good about my team's chances is silly. We'll see.@mrsupermanohere @Suns @DevinBook Yes there will be more. I don't have a ship date confirmed, but based on how shipments have been picking up recently, we are hoping it will be in the next couple of weeks. No guarantees, but that's what I am hoping.@LeonisWord @Jumpshot8 @Suns Suns will fall short@GoRilla_AZ1 @Suns @DevinBook I am not sure. Let me check. I know we just got the white ones in, but I am not sure about these.@Jumpshot8 @Suns How about some more love for these @Raptors Eddie?@al_osei @casualtakeking @Suns Giannis dropped 40 in game 2 and they lost its more likely giannis keep them in the game till they figured it put@Raptors @ScottBarnes561 @Suns @MiamiHEAT x2 @chicagobulls @ATLHawks cant no one stop this team right now.@Abdiaziz1h @Jumpshot8 @Suns But I understand. The fan in you won't allow you to be honest. That's the Western Conference Finals match up, most likely but Day-Day gotta be right and Steph gotta get that % up. This isn't 2018.@Abdiaziz1h @Jumpshot8 @Suns Not today!@CaydenDavison6 @Jumpshot8 @Suns The Warriors have more lazy off nights than the Suns in the regular season. When all the chips are on the line in big games with everyone healthy, the Warriors are the better team and will win in the playoffs.@Redsunhero @Suns @DevinBook Can you confirm the order # for me so I can be sure I am looking at the correct order?@Jumpshot8 @Suns Used to love the Suns.  But you’re so arrogant and make it impossible to cheer for that team now.  ✌️@Jumpshot8 @Suns Good till you hit them conference finals@LeonisWord @Jumpshot8 @Suns it don't matter warriors better@THATS_FlNE @Jumpshot8 @Suns Also lost to the wolves by 20 and the pels lmao@Abdiaziz1h @Jumpshot8 @Suns Maybe.
