https://t.co/GpM0g45jmRThe Philadelphia 76ers would love the New Orleans Pelicans in the finals if they traded Devin Booker for an experienced defender #HereTheyCome #WBD https://t.co/Mdsg8p0YQRNBA Basketball Game Betting Picks Simulator: 3/20/2022 6:00 PM ET - New Orleans Pelicans vs. Atlanta Hawks - YOU CAN RUN THE GAME SIMULATION FOR FREE HERE: https://t.co/E8lqComFM0 #nba #sportsbetting #freepicks #cappertekAD returning to end the Pelicans season in New Orleans would be a nice consolation prize for this season. So I’m not sweating them falling to 10th.@CliffMeans @ChaszJohnson 1st attempt to trade for A.D failed because of Coach Greg Popovich, New Orleans Pelicans GM Dell Demps was a protege of Popovich.
2nd attempt succeeded because former Cleveland Cavs GM took over.There are a couple of Coach K's players in New Orleans.
