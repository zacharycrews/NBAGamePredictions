Him for their 1st round this year, next year, and the following year, Devonte Graham, Josh Hart, and Kira Lewis Jr, might be a good Idea. the only concern is that Beal might not want to good to pelicans.@MrChuckD @PelicansNBA @hornets @SeattleSonics But I doubt Adam Silver and the @NBA let the @PelicansNBA leave NOLA cause all we would have is the @Saints and tourism. The financial support isn‚Äôt in New Orleans whereas Seattle has @Amazon @Microsoft @Google @Costco @Facebook Seattle is the iCloud version of Silicon Valley‚Ä¶@MrChuckD I‚Äôm from New Orleans Chuck, the Lower 9th Ward born and raised. I played for the @PelicansNBA but they were the @hornets then in 2002. 

Seattle deserves the @SeattleSonics back but I don‚Äôt want it that way. No doubt Seattle would support the team better do to it‚Äôs robust economyLike when the Charlotte Hornets play the New Orleans Pelicans. Only difference is at one time it was the Charlotte Bobcats and the New Orleans Hornets. https://t.co/dZaELoIQ10New Orleans Pelicans' Zion Williamson suffers setback in recovery from foot surgery - via @ESPN App https://t.co/PEZBqqOdL1@YahooFantasyCC Herbert Jones is the starting PF for the New Orleans Pelicans. Yet, he is only given the SF designation. Can you please give both SF and PF.The Krause House (named after the late Chicago Bulls GM Jerry Krause) created a plan that‚Äôs a combination of blockchain-based fundraising and old-style grassroots organizing. 

They're trying to buy the New Orleans Pelicans. https://t.co/Air5RHW468@GPFree75 @ATL_Jonesin @ScottDKushner Because players don't see New Orleans as a place they want to go as free agent or play for. Two things are going to happen with Zion. Either he becomes the next Greg Oden or he leaves the team when his contract is up. Pelicans have two landing spots.

Donnie will make the moves to keep Zion happy and ensure New Orleans is a respectable franchise again. We #MFFL miss Donnie!Zach Randolph was the most Memphis basketball player that will ever exist &amp; it was a treat to watch him battle as a Memphis grizzlies player - a New Orleans kid &amp; a pelicans fan@PelicansNBA speedy recovery Z, i still believe you can do more and more for the city of new orleans. fighting!!!!@UnwrittenRul3s New Orleans pelicans blowing out the warriors.New Orleans Pelicans‚Äô Zion Williamson suffers setback in recovery from foot¬†surgery https://t.co/EcHe7HzH9NI‚Äôll take all of the heat from Pelicans Twitter at times if it means people are passionate about basketball.

RT @_Andrew_Lopez: Statement from the New Orleans Pelicans on Zion Williamson: https://t.co/ca96h8xjzQ@ATL_Jonesin @ScottDKushner The only thing i disagree with you is NBA doesn't have a place in New Orleans.If Pelicans would start winning they will pack the arena.They are scared to let Zion go because they know he will bring in the money for them.Zion's setback + #Pelicans awful record = lots of negative media about New Orleans

FICTION: Pelicans are moving or being sold 

***AS LONG AS GAYLE BENSON IS ALIVE, PELICANS WILL BE IN NOLA!!!

FACT: Zion probably does want to move on from New Orleans and play somewhere else https://t.co/WvwNQH3UAK@ScottDKushner It is like i have been saying.Zion doesn't want to be in New Orleans.He has been pouting since the Pelicans drafted https://t.co/Jk1NySMe4a noticed Zion has been quite for a few months.He hardly says anything.Time to cut our losses.@Ballislife @nbagleague New Orleans Pelicans definitely need him he‚Äôs a walking bucket!

https://t.co/ig4N3Kebhv #PSETODAY #PSEI #PhilippinesZion Williamson, the New Orleans Pelicans star whose NBA rise has been hampered by injury, has suffered another setback in his return from right foot surgery, the team said. https://t.co/QAfxWmaYLrSad thing is the Pelicans done in New Orleans when Zion gone. Failure on both sides with Griffin and that 4th pick and the 2020 pick but Zion failing them tooThe media continues to position New Orleans sports fans as Saints vs Pelicans. That‚Äôs not the choice. It‚Äôs winning vs mediocrity or worse. Let the Saints string together a few 3-14 seasons and see how the attendance looks.@NBA @NBAonTNT @PelicansNBA @FirstTake Sorry new orleans but Zion W is going to be a bust!
