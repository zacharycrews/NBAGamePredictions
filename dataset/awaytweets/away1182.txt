📊 @betwayusaYo sigo ➡️ Milwaukee Bucks https://t.co/Dx0vqbHAdv@Bucks - This is another reason he may go down as the greatest foreign born nba player ever. He’s only 27 and is just getting started in his prime. Just incredible.

- https://t.co/OhI64dQkfKFun fact: when the heat beat the bucks in 2020 the heat were the best 3pt shooting team in the nba and Milwaukee was one of the worst at defending the 3. This year we are the best 3 pt shooting team again and Milwaukee is 30th in the  nba at defending the 3. https://t.co/3eXdWxch8c@Bucks - I’m looking at Giannis career thus far and man he’s achieved a ton at 27 years old.
