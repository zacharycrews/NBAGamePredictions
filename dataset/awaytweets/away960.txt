#LEGENDoftheMiamiHEAT #NBA75I’m a big fan of Franz Wagners’ game. 

That dude is slick with the ball for being so big. 

#MemphisGrizzliesJust bought a Memphis Grizzlies jersey!

This Nike Swoosh sold for $2,730 on auction. 

What do you think this card with a game worn swoosh would command? Double? Or more? Are the Grizzlies a legit contender this season? 

#memphisgrizzlies #jamorant #nba #swoosh https://t.co/2CwpcKpGKxif the scores stay the same, my Memphis Grizzlies will have the second best record in the NBA, and we haven't had our best perimeter defender and second leading scorer Dillon Brooks for 43 games this season, I love this team @memgrizz 💙 2nd youngest team in the league btwI’ve got to catch a Memphis Grizzlies game at this pointMemphis Grizzlies 68 x 45 Orlando Magic
