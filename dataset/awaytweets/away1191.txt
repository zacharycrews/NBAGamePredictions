Toughest part of this pick is the Wizards win, but they’ve been playing great since Porzingis came on the roster. I don’t think this is tough at all for the odds.

Bet slip link: https://t.co/QBSh7pOjNj https://t.co/0wZs7nbr0DI’ve seen enough. 

The Washington Wizards are the best team of all time. I wouldn’t be surprised if they’re shooting 101% from the field.Wizards timeout: 96-86 Wizards 

Porzingis is going crazy now, not missing. Washington is shooting 52% from 3, and a lot of their makes are on open looks. Minnesota again proves they can’t pressure the ball without Beverley. 

Still 14 mins left in the gameTimberwolves in must win game trail Washington 67-66 at half.Washington use to be the Bullets not Wizards.Wes Unseld Jr is the Head coach.His dad was 6-7 tough as nails Hall of Famer- Led Bullets to only NBA title.☝️🏀Halftime in Minneapolis, Wizards lead 67-66:

KAT: 15pts / 5r / 3a 🔥
DLo: 15 pts / 6a / 6-10fg 🥶
Beasley: 14 pts / 4-7 3pm 🎯

Washington’s bench out-scoring ours 21-11, need the guys to turn up in the second half 🐺

#RaisedByWolvesEnd of the first half, the Wizards lead the Timberwolves 67-66. Washington shooting 58%, Minnesota 50%. Russell and Towns with 15 each. Beasley with 14. Kristaps with 13.Has any team dunked on the Wolves this season more than the Washington Wizards have?@Broncos_Reddit Also the Washington WizardsWizards timeout: 60-55 Wizards 

Defense needs to get tougher, Washington is just walking through us. 

Offense has been nice, but I really need to see Ant more involved. And the FT’s have been really off in the 2nd Q.BTW when did the Washington Wizards become so good all of a sudden?At half time I’m gonna put the eucalyptus leaves up, light a candle, and pour a glass of wine to enjoy the trilling climax of the Washington Wizards vs Minnesota TimberwolvesJoe Biden’s team is here Washington Wizards 🏀Timberwolves lead 38-35 Karl Anthony Towns 15 points.🌂After one.Watching the Washington Wizards game.
