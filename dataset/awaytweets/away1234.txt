Full update on @umichbball in the NBA: https://t.co/JCkQ7hfpzC https://t.co/09BBFTw475This season, Trae averaged 28.4 PPG and 9.7 AST, tied for 5th in scoring. 2 out of his first 4 years in the league, he has been in the top 5 in scoring. That seems good. Prices continue to edge lower. https://t.co/uKE9hMMUfP #atlantahawks #traeyoung #sportscards #basketballcards https://t.co/dPg2Cyg7DjThe @ATLHawks and @cavs face off for round two of the NBA Play-In tournament tonight.
