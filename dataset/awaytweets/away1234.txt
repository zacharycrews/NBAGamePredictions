They went 20-5 without Ja and Hawks were consistently awful without Trae on the court. People love wins, flash, and breakouts that confirm they’re expectations for a player they like. Ja had a lot going for him, even if Trae was betterLet’s shock the world again tonight @ATLHawks #BelieveAtlanta.@KennethNugent has donated $3 to the Hawks Foundation for #ScoreForScholarships with every point we scored this season!

5% Atlanta Hawks Team Total Over 112' (-110)@johnewing @Bet_Labs @ATLHawks Play in games aren’t actually the playoffs, though@Shonuff_253 @HawksMuse @statmuse @ATLHawks It’s definitely a fair argument. But not Ja’s fault he’s got a stronger supporting cast than Trae. And they were awesome when Ja played too. If Hawks had 7 more wins Trae is a lock on 2nd team and has a legit argument for 1st team. Hopefully next year.Wayne Root

Atlanta hawks MLThe #NBA Play-In Tournament concludes Friday, with the Atlanta Hawks facing the Cleveland Cavaliers and the New Orleans Pelicans visiting the Los Angeles Clippers.

Of the four teams playing in Friday's games, who do you think has the best chance of making a deep playoff run?1. Buy a place in Florence, Venice, and Lake Como
2. Pay off all debt 
3. Donate enough money to UF to have the football stadium named after me @GatorsFB 
4. Buy the @ATLHawks so I could have dinner with @TheTraeYoung and his fiancée
5. Donate lots of money to children in need https://t.co/HgurgjjgMP@SextonSeason Rayford Trae Young is an American professional basketball player for the Atlanta Hawks of the National Basketball Association.
