I’ll be at the game tonight, fully prepared to #SeeRed. My only problem is last time I went in MKE, I WORE Red &amp; #MyBulls lost by 3 touchdowns. Is it OK for me to #WearGray while I #SeeRed?

Please advise.

Kind &amp; warm regards.
-ToeKneeThe Chicago Bulls take on the Milwaukee Bucks in Game 2 of their 2022 Eastern Conference Quarter Final Series, today in WI. The Bulls lost game 1 and they need to play with urgency because falling behind 2 games to zero in the series is…very bad in the NBA playoffs.The Brooklyn Nets will be in the same situation as the Chicago bulls play your bench LaMarcus Aldridge should be playing the only with a post gameMy Phoenix Suns fan roommate just tried to claim Sirius by The Alan Parsons Project as the iconic Suns intro and I almost had to commit a murder #ChicagoBulls https://t.co/b6FueKbNgO🏀NBA🏀

Surely there is no way Chicago Bulls score less than 90 again tonight? And surely no way DeMar goes 6/25 again tonight? 

Am I talking myself into the DeMar over? 

Perhaps.
