We got a few disloyal Laker fans that are basically band wagon jumpers.@LakeShowScoop If only the Lakers could play the Golden State Warriors every game, only lost by 2 points the previous game.@Lakerscenters @RajChipalu Coach Vogel would not be able to do this if the GM had selected a 6‚Äô7/6‚Äô8 Big wing defender (under 30 years old).üò≠üò≠üò≠ Don‚Äôt forget that Pelinka used his last 15th roster spot on Golden State Warriors Avery Bradley.'GREEN IS THE CENTERPIECE of the Warriors' defense, a cornerstone of the teams that played in five straight Finals from 2015 to 2019.
