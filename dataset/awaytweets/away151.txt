 win vs the Rockets. Steph and Dray had a good full quarter of rest for tomorrow's game vs Trae Young and the Atlanta Hawks.@egoldie80 Emmett I 100% agree ! We are fun to watch! Kinda like last years Atlanta Hawks team11/7/07 – Steve Nash attempted to carry the Phoenix #Suns minus Amare Stoudemire, shooting 7-10 from 3, finishing w/34p/11a; however the Atlanta Hawks led for much of the final 3Q and held off PHX, 105-96. Marion: 20p/14r. Hill: 13p/9r. PHX won eight straight after. #ValleyProud https://t.co/czsUWiTAAy
