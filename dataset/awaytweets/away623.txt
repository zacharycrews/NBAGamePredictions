Well its @FredVanVleet 

@Raptors@LucasJrSantos @MLSEPR @ScotiabankArena @MapleLeafs @Raptors At this point credit to account. At the end of season if you call they will refund the money.So I hear we’re discussing a Poetl return to Toronto… Raptors get a low cost and solid C with a PG who can take the ball handling duties off of Fred off the bench while SA gets a pair of younger guys to throw into the rebuild + a pick. https://t.co/7Oa8UeHObl@LeoRautins @Matt__Devlin @KateBeirness @Kayla_Grey @KayNurse11 @TSN_Sports @Raptors @DetroitPistons @NBATVCanada Yippee!

But I’m guessing you’d only agree to this because you believe the Pacers want too much for Turner which is kinda apparent after the report that they wanted OG for Turner.The @Raptors are one of the @NBA's best offensive rebounding teams and have done so without sacrificing their transition defence.

How have they managed to do this? @BlakeMurphyODC takes a deeper look on the latest episode of the Fast Breakdown.

We switching up the topic now? We both know no ⭐️ is coming to Toronto as a free agent. New York at least has the potential to get that type of talent. That’s all I’m saying. 

I think Raptors have done an amazing job drafting/developing/trading. https://t.co/KwUm5Ot40LMyles Turner would look good in a Raptors uniform if you ask me.  Can spread the floor, protect the rim, and is a 25 year old 6'11 250lber who fits well with the age of the teams Core.

https://t.co/QRlpSxnl20Never bragged about it. It should be known the Knicks have the potential to be a big destination one day when they turn it around. 

I’m going at some of these Raptors fans who are comparing comparing Toronto to New York. It’s silly. https://t.co/kg1QSznuZC@ShamsCharania While the Toronto raptors still have no fans 😂It's like Bob cousy being the head coach of the Sacramento Kings profiling tiny Archibald, if Bob cousy wasn't the coach would tiny have led the NBA in scoring and assist?
