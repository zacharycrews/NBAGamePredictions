But trust me, my friend. 

It is not. 

God not gon honor that.@TheFirstMint @utahjazz @FirstBassMan

He absolutely deserves to be in the conversation at bare minimum. Let’s get this trending!#RUDYGOBERTNBAMVPhttps://t.co/EpNfnlsGxC

ICYMI -- While there isn't anybody in the @utahjazz organization who undervalues the high-scoring forward, @44Bojan may not get the respect he deserves from the rest of the league — but maybe that changes after what he did on Sunday night
#TakeNotehttps://t.co/Ucmh2MKqJt

ICYMI -- After missing two weeks, @rudygobert27 returned in a big way with his league-leading 32nd double-double of the season — helping lead a dominant defensive effort as the @utahjazz beat the @nuggets 125-102 on Sunday night
#TakeNote #NBAAllStarUTAH JAZZ- Horns Elbow PNR + Fake Pindown 🏀 📹  📝

1⃣ Start on a horns set
2⃣ Set a fake wide pindown to distract the weak side defender
3⃣ Play an elbow PNR with the paint wide open

https://t.co/49N5EMTly4@NatePhelps88 @NBA @utahjazz No, really it couldn't be. It's not that the Nuggets took too many fouls. It's that it is impossible that the Jazz only had four shooting fouls on 95 Nuggets shot attempts. That's just not really possible in an NBA game.@spdzlla @NBATV @utahjazz @Lakers how about that 500k lead?@scrawnyboiii @GagneMdx @NBA @utahjazz Right. So less than half. So in their other 52 attempts, you're telling me the Jazz fouled 4 times total. Sorry, that's just insane and not possible in an NBA game. It reminds me of the time Murray scored 50 on the Jazz and never got a single FT. Again, not possible. Terrible.NEXT IS ...✒️

[via r/utahjazz Jan 17, 2017 #Jazz]@cuboneXz @NBA @utahjazz @OfficialNBARefs I did watch the game lol. Jokic cried every time he was touched. And lost the game. Lol. 0-3 against the Jazz this year.Obnoxious Nuggets fan right behind me at the game shouting “Jordan Clarkson you suck!”   Me, sticking up for @JordanClarksons shouts the first thing that comes to my mind “Jordan, you do a great job! I’m proud of you buddy!”  #facepalm #utahjazz #jazznation@cuboneXz @NBA @utahjazz @OfficialNBARefs Show video@NBA @utahjazz Shows that Rudy has a bigger impact then Donovan great player but Rudy has the higher impact for the team@ryanspradlin @NBA @utahjazz So simple dude. Denver was on a b2b and tried to use same game plan as yesterday vs Lakers like jacking 3's. You not gonna get fouls from opponents if you shoot 3's?! Right? Instead go inside, drive to the hoop it's called penetrating and create fouls. Nuggets been tired,not JazzHey @Tjonesonthenba I hope you never leave the @utahjazz market for another team. You have been one of my favorite beat writers ever since you worked at the trib writing for @USUAthletics.@utahjazz @44Bojan How do you say travel in croatia?Great time watching @spidadmitchell and the @utahjazz dismantle the Nuggets in Denver tonight. LC's first @NBA game! We also found the limit of how much cotton candy is too much 🤣 https://t.co/6zq70pnLzj@GitaSuneja @huntsmancancer @UofURadOnc @Joeingles7 @utahjazz @5ForTheFight_ Let’s go!👏🏾🤩We know of the impact @rudygobert27 has on defense. How about the offensive impact he has on the court? Well…

Tonight when he was on the floor, the @utahjazz shot 57% and outscored DEN by 36 points!!!

With him off,  the Jazz shot 38% and were outscored by 13!

#TakeNote@NBA @utahjazz I'll just leave this one here. Where's Donaghy? Found him! This game was atrocious. https://t.co/6M13xtc1gP@utahjazz @pura And Rudy 1...it did go in 🤷‍♂️😏Nikola Jokić in three games against the Utah Jazz this year:

#donovanmitchell #utahjazz #nba https://t.co/T7WzeB9aLs https://t.co/v2NsKMDUPE@utahjazz Royce saying “Go Jazz” in a Junior Jazz player voice is just awesome.@Jhay_Efekt @Chiefs @utahjazz Absolutely none.  😂The data shows conclusively that Rudy Gobert is by far the best and most important player on the Utah Jazz. Far more important than Donovan Mitchell who the media treats like the main reason they’ve been good the last couple years

I think not.  @Chiefs and @utahjazz both took a W today. #TakeNote #ChiefsKingdom https://t.co/xDyiUG8gn1Here’s an honest-to-God question. How is it, that a team is as competitive as the @utahjazz are, year in and year out, when the league is literally set up for teams like them to fail. Nobody wants the Jazz to be good, yet here they are. Every. Damn. Season. https://t.co/6qTGJVs9mr@NickRhineer @utahjazz @44Bojan @Udo_LLC See me in the background! Let’s go!
