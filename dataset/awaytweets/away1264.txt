There are 450 guys in the NBA and they all have potential. That's why they made it that far. In the terms of the Golden State Warriors with KD in the 2020-21 season, Poole's potential was not helpful.

You can always find talent but seldom those other qualities . This is the same reason why not everyone fits at golden State. To play Warriors style you have to sacrifice, not everyone is willing to!@warriors I’m holling 🤣🤣💚🐍☝🏀💙💛🔥🔥🔥

The @warriors are going to win the 2022 NBA Championship!

@ScuderiaFerrari's @Charles_Leclerc will win the 2022 F1 season!

@Max33Verstappen will win the 2023 season!

@GeorgeRussell63 will win the 2024 season!

#BoldPredictionsI told days ago, #KevinDurant should never leave #goldenstatewarriors  now he is looking weak player and 2 weeks ago we was talking about he could be the best player now, not sure of that now @KendrickPerkins @RealSkipBayless #nba #Nets #Celtics@thejolson That thousand yard stare of Durant brings such warmness to my heart. He's got that "damn, I had it good in Golden State" look.

No matter what, Curry will always have one more ring, and the way they're playing, it might end up being two rings over KD.

Celts/Warriors sound great.@KDTrey5 you miss playing with the @warriors  yet ? Lmao@bezy_bby I'm sure they could have found a way to make that work... Durant left on his own... Golden State wanted him to stay... they loved KD... still do #Warriors #BOSvsBKN #NBAPlayoffsIf Boston and Warriors go to the finals . Me and Mom’s will be at the game. She love Golden State.@warriors Yessir! Let’s go goatsThis is why I respect what @warriors did.

Only 2 teams have *not* won a single game in the playoffs. 

Nuggets (vs. @warriors) 
Nets (vs. @celtics) 

Also, KD and Kyrie left the Celtics and the Warriors (at their teams' lowest) to the Nets, while the teams they ditched built from the ground up. https://t.co/6kn5vG5wb1I wonder if Kevin Durant is regretting leaving the #Warriors for the #Nets yet. Had Curry, but went to Irving and, briefly, a reunion with Harden. I loved KD helping win titles with Golden State, but some people never fully accepted him. He still left the best thing he ever had.@AbeBatshon @celtics @warriors They are looking really tough. Super confident too.- Kevin Durant leaving the @warriors to play for this @BrooklynNets team must be one of the biggest downgrades in NBA history.@KendrickPerkins The media plays a big role in gassing up those two/duo to a fault. They both ain’t that good- Kyrie was riding on @KingJames back, just like the splash brothers @warriors made KD shine… Carry the hell on‼️Without the @warriors its imposible,come back @KDTrey5KD left The Warriors cause Golden State fans didn’t show him as much love as a player that got drafted and grew with the fanbase…Ego is a hell of a bitch.@celtics and @warriors in the finals this year.  Tatum is a top 10 player in the NBA.@warriors Go crazy Warriors fans https://t.co/c20Yo6LoYZ@mspears96 @KendrickPerkins Now we see why @KDTrey5 went to the 73-9 @warriors to play &amp; win championships. Pressure busts pipes. He’s not bout that life. KD will ALWAYS be Lebron’s son. #Not👑💩@CurrysLeague @EskoN8tiveAK @warriors @TISSOT Hey you got the next game to win ,it’s not the referee. Curry and Klay choke big time !! History is make ☄️💥☄️ end of story!! Suspending games it’s part of basketball games 🤷🏻‍♀️ Even now Green still fighting with the referee and getting technical foul!!, let’s see what he does now@KDTrey5 is a great scorer....not a great leader, and it's really worsening his championships with @warriors as their making a run to go back to the finals without him, I don't want to hear him ever brought up as best player ever!!!!TOP, MIDDLE &amp; BOTTOM LINE : "@KDTrey5" SOLD ASS N HAS BEEN SELLING ASS THE WHOLE SERIES VERSUS THE @celtics. He SHOULD HAVE KEPT His PEEZY HEAD ASS with the @Warriors. TOO LATE NOW. The @BrooklynNets ARE the @nyknicks in Brooklyn. AND, "@BenSimmons25" IS SOFT, SCARY &amp; A BUM. @NBA@DogSurfRoadshow @warriors @Patty_Mills @Goran_Dragic Gotta love the Ted Lasso reply haha@lleung @celtics @celtics look good. Will be fun to watch them vs @warriorsKevin Durant owes the Golden State Warriors a HELLUVA apology.@DrGuru_ Well it goes to show he only got those rings cause he was with the  @warriors@RealSkipBayless @KingJames still made finals with a bunch of role players. It took @KDTrey5 @Money23Green @KlayThompson and the heart of @warriors, the man @StephenCurry30 to beat himThis comment would be unfathomable in 2021, but I don’t think the @warriors would trade Jordan Poole for KD in 2022.@BrooklynNets are done.. Even with two 1on1 beasts in KD and Kyrie the @celtics D has bottled them up.. And the Nets with no D themselves, this series is over.. Sad to say.. KD now missing those @warriors teammates..@nbatopshot @celtics If @Bucks can't do it then the @warriors can.@NBA @celtics @BrooklynNets KD cannot win without @warriorsTo you all (most especially @RealSkipBayless ) who made 2017 n 18 @warriors RINGs abt @KDTrey5, need to shut the h** up and give @StephenCurry30 the full respect he deserves. ✌️ @NBATV @NBAonTNT @stephenasmith @Euphoria_Sticks🏀 NBA Playoffs - Sports Bar Madrid

You left  Curry for Irving now it’s looking like you regret dat 🤔 #warriors@noahbandzzz3 @NBA2K @warriors @nuggets U madKD could be on the Warriors right now with Steph Curry, Klay Thompson, Draymond Green, and Jordan Poole, but instead chose to go to Brooklyn and play with Kyrie and a mediocre HC. 

He should’ve never left Golden State, but he couldn’t stand not being the definitive number 1@JpBurnUp12 @NBA2K @warriors @nuggets If  it’s ass stop playin it@warriors we need more of this....
@Money23Green vs @KlayThompson@KendrickPerkins @stephenasmith I hate to tweet this but @KendrickPerkins you were absolutely correct and your word choice was spot on. But it wasn’t as harsh as what @stephenasmith was saying when KD joined the @warriors .@MemphisFanManny @antbomb @_901Ja @warriors @statmuse I’m honestly so happy you think I’m that young that I’m just going to let everything else slide and call it a day. 😂

I honestly don’t know the ages of people who post on here.@nbatopshot @celtics Waaarrrrrrriors @warriors@DogSurfRoadshow @warriors @Patty_Mills @Goran_Dragic Honestly glad we didn’t get either of them now because they would’ve just taken minutes away from Poole@sportszone30 @KendrickPerkins @RealSkipBayless tried to credit him for all of the championship runs Golden State had as if he single handedly carried them on his back &amp; won on his own. Clearly it was much easier for KD with the other Warriors stars. He’ll never admit it but him banking on Kyrie was a mistake.@DogSurfRoadshow @antbomb @_901Ja @warriors @statmuse not doing research but talking shit over a teen being an adult on you off days over a shit team is some crazy dick eating from your part 😂 mad for no reason u literally like 30 😭KD without the Golden State warriors https://t.co/8FTpMuvF4V@steph_burner @BleacherReport Yep, KD had a good thing with @warriors splash bros. Too bad for him the vision wasn’t there. Jordan Poole certainly has done well for team and himself. Now there are three splash bros and what’s KD got?Durant should of stayed in Golden State... the grass was greener over there #Warriors #BOSvsBKN #NBAPlayoffsi been telling people for longtime that KD will not be better then Lebron james. i love KD n Lebron. lets get this straight here now. KD went to warriors and won both in Golden state . Lebron won his titles in miami n back to Cleveland that he promise his fans.@NBA @espn We can all agree @KDTrey5 got overrated a bit once he won with @warriors @StephenCurry30 @KlayThompson @Money23Green The @okcthunder has resurfaced again.

Many will wonder if he only became a champion because he joined the Warriors. Side Note: he made a terrible mistake leaving Golden State!!!Kevin Durant left the GOLDEN STATE WARRIORS to get swept in the first round 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭I personally would’ve taken him with the #1 pick. He’s a perfect fit for this @warriors dynasty. https://t.co/ynBzgv6pUV@DogSurfRoadshow @warriors @Patty_Mills @Goran_Dragic Agree 100%@KingJosiah54 @ZiMa1982 @wsiddi1 me when the @warriors win this yearThe #Nets were a goof all season long - why are people shocked by this??   #goldenstatewarriors are clearly the only team capable of flipping the switch and turning it on.  It’s over in Brooklyn and over for Brooklyn. #BKNvsBOS #NBAPlayoffsThose @celtics look like a championship team. I’d love to see my @warriors play them in the finalsNever went down 3-0 with @StephenCurry30 &amp; the @warriors 🤷🏻‍♂️. @KDTrey5see u in the finals @warriorsThe @warriors wanted @Patty_Mills and they wanted @Goran_Dragic but both those guys stupidly chose the Nats and are now simply getting what they asked for. 😂@warriors Bro😂😂😂 you lucky you my manz steph !🤦🏾‍♂️CELTICS WON AGAIN.....

It seems as if the media and fans not respecting his rings with Warriors made him want to try to win one somewhere else. 

Just my opinion..@ErnestInc1of1 I think bucks will meat the heat at the conference finals , but that’s my opinion . All I want is for my golden state warriors to win@blktrubian @AllAccessNYKNYM @BleacherReport @NBCSAuthentic @warriors The anon troll is correct despite their Swiss cheese logic. 😂 Steph’s team had the best record his two MVP years and you reply with “Huh?” I don’t respect Jokic’s MVP #2 nor do I respect westbrick and the chubby flopper’s MVPs because they don’t do shit when it counts the most. https://t.co/8ZoSzBFqyo@warriors Joker bouta get sweptShould’ve stayed on the @warriors @KDTrey5Kevin Durant leaving the Golden State Warriors was a horrific mistake...I wouldn't say this.

I'm sure you had lots of time to think up comments like this when @memgrizz knocked the @warriors out of the play-in last year.  At GS, I might add.  lolIt's amazing what the Golden State Warriors have done this single season alone. We saw a top prospect turn from bust to all star, we saw a player miss 941 days of action come back to his peak form, we saw the rise of a player on his way out the league into a ⭐ calibre. Amazing✨@Cutthroatcutty @Warriors_Guru @warriors Lil boy, your idea of wealth is talking about what your parents have or gave you lmao I'm self made. U living off charity from others n even worse u still think the dubs a dynasty.

I mean honestly it’s far from rocket science@hornetsXO @DesignzRUs @DrGuru_ As you can see it’s easier to play when you are in golden state look at Jordan Poole.

But the Warriors know that now isn’t the time to get complacent.
