Mitch/Garland provide playmaking, need to spread playmaking out across lineups. Levert felt like a good 6th man option with Okoro/Wade being better options at starting 3 IMO but I guess it’ll work itself out@cavs @spidadmitchell Lets go cavsIn his first pregame chat of the new season with @CavsJMike, J.B.

N with this squad @cavs winn in it 7!Go @cavs the league isn't ready for Mobley's second yearOnly Cavs fan in the building, but who cares, I got a free t-shirt? @cavs https://t.co/uTPaCGgckI@cavs @firstenergycorp Let's go@DarkMagician04 @findgg33 @LAClippers @warriors @celtics @Bucks @Suns @BrooklynNets @cavs @dallasmavs And also agree no PG is being the best player in a championship team that’s not Steph as the best 3 point shooter ever and warriors front office building the team. The Cavs are extremely deep that’s what I think helps them but not winning anything currentlyLeader. Calming presence. Scoring threat.

@spidadmitchell reflects on what he brings to this @cavs team.

#LetEmKnow https://t.co/ya8UPjcFBH@RatWolverine @findgg33 @LAClippers @warriors @celtics @Bucks @Suns @BrooklynNets @cavs @dallasmavs A lot depends on garland and how he plays but on the outlook seems like he will get abused on defense , and herb jones would lock him up id wager. Cavs are good but they don’t have a Zion or Ingram level get you 25 and guard the other teams best player. Mobley most promising@CleGuardians @cavs The two good cleveland teams@cavs @CleGuardians yo chill w that@cavs @firstenergycorp Should be K Love starting.

Was surprised to see Garland avg’d 8 assists a game last year but Donovan Mitchell is definitely not a PG yup@BallySportsCLE @cavs @cayleighgriffin @MikeFratello @CampyRussell For $20 a month on a garbage app. Good grief.@cavsdan @cavs Yessir!@RatWolverine @findgg33 @LAClippers @warriors @celtics @Bucks @Suns @BrooklynNets @cavs @dallasmavs Who’s the best player on the cavs? Who was the last Pg to win a chip as the best player of their team other than steph (generational talent).. Chauncey billups?@cavsdan @cavs Let's get it! Best owner in NBACavs season opener let’s go @cavs #LetEmKnowFirst game of the @cavs season and another year of complete incompetence from the @BallySportsCLE app. A tradition like no other.Ah yes, the Cleveland CavaliersThe sad news is that the @CleGuardians ended their season last night. The happy news is that the @cavs open their season tonight. #LetEmKnow@RatWolverine @findgg33 @LAClippers @warriors @celtics @Bucks @Suns @BrooklynNets @cavs @dallasmavs I could revise my statement to say the pelicans big three is better than the cavs if it makes you feel better. I actually like garland and Allen. Mitchell is not taking those guys over the top though.@cavsdan @cavs Thank you again for the 2016 championship 🏆 . Good luck this upcoming season.@BallySportsCLE @CarisLeVert @cavs @SerenaWinters Never mind it's on 660 but not 661.Thank you to the @CleGuardians for a wonderful season, but it’s time to look forward as the @cavs open their season in Toronto as they take on the Raptors!

#LetEmKnow https://t.co/4uiAjiRFhr@SNBets @Raptors @cavs Scottie Barnes 15+pts@cavs @firstenergycorp Okoro coming off the bench might be tough 👀@RatWolverine @findgg33 @LAClippers @warriors @celtics @Bucks @Suns @BrooklynNets @cavs @dallasmavs I’d wager hes more valuable than d Mitchell or garland in being a Pg that can run the offense with players better than him. Mitchell is a ball stopper and has an incredible usage 

Steph curry is the only Pg in the league who’s winning a chip as the best player of the franchise.I agree, go @cavs #LetEmKnow@DrinkBODYARMOR Michael Jordan no doubt.

I hope next year we can go all the way!@1BigWobbz @cavs Me nigga@jacecraftmiller @CleGuardians @cavs Following a MLB team in a playoff race and then into the playoffs is so much fun. Savor those memories. The @tigers have been dormant for 8 years and counting.Who starting today? @cavsHappy birthday to Lonnie Shelton of the Seattle SuperSonics #lonnieshelton #lonniejewelshelton #seattlesupersonics #newyorkknicks #clevelandcavaliers #nbaallstar https://t.co/NY7JoP9d9u@JMW96___ @bodieondacorner @NickCaminoWKYC @KingJames @cavs His son will not be a lottery pick in my estimation. I don’t think teams are throwing away top 10 picks for Lebron year 22 and 23.On today's show:
- Recapping the #Guardians G5 loss in New York
- Celebrating what an amazing season this was for such a young squad
- @BigMouthLeroy on all things #Browns
- FULL @cavs season preview w/ No Fence Riders
https://t.co/DOUgfbM1XY@JMW96___ @GBasch @NickCaminoWKYC @KingJames @cavs Bronny won’t be a top 5 pick cmon man.@bodieondacorner @GBasch @NickCaminoWKYC @KingJames @cavs Unless that draft pick is 1-5, Cavs won’t have a chance to get him before another team get him. Just give it up brah, Lebron era with the Cavs is over. It was a great run and he’ll always be a legend/champion here, but we don’t need him anymore. Cavs have a new identity nowCleveland Cavaliers play NBA Basketball today!!!!@GBasch @JMW96___ @NickCaminoWKYC @KingJames @cavs Cavs still have their 2024 draft pick.Had a lot of fun with expert @TorDawg69 and Ambassador @SwaGGy_D33 .

Some conflicting opinions on Minnesota Timberwolves and Cleveland Cavaliers. How far do we have #FearTheDeer and Giannis? Is this Luka Doncic's or the Clippers year? So much to talk about, so little time! https://t.co/rBFbJWBXW3From @MRidenourABJ on end of @CleGuardians  season and start of @cavs campaign.

Time to cut the Cleveland Browns cord, choose joy of Cavaliers, Guardians https://t.co/9dCtFVZQkF via @beaconjournal@PeteMarek @CleGuardians @cavs Miss that song on WUAB before the gamesGood morning and happy opening day your @Cavs, CLEVELAND!!!!!!!thankful the @cavs season starts today because with the guardians season over i can't bare the thought of only having the browns to watch@JMW96___ @bodieondacorner @NickCaminoWKYC @KingJames @cavs I don’t think he’s ever coming back, but his kid might be going to college and also might not be an NBA prospect (ie you might not need draft capital to get him)Good Morning @cavs fans!!! #LetEmKnow https://t.co/fatoTH09C4After an absolutely shitastic start to the Browns season, we finally get some good news:

Ladies and Gentlemen, the Cleveland Cavaliers. https://t.co/vsUClqPN9I@bodieondacorner @GBasch @NickCaminoWKYC @KingJames @cavs He’s actually going wherever is son get drafted to. Cavs gave away all of their draft assets for Mitchell. So I doubt he’ll ever be in a Cavs uniform, unless he sign a contract just to retire his jerseythank you for a great season @CleGuardians 

Thankful basketball season has started 🙏 Go @cavs@bodieondacorner @JMW96___ @NickCaminoWKYC @KingJames @cavs He just signed an extension.

Over / under wins for Lakers is 44.5. Borrow as much money as you can and slam the under!@drivefumble @cavs Levert chill@EconomPic @therealyoon @Lakers @cavs I don’t take anything away from what the Lakers will be in a game like this. I think everyone with a basketball sense knew this would be a laugher.@EconomPic @therealyoon @Lakers @cavs 1st half was competitive with LA shooting like 0% from 3. It’s all 3rd quarter where things got nasty.@TheFlightMike Don’t worry, @KingJames doesn’t stay &amp; try to make teams good

He is ready to go back to @cavs since they have a good team now.
Then he will take credit for them winning a title AGAIN. Im sure your @Lakers will get something good in return for him.

Trade @AntDavis23 to the @trailblazers and just start over from scratch. Oh and 🗣️FIRE ROB! 😂😂😂@SJD10304 @therealyoon @Lakers @cavs This is the worst team defense I’ve seen by an NBA team in a while.

OVER 47.5 Wins. The future looks bright in Cleveland. A LeBron return in 2024?

Worst: Lose in the play-in and we start to have serious questions about their future without picks https://t.co/Ye7KN3cM4t@utdrobbo @cavs why would isaiah mobley start with the starters lol@cavs Can you clear a spot for Josh Naylor?So proud of the @CleGuardians, but their elimination still hurts!!
