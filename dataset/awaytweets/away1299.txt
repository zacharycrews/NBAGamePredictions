@KendrickPerkins 👀 https://t.co/Mf2aERxBO7There’s a vibe out there that both home teams will win and these spreads are low enough that each game is essentially a pick em. I’ll roll with Miami cause I do have faith. I will say if you like teaser play, tease up Dallas. It’ll be close. But for me…

https://t.co/ndfvWP5N81 https://t.co/MulthLH1UrMiami Heat you have 1 job please close out Philly tonight 🙏🏾If @MiamiHEAT wants to play zone 
I’d sit Embiids right on the high post and force them to double team 
It’s gonna be hard to work off the low block in a zone
That’s why Harden attacking early
Maxey attacking &amp; Tobias getting to his mid range spots is key

@WaterCleanupFLHow is #miamiheat  offensive efficiency better than the #76ers right now in this series o yea. Defense wins championships  #NBAPlayoffs  #FirstTake #NBAonTNT     #Game6 #Heatvs76ersCalling it rn…. Miami Heat win this game on a buzzer beater by Jimmy Butler 👀 🤫One key for the Sixers to get a win today in Game 6 is playing faster. If Miami is picking up full court, let Maxey bring the ball up instead of Harden. When the Heat are in a zone, the Sixers aren’t getting into their offense until there’s roughly 14 seconds on the shot clock.@Fadewade @MiamiHEAT Prayer circle :

From our research the safe pick would be the Under (207).However the family is siding with the Heat money line +110 as Miami looks to close the series in Philadelphia. I know you'll make the right decision gagootz. #nba #playoffsObviously, the early-season games are a smaller sample size. But I'd take my chances earlier in the season rather than going from New England winter to Miami heat.Week 1: Patriots at Dolphins 1PM

📝Harden Double double NO @ 1.83  1u bet365

Like this bet, Miami is mostly staying home on shooters when Harden is driving and havent gotten 10 reb in the playoffs so far. Gone 0/5 vs Heat.I like to think that when will Smith said "Bouncin' in the club where the heat is on", he was actually referring to Mercedes' porpoising issues in the Miami street circuit.

The Miami Heat Play Basketball Today@MiamiHEAT win lead series 3-2 https://t.co/aDfFGeURWL@MiamiHEAT go out there and play like y’all gotta brain. Okay?@Johnvgoated Mans forgot 2015 warriors so called frauds with a home grown Team won lmaoooo. But a superstar Miami heat team in the 2010’s not a fraud at all. Are we forgetting your goat begging curry to join him cause he can’t carry teams no more and has to whine and dine superstarsWould it be fair to compare Max Strus to Desmond Bane? They both play similar roles on their respective teams  @MiamiHEAT @memgrizz @SSN_GrizzliesDec. 17, 1991, 30 years old, 5th year on Cavs beat, seated courtside for 148-80 win over Miami Heat at Richfield Coliseum! GSW-Memphis brought back some memories!!!!HEAT fans are talking about Donavan Mitchell and the arena isn’t full when here we are 1 game for the ECF. Now is not the time to talk about breaking up a title contending team who has a chance to win it all ! Donovan is a Jazz Miami is 5 games from finals. Pack the arena andPlease take care of business tomorrow @MiamiHEAT this championship is up for grabs like never before.@LegionHoops There was a serious talk also of Demar Derozan Coming to @MiamiHEAT when the Lowry talks heated up. And he had an amazing season for the bulls decision decisionI need to see Miami heat in the finals@FlyByKnite Should be 3-2, Heat were up double digits in game 3 against Atlanta before Lowry got hurt, if healthy Lowry is massive for this team, but I will say Miami wins game 4 if Lowry sat out once he got reinjuredThat’s crazy because neither of them are getting past the Miami Heat https://t.co/Cu3jsISZDrmy homegirl when i spam her tl with miami heat tweets https://t.co/ZTDC8ojVJ4Heat gonna 60 ball in Miami 😭😭😭 https://t.co/heVWs3EwGq46 pt blowout and Miami Heat legend Andre Iguodala can't get minutes smhI need Poole &amp; Herro cookin together.

Struggling with a Philly team with garbage Harden and injured Embiid. I think either Boston or Milwaukee beats them.Don’t embarrass me on TV like this @MiamiHEATThanks for never embarrassing me like this in the playoffs @MiamiHEATI don’t think a team who can get beat this badly can win it all…

I got the Miami Heat winning the title nowHow you up 3-1 in a series getting beat by 50 @warriors @MiamiHEAT would never.@Kenny16Techs Because them fans doesn't know shit and they are casual fans not real fans because they doesn't know that Duncan Robinson lead the team in 3s and 3 points percent. He was the one of the reasons that the Miami Heat is first in the conference when Jimmy and Bam was out@thejalen_smith The Miami Heat might be a great fitTomorrow my boys @MiamiHEAT Turn finish LFG!!! 🏀🌴@NonchDaDon @5ReasonsSports This is the best chance the miami heat has had for a championship in a while same with panthers they both gotta have it, we all need it@MiamiHEAT I once heard of a guy being ruled out and then playing@MiamiHEAT Finish it.@JOSE97LUIS @FlaPanthers @SociosUSA @MiamiHEAT I love this. Make it a thing.Bucks, both teams aren’t deep and the heat being the deepest team in the league creates problems for both. Ultimately the it’s unlikely to beat Miami with 1 guy and Giannis generally performs well below his own standards against the Heat. I’d rather play Giannis than JT and JB. https://t.co/eEYPNmAeymIt’s there for the taking @MiamiHEAT@thejpyoung @SmileFuk @running_to_win @vince_fraumeni @adamiami_ @MiamiHEAT @Bucks Make that a five guys meal ‘cause we’re going to witness Jimmy’s redemption arcMiami Heat have DJ Khaled but Panthers have Kodak@MiamiHEAT Yall come on and win game 6.

He is allowed to bring Ernie again but this time not as contraband to the next game@halfcourtheat @Bucks @NBAonTNT You watch those 2 teams going at each other right now and it’s pretty clear ain’t no Miami heat or the sixers beating those teams.I guess Coach Spolestra and the Miami Heat defense is going to have to show everyone how to play defense on Giannis. Giannis vs Heat this season 19ppg on 17/44 FG (38%)@rn1obab @MiamiHEAT Sleep is overrated. Watch your team@ASKamara I love giannis o....but I'm sensing a miami heat GS final....based on experience and overall quality of players....@scottler424 @KyleNeubeck I never wanted them to play the heat..they always have our number..they play us so well..I still thinkin Miami will close it out game 7Milwaukee Bucks vs Miami Heat in the Eastern Conference Finals is gonna be insane@spidadmitchell Wellcome to @MiamiHEAT@haralabob Nah. Miami could beat the Bucks.I’d say the Heat are favored  without Middleton and GS vs Phoenix will be stellar. Assuming health the winner of that series wins the 🏆.  Boston is super lucky Middleton is out bc if not Bucks would have won in 5.@bubblefraud @MiamiHEAT doesn’t prove anything btw@bamfuckingsucks @MiamiHEAT IM NOT A JINX????The Miami Heat and Milwaukee Bucks are one win each away from meeting in the NBA Playoffs for the third consecutive season. https://t.co/mt69rJFnkOI just published Top 10 Miami Heat https://t.co/LoazSAlj3rThe #Sixers' enemy is among us.

got nba money im mvp@MiamiHEAT  💪 looking to take game 6 https://t.co/goAU1PP1pu@_iGrizz @burtfurnace @BGN_5 I’d have to give a fuck about the heat to come up with excuses for ya’ll. I’m just stating facts. You’re trying to claim Miami’s audience is formidable because they show up…eventually. Traffic is a pathetic excuse. You don’t have clocks and cell phones in FL?@LaPerki82 @undisputed @ShannonSharpe Ohh ye, u really a tough man with that Miami Heat pfp right?If the Celtics meet the heat in the next round fuck it we to Miami next weekend@flex_meta @MiamiHEAT 🔥🔥🔥
Why just the Conference Finals, my son would be too happy if it were the Finals, and I’m not telling you if it’s going to the titleThe Miami Heat play in the @FTXArena , Los Angeles Lakers and Clippers in the @cryptocomarena.   Crypto ads durning MLB games…. mass adoption is coming.The Miami Heat and the Phoenix Suns are one win away from qualifying for the Eastern and Western finals of the NBA, respectively, with the first victory over the Philadelphia 76ers 120-85 and the second over the Dallas Mavericks 110-80.

(via @SInow) https://t.co/kuo6kEXkQ6@MiamiHEAT Please don't blow this Miami 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏@TheNBACentral @JakeLFischer Mitchell needs to regain that gritty defensive edge he came into the league with. He used to be a decent two-way player but has really fallen off on defense the last couple seasons. I could see how being around Jimmy Butler and “Miami Heat culture” would be beneficial for him.“The heat have one of the worst fans in the league, it’s not an advantage when Miami plays at home” suck my left nut @MadDogUnleashed https://t.co/kIkeXkKhO5If the bucks lose Miami heat to the finals let’s goYou put it down like New York City, I never sleep 😮‍💨
