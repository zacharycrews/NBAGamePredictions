https://t.co/T29wz2Mq6f@craftsportscast @MeloDip11 @hornets Short version: Their sh*t ain‚Äôt Chattanooga üòÇ@hornets A for sure. I like the city jerseys alright this year. Purple needs to have the old school pinstripes instead of the solid purple.@HoopsRandom @RobbieClayton78 @hornets @Bobcats2k14 Thats whats we do on Throwback Hoops @HoopsRandom üòÇI guess it was ok that you almost beat me in your driveway as a pre- teen when I played for @hornets. üòÇ. Congrats @StephenCurry30 https://t.co/suIU5sKIx3@HornetsPR @hornets Jordan better put Melo on a private jet.Class act. Kemba is a great player in a wrong team and I sure hope the Knicks do right by him by trading him somewhere his talents are needed. @hornets why don't you take your son back?? https://t.co/q3K7L8oCfN@greensboroswarm @hornets Damn his stats bout to look like Wilt@23XIRacing @BubbaWallace @wheaties @hornets When we getting a @Hornets, @Panthers, @Canes, @GoHeels scheme? ü§îü§îü§î@Raptors @wacchi1013 Y‚Äôall see that cut? @Pacers @celtics @memgrizz @warriors @trailblazers @sixers @dmorey @Lakers @MiamiHEAT @hornets @SacramentoKings @utahjazzWes Bryant (@WesGotRange) joined @KyleBaileyClub today on the @ClubhouseKB as he looked at what the @hornets can learn from the loss to the Mavericks, and if Duke made the right move in Mike Elko.

@ashahahmadi  @hornets

AWESOME MOMENT for Dad &amp; Son. ‚ù§Ô∏è
Congratulations @StephenCurry30I grew up lucky enough to have @hornets season tickets and was the biggest Dell Curry fan (no offense @RexChapman). This is just awesome. https://t.co/KazIHEV5zhDell Curry, Steph Curry‚Äôs dad, pitched in HS &amp; college at Virginia Tech, &amp; was selected in the MLB Draft twice. In 1991, Dell started a game for the Class A Gastonia Rangers, pitching 3 innings. Muggsey Bogues, his Charlotte Hornets teammate, started that game at 2BAs much as he‚Äôs beaten us over the years it‚Äôs hard for Charlotte fans to hate this guy he‚Äôs the hometown kid the best shooter of all time and he grew up in the hornets locker room and sitting court side watching his pops love ya @StephenCurry30 please be a hornet for like 1 year https://t.co/Km0kq4NTos#StephCurry #GOAT #CCS #DavidsonCollege as Charlotte native i watched Dell w/ #Hornets. Steph is amazing to watch. https://t.co/9Gdc2PWgJNJust a reminder on this historic night that Steph Curry and I were homies when we were 2 and both our dads played for the Charlotte Hornets.

Did my mindless toddler babbling help him discover his form? Maybe, maybe not. We‚Äôll never know either way.
