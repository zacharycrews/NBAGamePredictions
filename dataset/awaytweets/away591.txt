Jordan is the second-fastest player in NBA history to reach that mark (460 games), trailing only Wilt Chamberlain (358). https://t.co/MhvLCZ1VXLYo the fact that @ZachLaVine is shooting 50% from the field 41% from 3 point this season while shooting over 50% from the field and 3point over the last 10 games.

Too many playing time question marks in the NFL today. Keeping things simple. Bulls are better than the Mavericks. They're relatively rested. 2.5 point spread is too small.
