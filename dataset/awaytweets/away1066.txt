#BleedGreen  #MileHighBasketball https://t.co/AaFs7stLqcLFGGGG my good pals @celticsMade BBQ ribs and potato salad for dinner. Came home to turn on the @celtics pre-show, to find them replaying clips of the playoff finals in ’87 against the Pistons. This made my heart so happy. I remember that game fondly.The Curtis Rowe/Sidney Wicks era of the Boston Celtics is definitely not looked at fondly by longtime Celtics fans......Larry Bird coming in was like Jesus at that time https://t.co/cJyTlDtZ9B@celtics Keep him outThis game against @nuggets is a huge test for this #Celtics team.  

A win tonight and you have to start considering the @celtics a favorite to come out of the East.
