All of those teams have multiple big men

And they thrive against team like Phoenix, Charlotte, etc because they have less big men.

It's not a coincidence lol. Playoffs are about matchupsMost PTS during 1 GP in Miami #Heat history: 
1. 2014 LeBron James (61)
2. 1995 Glen Rice (56)
3. 2009 Dwyane Wade (55)

Because you know, this is about how the Heat match up with Milwaukee?March 3, 2014: Miami #Heat SF Lebron James scored a career-high and franchise-record 61 points in a victory over the Charlotte Hornets while wearing a black mask over his face (for injury purposes). LBJ's 61 PTS still stands as the franchise record https://t.co/7fLuvIPN4P@sebskiiiii @TyherroStan @buks_chitown @BMACK_3 @MiamiHEAT He cannot score on Brook Lopez because there is not a good natural Center on the Miami Heat.

Bam is a natural PF. He's going to struggle against bigger matchups unless Butler finds a jumper (won't happen) or you find a legit 7 footer@leonhartkevin29 @Titan_Cane I'm just trying to figure out how to get Miami Heat tweets off my timeline.@Miamisportsfre1 @TCIIIESQ @MiamiHEAT @NBA Heat fans can never complain about fouls.@MiamiHEAT @FTX_Official In the last 7 games, Jimmy is shooting 39-111 üò¨üò¨ 4 of those games he's scored 15 or less.   Also 4 or less assist in 9 of 10 games.@sebskiiiii @TyherroStan @buks_chitown @BMACK_3 @MiamiHEAT Bam: 15.5, 9 boards on 45% shootingüò≠

Brook: 15.8, 4 boards on 60% shooting

Your team has no size for Brook lol, and you're going to continue to struggle against bigger teams until you find actual size

It's not a coincidence that Toronto wiped you twice in a rowSo according to #HeatTwitter logic, the Bucks getting blown out by Cleveland, fully healthy, not  once but twice, is better than @MiamiHEAT losing by a point last night. Yeah where do Miami find these fans.@sebskiiiii @TyherroStan @buks_chitown @BMACK_3 @MiamiHEAT How much Bam average against Brook? What were his splits?

After losing in a nailbiter, Miami is back, against another Eastern Conference favourite. Butler and co are 5-0-1 ATS in their last 6 on the road. Mills and co are 6-21-1 ATS at home. I know it's a 2 games in 2 days for Miami but 3.5 points is a steal.

Totally blown games by poor decisions in the final minutess@asimancas305 @MiamiHEAT They clearly blew a 10 point lead with 3 minutes left in the game and couldn't execute an inbounds play, if that happens you deserve to lose, pretty sure anyone would agree with me lol@TyherroStan @MiamiHEAT I‚Äôm sick right now@Macgyver1312 @WadexFlash @MiamiHEAT Swept if Harden and Kyrie was healthy lol@MiamiHEAT I m sooo mad now, how about Tyler Herro's turnover?ü§¨@MkeJax @MiamiHEAT The play where Giannes and Jimmy went for the loose ball, Giannes clearly fouled him by rule.

#HEATCulture https://t.co/Ahago9QR5W@MiamiHEAT @DoorDash The Bucks are a very good rebounding/shooting team who is one of the best in the league scoring off TOV and play with a top 5 pace in the NBA vs Miami's #28

Miami must limit the TOV / PF ~12/~17 , rebound well, and most importantly slow the game down to their paceAre we the best team in the East or the second place???  #miamiheat https://t.co/MhwYDPsJfr@MiamiHEAT @DoorDash Let‚Äôs Go!!! üî•üî•üî•@MiamiQueen2 @MiamiHEAT @DoorDash We‚Äôre underdogs tonight..i don‚Äôt expect much esp.when Key players start acting upJust bought tickets for my first @MiamiHEAT game üòÅ.

Against the Heat, he‚Äôs almost always spending the entire first quarter passing because of the way Miami defends him. But I think Giannis can and should physically overpower the defense and set the tone.TONIGHT on NBA League Pass at 8pm/et the #1 in the East Miami Heat seek their 5th straight win as they visit #4 in the East Milwaukee Bucks.
