Even with restricted minutes, this is a super low PRA for Durant. Averages 42.5 PRA this season. If he plays 25-30 minutes tonight, we should cash💰.

Butler was off all night. Should’ve never put the ball in his hands that last play. We had that game won until he stepped back on the court…should’ve let the bench close out the game they were the reason we were on top until the last 5 minutes of the gameThe Heat and Bulls have been at the top of the East all season...but the Philly, Milwaukee and Brooklyn are getting more love🤔

And Giannis and Khris were on restricted minutes.

And then you lost the next game against us with Lowry.

And we didn't have Giannis.@sebskiiiii @TyherroStan @buks_chitown @BMACK_3 @MiamiHEAT Not against big teams lol@sebskiiiii @TyherroStan @buks_chitown @BMACK_3 @MiamiHEAT I just said that you guys play well against teams like Phoenix.

Also, they only have a 12-15 record against teams above .500 this season and still are the 4 seed in the Eastern Conference. Wow.@itsmripp @russdeceased @Play_4_Keeps_A1 @kobebulikk @filippp9_ @MiamiHEAT At least u got self awareness bro, hope u can overcome that disability someday! But seriously I recommend u stop crying bro.@sebskiiiii @TyherroStan @buks_chitown @BMACK_3 @MiamiHEAT The healthiest both teams have been, you lost while shooting 50% from 3 lol

If the 3s don't fall Miami can't win@AJ_SMG @MiamiHEAT All I’m saying is they better keep this same energy when we win the 🏆@sebskiiiii @TyherroStan @buks_chitown @BMACK_3 @MiamiHEAT Miami has struggled vs. Cavs, Toronto, Milwaukee, Boston

All of those teams have multiple big men

And they thrive against team like Phoenix, Charlotte, etc because they have less big men.

It's not a coincidence lol. Playoffs are about matchupsMost PTS during 1 GP in Miami #Heat history: 
1. 2014 LeBron James (61)
2. 1995 Glen Rice (56)
3. 2009 Dwyane Wade (55)
4. 2011 LeBron James (51)
T5. 2009 Dwyane Wade 2x, 1996 Alonzo Mourning (50) https://t.co/eJNMxRZCwR@MichaelAllone @KDTrey5 @MiamiHEAT That’s a fire edit 😂😂@sebskiiiii @TyherroStan @buks_chitown @BMACK_3 @MiamiHEAT I'm talking about the 4-0 series.

Because you know, this is about how the Heat match up with Milwaukee?March 3, 2014: Miami #Heat SF Lebron James scored a career-high and franchise-record 61 points in a victory over the Charlotte Hornets while wearing a black mask over his face (for injury purposes). LBJ's 61 PTS still stands as the franchise record https://t.co/7fLuvIPN4P@sebskiiiii @TyherroStan @buks_chitown @BMACK_3 @MiamiHEAT He cannot score on Brook Lopez because there is not a good natural Center on the Miami Heat.

Bam is a natural PF. He's going to struggle against bigger matchups unless Butler finds a jumper (won't happen) or you find a legit 7 footer@leonhartkevin29 @Titan_Cane I'm just trying to figure out how to get Miami Heat tweets off my timeline.@Miamisportsfre1 @TCIIIESQ @MiamiHEAT @NBA Heat fans can never complain about fouls.@MiamiHEAT @FTX_Official In the last 7 games, Jimmy is shooting 39-111 😬😬 4 of those games he's scored 15 or less.   Also 4 or less assist in 9 of 10 games.@sebskiiiii @TyherroStan @buks_chitown @BMACK_3 @MiamiHEAT Bam: 15.5, 9 boards on 45% shooting😭

Brook: 15.8, 4 boards on 60% shooting

Your team has no size for Brook lol, and you're going to continue to struggle against bigger teams until you find actual size

It's not a coincidence that Toronto wiped you twice in a rowSo according to #HeatTwitter logic, the Bucks getting blown out by Cleveland, fully healthy, not  once but twice, is better than @MiamiHEAT losing by a point last night. Yeah where do Miami find these fans.@sebskiiiii @TyherroStan @buks_chitown @BMACK_3 @MiamiHEAT How much Bam average against Brook? What were his splits?

Now tell me Brooks averages.

Their spacing is weak and their one on one scoring is shallow. I would not be confident as a heat fan rn@arjun_hiphop @3cosHank @MiamiHEAT When the balls up for grabs they’re gunna let them play in most crunch time situations.

Your guy there likes the Nets. I disagree. Check his writeup. Two things driving my play. Heat gave away a huge game last night. And Butler was awful.

If the refs constantly has us at the line I’m sure the game would be different too.  It’s not like the Bucks  outplayed us 🤷‍♀️@MiamiHeat_Fra Strus ?@MiamiHEAT The reason Heat lost this is because they ran the same late game out of bounds play they have multiple times lately and its easy to defend and forces a risky pass. Plus caused them to burn a timeout again like last time. Should have run a better play and forced the foul.History makers @MiamiHEAT https://t.co/bOxRpVMeljMilwaukee Bucks defeated Miami Heat 120-119

As he previously said there's the Miami Heat way then there's Jimmy Butler way. Butler should've been benched the 4th. And Herro needs to stop handling the ball..too many turnovers. The ball handler should be Lowry or Vincent. https://t.co/PdEZE92BueAlright it's early but I'm calling it a @Suns @MiamiHEAT nba finals this yr don't @ me we will revisit this when playoffs start lol!!!!!!

Miami is 36-26-1 ATS overall this season, and 6-0-1 ATS in their last seven road games. The Nets have lost their last three at home by a total of 73 points. Take the Heat -3.Jimmy Butler scored just six points and Kyle Lowry missed the game but Miami Heat lost by a point to Milwaukee Bucks??? Miami Heat is a problem and they will be a bigger problem in the playoffs@MiamiHEAT @CoupNBA Jimmy was shooting 3s knowing damn well he was gonna miss smh@JuanGoethe @RealLennyCarlos @schrempfers @MiamiHEAT 8 auch@MiamiHEAT Jimmy is a bum. Overrated and overpaid. Not superstar material@ByTimReynolds Like he had a bad game but are we gonna pretend he hasn't led the Miami Heat to the 1st seed after taking us to the finals 2 years ago?

Game after game with lead Butler pounds the dribble, Spo has zero play designed, shot clock runs down, Heat get bad shot. Heat do not have a go to guy, they win by role players sharing the ball. Butler lost the game.Fuck you @Bucks we shall meet down the road .. this I promise you! Yours sincerely, a @MiamiHEAT fan !!!!@LegionHoops Lebron made the Miami heat better@rajonrondoss Not Miami Heat cos even when healthy LeBron will choke and score 8 points and average 2ppg in the 4 quarters.@MiamiHEAT Is Jimmy fine? Man gotta be playing through an injury or something man. How he’s playing now makes absolutely no senseHeat @ Nets

After losing in a nailbiter, Miami is back, against another Eastern Conference favourite. Butler and co are 5-0-1 ATS in their last 6 on the road. Mills and co are 6-21-1 ATS at home. I know it's a 2 games in 2 days for Miami but 3.5 points is a steal.

I think the Miami HEAT—this current roster—has a real shot at beating the Bucks and getting to the NBA Finals this season. They can hang, and it’s high time they got more nationally-televised games than they currently do. 

Don’t sleep on Miami. https://t.co/8RHpypEw77Miami somehow blows their huge lead but still cover for us!

We took them down to the WIRE without Lowry (literally our entire team basically) and dipo. This sucks but it’s not as bad as y’all are blowing it up to be! Lets chill we still first and we know what we are made of https://t.co/q0wtINuEI8@UpdateUsernameL @MkeJax @MiamiHEAT That doesn’t mean anything come playoff time. You lose one game and you lose homecourt. This isn’t the nfl@xlrxdzxx @RatiodbyBando @WadexFlash @MiamiHEAT you celebrating this like it the championship?The @Bucks worked to slowly give this game away, but then after the @MiamiHEAT were up 99%!!! @Jrue_Holiday11 came thru and ended it with a #wall https://t.co/J2RhMp16IdCheck out this listing I just added to my #Poshmark closet: Miami heat jersey. https://t.co/ughCUKl4oC #shopmycloset @poshmarkapp@MiamiHEAT @CoupNBA Stop tweeting@CantHoldHerro @MiamiHEAT @CoupNBA dawg 😭@missysinghsongs @LaCanucks @MiamiHEAT They won’t stay on top if they can’t close out games.

That was a foul. We all know it. We all see when player go up for a ball they get called for a foul. I get where the game was at but still vice versa Giannis would been shooting FT.I can’t believe what I just watched, how we @MiamiHEAT lose like that@DisappointedI11 @HeatvsHaters Believe it was 2013 Bucks vs Heat

More importantly, The Bucks are 5-4 in the playoffs vs Miami in the Giannis-Butler era. Obviously he's not gonna say that out loud@MiamiHEAT Encouraging loss without having Kyle. Losing to the champs by 1 on their floor without our floor general? I'll take it proudly@MiamiHEAT @CoupNBA y’all made us brokeBucks Big-3 combine for 79 points, go on a 21-6 run, and beat Miami Heat 120-119! 👀

Still good for him for having a big night.@MiamiHEAT Great game Bucks see you down the road. #Thisaintover.@champagneAbe1 @MiamiHEAT C'mon! 6pts in last 6 mins andu blame the refs? 😄👍As he should be!!!! 😡 @MiamiHEAT https://t.co/Hqz9Yp752f@knationgfx @BallyHEAT @MiamiHEAT Blaming Herro when he was the reason the Heat were winning to begin with is funny@MiamiHEAT I really sad@MiamiHEAT 99.1% winning probability with 5 min left. That was a huge waste of an amazing game and effort with a MIA Butler..@john1083478108 @WadexFlash @MiamiHEAT i hate fans like this bro more free throws don’t mean better calls that’s just worse defense plus jimmy thought he was smart purposely fouling gianni’s when he went 9/11🤣🤣🤣Tough Loss @MiamiHEAT 🤦🏿‍♂️🤦🏿‍♂️ We Gonna Bounce Bakk FASHOOOO@WadexFlash @UNISOLDIERMUA @MiamiHEAT Couldn’t have put it any better... + Lowry has been steeping up offensively when butler has struggled, especially late in game like when we played Charlotte. If he’s there the last 2 minutes of the game tonight we would have 1 more win.@MiamiHEAT That fkin turnover by Herro! We played good 47 min and 35 seconds. It is what it is. Hope we bounce back tomorrow@BrownsPlsTank @MiamiHEAT Have a good night buddy. 👍@JabbaDuhHo @MiamiHEAT How you hating wit a picture of lebron with a heat shirt on lol 🤣🤣🤣 we will see yall in the playoffs lol@JabbaDuhHo @WadexFlash @MiamiHEAT Bro we missing our starting point guard  and you all barely won. We sleeping you all in the playoffs@GIANNIS_GOATED @WadexFlash @MiamiHEAT Weird if you coulda been on top wouldn’t you be there? 🤣 Y’all talk like we didn’t earn this by winning games. Y’all 4th because you didn’t win enough 🤷‍♀️. BTW we still at the top. We could lose again and STILL be at the top 😂😂🤣🤣😂🤣@MkeJax @MiamiHEAT sadly the bucks aren't #1 tho. wonder who is..You think this is going to save you? @MiamiHEAT https://t.co/zczdnHEhot@chertz I’ll be in Miami Friday am - lived there until start of Covid - miss my friends, the coffee, the heat, the sunshine - not the stupid@MiamiHEAT Play Kyle Guy instead of Jimmy and we win this game.@TheRealRony305 @MiamiHEAT We’re not winning another chip with just Jimmy. We need a REAL superstar who can shoot a 3.@MiamiHEAT Didn’t watch tonight because I thought heat would lose. Check score see they are up and put the game on. I watch them blow 12 point lead or some shit and lose the game with 1 second left. I’m going back to the hub@HeatvsHaters Miami Heat 🔥 mistake was not leaving Gabe Vincent in the gameFUCK YOU @Miamiheat AND TYLER HERRO U DUMBASS FUCKIN IDIOT HOLD ONTO THE BALL AND MAKE FREE THROWS https://t.co/3jVT2tcMqF@MiamiHEAT Herro had a hell of a game, but also had 3 crucial turnovers in the end that cost us the game… sloppy and careless at a time where he should have been locked in. Too bad…bad lossI’m done, but lmao @MiamiHEAT@MrAlvarez1_187 @MiamiHEAT We always do that too! Thats why it doesnt matter if we have 20pts lead, i cant relax til there is 2min left and up by that much! Lol@MiamiHEAT Poor coaching decision to put ice cold Butler back in when the unit on the floor was getting the job done.@ImMaseMan @HolidayJrueTime @MiamiHEAT 100% I’m surprised that wasn’t called@povertybucksfan @GiannisLamar_ @MiamiHEAT Whats funny about this tho ?@MiamiHEAT Submit a bunch of fouls on the bucks please@JabbaDuhHo @TheMustacheKid1 @LilRoyIvan @TrolledByJimmy @MiamiHEAT He dove on him , not that ball . That’s a foul@Darththanaton98 @MiamiHEAT Explain how Bam performed better than Herro@NickHarris247 Im glad it wasn’t a blowout. Bucks should be worried that They stole this win cause for 3 games Miami has outplayed them except 1 minute. Lol bucks only good win was against shorthanded heat@MiamiHEAT life was better when you sat out Butler in the 4th.@MiamiHEAT SIT JIMMY IF HE'S NOT GOING TO CONTRIBUTE ANYTHING ALRIGHT????Have fun paying him @MiamiHEAT https://t.co/ocyPSK8kjL https://t.co/Tkwzrqo54r@rosseel_david @BallySportsFL @MiamiHEAT It was a full court shot@HeatvsHaters @MiamiHEAT Bam missing frees , and jimmy going 2/14.. on a night where everybody who took a shot except for strus and dedmon go for 40% or more from the field even Duncan wiith 71.4%… fuck it tho Dipo Day looming🔜The Miami Heat are currently the #1 seed in the East, but have had a tough time against the upper echelon of teams. Their record in 2022 is 18-9 but are 14-2 against teams under .500 and only 4-7 against teams over .500.@MiamiHEAT Refs don’t want to see us win.@JabbaDuhHo @TheMustacheKid1 @LilRoyIvan @TrolledByJimmy @MiamiHEAT He literally had his arm all over jimmy’s head@MiamiHEAT Jimmy played awful. Didn’t deserve to win@MiamiHEAT FTs 24 (bucks) vs 12 (heat). Ya…I see how the Bucks are better.Ouch! 🥲 @MiamiHEAT@XANDERGARITA @HeatvsHaters @MiamiHEAT @DoorDash almost put a hole through the tv in the last 2 minutes@HeatvsHaters @MiamiHEAT 2-14 from a max player kill me now@MiamiHEAT That was definitely a painful way to lose a game
 But on to the next one@MiamiHEAT NO EXCUSES. WE KEEP TAKING LEADS AND WE KEEP GIVING IT AWAY AS IF THEY PRACTICE THAT SHIT. JIMMY WAS NO WHERE TO BE FOUND. WE TAKE THE L AND GO BEAT BROOKLYN@MiamiHEAT Refs gave that away@LaCanucks @MiamiHEAT spurs arent even in the top 10 lmfao@dneedles12 @DrewOlsonMKE @RealGilbert @MiamiHEAT @Bucks I give him a ton of credit for getting Heat team to finals two years ago. Let's also give props to Heat GM for finding Vincent, Strus, Martin and Robinson.@RatiodbyBando @finnation @xlrxdzxx @WadexFlash @MiamiHEAT Giannis was getting a lot of fouls that Bam was making the same plays and not getting.  There is literally a possession where Bam drives in and gets hammered and no call, Giannis the very next play does the same thing and gets the foul lol@clxete @jctheclemente @WadexFlash @MiamiHEAT bro what refs called shit calls lol he played 10 minutes in the first half heat fans r delusional because of foul trouble@MiamiHEAT This didn’t age too well…We lost because of bad calls but Jimmy didn’t show up and Miami blew an amazing lead. Besides that the Miami Heat are still the beast of the East and better then the Bucks this season and in a 7 game series fully healthy the Heat take it in 6. #HEATCultureI hate Miami heat man😭 this is a fat W@MiamiHEAT Show Jimmy on this losing poster it’s his fault 😒@MiamiHEAT Jimmy Bubble🔥🔥🔥@MiamiHEAT Jimmy is so bad. His offense sucks. He should be a role player next yr tbh. I don't know if we can still rely on him. You want miami to be your team but why can't you improve your offensive game? You got out of minny and philly because of your team mates yet u are here backwards@idoartbro @MiamiHEAT Yea and whats with all his 3 pt shot attempts? 
Who told him that’s his role?@TylerHeroSTAN @MiamiHEAT Nah I’m saying he only made 2 shots the whole game and we lost by 1@BallyHEAT @MiamiHEAT Blame the refs all you want 

Jimmy Butler going 2–14 does not win you a basketball game@JV1heatlifer @MiamiHEAT me too 💀@MiamiHEAT Jimmy stinks. He ain’t that good. And what? That’s suppose to be out leader??@MiamiHEAT Spo should not put back Jimmy and Tucker in the game.. that's what cost us the game.@MiamiHEAT count your fucking days. https://t.co/KNZPoUnKIa@Play_4_Keeps_A1 @kobebulikk @abdemayo @filippp9_ @MiamiHEAT not our problem he's out again for personal reasonsPels -4.5 ✅
Miami Heat +4.5 ✅@BrownsPlsTank @MiamiHEAT Don't have anything to say so you just copy me. Got it. Enjoy the win but like I said, still 1st in the east.@MiamiHEAT gotta bounce back.@FinsHeatSox @Bam_Adobobayo @MiamiHEAT ohhhh haaaaaaaaaa@HolidayJrueTime @MiamiHEAT I’d love to see the Bucks in ECF. We all saw who the better team is out there this year and that was without Lowry, Dipo, and let be honest Butler lol. https://t.co/Vyqvd1M0Kl@MiamiHEAT Butler 🤡@HeatvsHaters @MiamiHEAT cant wait for donovan mitch@HeatvsHaters @MiamiHEAT Really glad I missed this one 🥺@FinsHeatSox @Bam_Adobobayo @MiamiHEAT no, deserved.Miami Heat Trust 25%😩😭@JV1heatlifer @MiamiHEAT We always have those unfortunately. Thats why its important not to screw up too much. I guess its better now than in the playoffs, come up with better plays than that for next time we ever in that situation again.@MiamiHEAT We're really lost to this trash ass team. Smh@HeatvsHaters @MiamiHEAT I’ve been sitting like this for 10 mins https://t.co/GatSdq36DL@LaCanucks @MiamiHEAT Just an FYI we’re still sitting on top. Also how can you defend a team that plays defense by just forcing people out of bounds? The refs didn’t seem to notice two very obvious fouls. Be interesting to read the NBA review when it’s posted.@dariyus23 @nathanmarzion @MiamiHEAT Dawg it’s regular season. Playoffs a whole new season. Yal still choked though.@buks_chitown @BMACK_3 @MiamiHEAT butler can have 10 field goals but have just a normal shooting day for your shooters and still lost, dude you surely didnt realize y'all had 50% on your threes tonight?? these types of excuses is just stupid bruh its not always everything falling on your way@LaCanucks @MiamiHEAT bro what@HeatvsHaters @MiamiHEAT Ik we still number 1 but the choke and we coukd all see it coming and could do nothing about it really hurts man@MiamiHEAT Sellers@HeatvsHaters @MiamiHEAT don't let Jimmy in the team plane, make him pay for his flight or he can uber to Brooklyn.The @MiamiHEAT had the to play Vs 8 (3 of them had whistles) in that 4th QT. WTF@MiamiHEAT This one hurts@TJMakeI @MiamiHEAT And he didn’t tho@MiamiHEAT A 14 point lead and y’all blew it…@808sAndBucks @LeroyJenkins578 @HolidayJrueTime @MiamiHEAT Didn’t y’all blow a 14 point lead in the playoffs a couple years ago in the 4th? 😂😂@MkeJax @MiamiHEAT He ain’t no superstar he a glorified role player lolz@dariyus23 @nathanmarzion @MiamiHEAT Lowry* and we didn’t have Brook Lopez, Patty C, and George Hill. Can’t pull that card. Plus 21 3s you guys hit that ain’t normal@Faz3rs @MiamiHEAT Exactly ,@DadeTeflonDon @MiamiHEAT Naw he would have more that jimmy tbh 😂😂😂😂@HeatvsHaters @MiamiHEAT Im so hurt@BHDOOOM @MiamiHEAT It ain’t my fault 😩@cramper205 @Ocho_Murph @MiamiHEAT Not to mention they had GABE VINCENT and CALEB MARTIN shooting the shit out of the ball

It's a miracle that they were close@HeatvsHaters @MiamiHEAT That one hurt 💔@ThePharticusMax @MiamiHEAT @iamzo33 Zo would have sent that shit into the stands. If Bam was there sooner he either blocks the shot or forces Holiday to pass the ball with just seconds left on the clock.@MiamiHEAT Take the L@HeatvsHaters @MiamiHEAT most painful heat game ive watched in a long time@HeatvsHaters @MiamiHEAT This one stung@tinystickboi @Semi4Mvp @InsertHyper @MkeJax @MiamiHEAT Not my fault when this shit is in my feed@MiamiHEAT jrue holiday owns ur franchise@TylerHeroSTAN @MiamiHEAT It took every bit of jimmy making 2 shots for them to win by 1. Idk why y’all overreacting@mikeymaas36 @HolidayJrueTime @MiamiHEAT 5 second no call is somewhat debatable. Refs were on one tonight.@MiamiHEAT WE OWN YALLAlso the @MiamiHEAT are 8-3 on the season vs 3 of the top teams in the East … Bulls 76ers and Nets … see u in the playoffs@MiamiHEAT pain.@MiamiHEAT Jimmy was terrible this game. But seriously how do the refs not call the foul on that inbound play clearly Jimmy got fouled@honkbonk25 @Princeopersia2 @MkeJax @MiamiHEAT That is not happening lmaoWinderman’s view: Kevin Durant up next, plus thoughts on Heat-Bucks #Miami #Heat #NBA https://t.co/NtqLw4XgnY@ThePharticusMax @MiamiHEAT @iamzo33 Easy answer. He worried about Giannis who’s got 120lb Herro on him getting the quick pass and slam@boscosilva09 @MiamiHEAT It's basketball. It was a competitive game throughout. Shit happens. Moving on, still lost to us tonight and choked@ThePharticusMax @MiamiHEAT @iamzo33 I agree wit u. Guys like Giannis and embiid r blocking that almost every time@ojmcduffie81 @MiamiHEAT @ojmcduffie81  look at my last tweet 😂I spoke too soon smh @MiamiHEAT@InsertHyper @MkeJax @MiamiHEAT And if the points counted we would have won by more@MiamiHEAT Where tf is your ass @Klow7@MiamiHEAT 💔? Thats just an epic collapse for the ages https://t.co/TVTc8dunH7@MiamiHEAT RENT FREE https://t.co/OwgnP2hGleMiami Heat Good It's Just Som About Em I Don't Believe in Em@TheMageech @MiamiHEAT Damn back to back L’s@GIANNIS_GOATED @WadexFlash @MiamiHEAT Took bucks 50 years to win 1 ring@finnation @xlrxdzxx @WadexFlash @MiamiHEAT Well you guys were purposely sending Giannis to the line so ofc. It just didn’t work out for you because Giannis wasn’t missing@lowryxbam @khashdinero @MiamiHEAT u guys kept fouling, simple as that@MiamiHEAT tough loss fueled by sloppy play down the stretch. Can’t carry this energy into Brooklyn tomorrow for Durants first game back.Gotta bounce back quick against the Nets tomorrow.. Coach Spo is going to have to find a way to get the team to be better at closing out games! Let’s get that W tomorrow night @MiamiHEAT #SportsWithSoSo #InCaseYouAintKnowSo #SportsTweets@MiamiHEAT The tandem of Jimmy Butler and Bam Adebayo can only take a team so far when matched up against teams with size. Milwaukee’s length always bothers Jimmy, while Bam picks up silly fouls and misses easy shots.@MiamiHEAT this loss on Jimmy!!God.  I hated the @MiamiHEAT loss.  Feels just like the @CanesHoops loss to VT last week. Both just leaving the "how the f--- did we lose that game? WTF!?!?"

Totally blown games by poor decisions in the final minutess@asimancas305 @MiamiHEAT They clearly blew a 10 point lead with 3 minutes left in the game and couldn't execute an inbounds play, if that happens you deserve to lose, pretty sure anyone would agree with me lol@TyherroStan @MiamiHEAT I’m sick right now@Macgyver1312 @WadexFlash @MiamiHEAT Swept if Harden and Kyrie was healthy lol@MiamiHEAT I m sooo mad now, how about Tyler Herro's turnover?🤬@MkeJax @MiamiHEAT The play where Giannes and Jimmy went for the loose ball, Giannes clearly fouled him by rule. But great game tho🤝🏽@SilvasGoat @MiamiHEAT Your “superstar” player scored 6 points LMFAOOO@OrtizGeb @MiamiHEAT I love that guy, but it’s the truth@InsertHyper @MkeJax @MiamiHEAT there was damn near no contact please watch back butler of jimmy just fell 2-14🤣👏🏼 jrue affect@BallyHEAT @MiamiHEAT And after months of training, is that the best offensive play the team can come up to put the ball in game?@MiamiHEAT Butler 2-14 for 6 points lolol #FearTheDeer@808sAndBucks @HolidayJrueTime @MiamiHEAT I guess but that’s a foul. GG@JabbaDuhHo @WadexFlash @MiamiHEAT giannis literally committed a take foul on bam late in the game that the refs just let walk@BallySportsFL @MiamiHEAT Ouch. Talk about a tweet not aging well… https://t.co/Q7qEdDIqGCHey guys, the Miami Heat still own the No. 1 seed in the Eastern Conference. 

I believe they will be fine and the sky is not falling after one bad loss to a really good basketball team.@MiamiHEAT 4th quarter ....6 pts in last 6 minutes????!!!!!!!SPO is not a real coach..Spo and I watching the game The only difference between me and SPO I am paying to watch he is getting paid to watch@MiamiHEAT Jimmy and Tyler broke my heart.@LaGoat8_ @820bulls @MiamiHEAT Heat fans are 💯@MiamiHEAT Jimmy butler tonight https://t.co/VXbq0f4GGB@MiamiHEAT Y'all choked harder than murray's girlfriend🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣@BallySportsFL @MiamiHEAT And then?@JimmysBurner5 @MiamiHEAT I don’t think you want that lol@XCrypticTritonX @MiamiHEAT Didnt win us shit, Bam did@povertybucksfan @MiamiHEAT This is funnier than it should be@bucks__stan @Princeopersia2 @MkeJax @MiamiHEAT 4-0 Miami this tine around@LeroyJenkins578 @HolidayJrueTime @MiamiHEAT you just gotta accept slander if you lose when you have a 14 point lead in the fourth@emilyhrnandz @MiamiHEAT cavs with out no lebron is better than the heat!!! btw lebron, wade and bosh made the heat not overrated bulter of jimmy@SwitchWaveYT @MiamiHEAT say thank you to him Switch https://t.co/Wbdr0pAC4Q@MiamiHEAT Damn! 😢@DadeTeflonDon @MiamiHEAT he’s washed@MiamiHEAT Jimmy should’ve just sat this one down. Useless. Cost them the game. Smh@JabbaDuhHo @WadexFlash @MiamiHEAT This image displays how even Giannis can't handle Jimmy if he were a baby. Heat in fo, reg season dont matter &lt;3@MiamiHEAT No reason to put Jimmy back in when we had the momentum up 14.   21-6 run as soon as he came back.  Caleb was playing great too.@MiamiHEAT For all they say Giannis plays worse against the Heat, its true. You defend him very well. Really. 28-17-5. And you defend him very well. Its wasnt Jimmy's night. 6-3-1😬@LamarGoatson1 @MiamiHEAT Send me the addy 👀@MiamiHEAT Did Jimmy butler get traded to the bucks? He was playing for them today.@MiamiHEAT Wasted efforts of the bench@MiamiHEAT Tyler herro doesn’t know how to dribble.I’m sick. Miami gave that game away man. Milwaukee was getting smacked and should’ve lost smh. Heat in 5.@HolidayJrueTime @MiamiHEAT Kinda nuts the big Heat and Bucks accounts went from absolutely slandering each other to having actual respect for each other (but still slandering)

I’m here for it tbh@MiamiHEAT PainCan’t believe we lost this game @MiamiHEAT 🤦🏻‍♂️@JabbaDuhHo @MiamiHEAT Series 2-1 this season get a life@TrolledByJimmy @MiamiHEAT this you? https://t.co/k5CL9d2pTr@MiamiHEAT Jimmy was struggling 🤦‍♀️@InsertHyper @ov_pedro14 @MiamiHEAT Dude Jimmy was 2 for 14 from the field and shot 14% for the game. No way Giannis has never done that in his entire career. Cuz he dominates in the paint which is an advantage even on off nights Giannis FG percentages are respectable@MiamiHEAT Bucks got some home cooking.@ojmcduffie81 @MiamiHEAT That jump ball at the end shouldn't jabe been a jump ball they fouled the shit out of Jimmy and didn't call it crazy how it was such a good game to let the damn officials ruin it at the end . It never fails@MiamiHEAT Bubble frauds Buck own your franchise@LYNNuminati @MiamiHEAT Played sloppy at the end@Macgyver1312 @WadexFlash @MiamiHEAT I know you weren’t ready to send a tweet with no expectation of actually winning but you could of gave yourself a min to come up with something better. We all saw the better team out there. We’d love to see the bucks in the playoffs 😎@LeroyJenkins578 @HolidayJrueTime @MiamiHEAT Unfortunately, you’ll still hear plenty of slander. But you’ll get a GG from me. Always fun watching this matchup@MiamiHEAT Butler was playing nothing, but coach Spo decided to bench C. Martin to give Milwaukee the game with Butler. Insane@DadeTeflonDon @MiamiHEAT lmaooo even Winslow would’ve shot better 😭😭😭Milwaukee Bucks Vs Miami Heat,  it's a possible matchup for the Eastern Conference final..@Bam_Adobobayo @MiamiHEAT To the dude on the right@khashdinero @TrolledByJimmy @MiamiHEAT jrue affect😈@MiamiHEAT Crunch time without Lowry is terrible.Rough loss for our @MiamiHEAT tonight in Milwaukee… I wasn’t thrilled with how Gabe Vincent decided to play that last bit of defense… too easy of a layup with time running out.. #SportsWithSoSo #InCaseYouAintKnowSo #SportsTweets #MiamiSportsPodcast #RT@MiamiHEAT Just smashed my 4K TV in rage. This team is embarrassing me in front of my entire family. My 2 children are in tears, scared of my rage as I pace around the room trembling. I can’t take this anymore. Make trades immediately or my kids will not get dinner tomorrow.@TyherroStan @EA_Akira @WadexFlash @MiamiHEAT Herro messed up at the end big time@Maui_anne @MiamiHEAT And a few bad calls...@Abby52142798 The Miami Heat are the worst team wver@MiamiHEAT @PonyThaCHAMPony This is going to be a legendary ECF. Can’t wait. Glad I can go back to Cheering on PJ for a while@MiamiHEAT this is sad..we gave up 7pts in 30seconds@bucks__stan @Princeopersia2 @MkeJax @MiamiHEAT RatioThe young players make stupid ass decisions in the clutch and Jimmy Butler has never been A closer. How desperately this team needs @VicOladipo @MiamiHEAT@MiamiHEAT we OWN you.@MiamiHEAT Respond tomorrow@MiamiHEAT People killing Jimmy like he ain't allowed to have an off night lol
Herro couldn't miss and was on fire and Jimmy was cold

And we was missing our pg right?@Princeopersia2 @MkeJax @MiamiHEAT Bucks in 4 sweep@honkbonk25 @MkeJax @MiamiHEAT This was a game deciding call that wasn’t. Can’t argue with that@TheMustacheKid1 @LilRoyIvan @TrolledByJimmy @MiamiHEAT there was literally no contact watch the play jimmy went to the ground for no reason@MiamiHEAT I’m on the bench, I win this game. Coaching can win some games too.@MiamiHEAT almost kms in that last quarter@DadeTeflonDon @MiamiHEAT Atleast Winslow can shoot@ojmcduffie81 @MiamiHEAT If this was 10 years ago my remote control would have been through my TV lol@MiamiHEAT Hold that L bozos! #sweetrevenge https://t.co/etQtmqBkvT@Bam_Adobobayo @MiamiHEAT Disrespectful@MiamiHEAT GGs to y’all see u in the ECF 🤝@MiamiHEAT Jimmy going to show up tomorrow...?@Giannis_An34 FOULED @JimmyButler on the INBOUNDS and @Jrue_Holiday11 came with the CLEAR and BLATANT pushOFF on @iamgabevincent2 AND the REFS swallowed their WHISTLES on BOTH occasions!!! But it SHOULDN'T have COME to DOWN to THAT.

It is not logical to let go of a victory that was in the pocketThis @MiamiHEAT games are gonna kill me one day 😩 it didn't go our way, NEXT #goheatYall had one fucking job @MiamiHEAT smh@Flashbaka @MiamiHEAT No, Jimmy fucking sucked.@InsertHyper @MkeJax @MiamiHEAT Middleton got the bullshit charge so I wouldn't talk@Princeopersia2 @MkeJax @MiamiHEAT Bucks in 4 🤡@JabbaDuhHo @WadexFlash @MiamiHEAT Wasn't 5secFuck the Miami heat@MiamiHEAT They will see them in the playoffs with dipo@MiamiHEAT Just flipped over our table and smashed the TV with a pitcher of Coors at Chili’s in front of 20+ friends and family. My wife and kids are in tears as they wait for the cops to arrive. Just shoved our waiter to the ground in rage. I can’t do this any longer. Goodbye Heat fans.@HolidayJrueTime @MiamiHEAT Gg though we choked but was a bs call at the end𝙏𝙃𝙀 𝙈𝘼𝙉 𝙊𝙁 𝙏𝙃𝙀 𝙉𝙄𝙂𝙃𝙏

Jrue Holiday was all smiles with @ZoraStephenson after hitting the clutch bucket to defeat the Miami Heat. #FearTheDeer https://t.co/DiMImpWMGu@EMD4ME Hey Rick I just watched Giannis travel 59 times against the @MiamiHEAT@MkeJax @MiamiHEAT This game was literally rigged for the Bucks lmao@Ocho_Murph @MiamiHEAT We'll see you when we got Brook lol Bam isn't doing this again, enjoy it@MiamiHEAT Regardless of how this night ended, we should really work on closing games better and realizing who has the hot hand. Stop feeding it to guys like Butler who are struggling on Offense. Giving him the ball only forces him to try and make something work.@LilRoyIvan @TrolledByJimmy @MiamiHEAT That no call should’ve sent Jimmy to the line for free throws not a jump ball@MiamiHEAT Jimmy Butler when he has to play the bucks with fans https://t.co/gTUfkShDhu@MiamiHEAT Jimmy is a liability on the offensive end these days, his defence is excellent and we need it but fuck me his shot iq is terrible@InsertHyper @MkeJax @MiamiHEAT Bruh what? He’s going for the ball. Jimmy instantly goes to the ground looking for that call. F outta here@MiamiHEAT PAIN admin@BrownsPlsTank @MiamiHEAT It's basketball. It was a competitive game throughout. Shit happens. Moving on, still 1st in the east.@MiamiHEAT What’s up with jimmy man@MiamiHEAT Late game offense.....AGAINMiami Heat always our bitch 😅😅😅@JeffHardyStan @MiamiHEAT That’s where Kyle Lowry comes into play. He reads the floor better than Tyler@Darththanaton98 @MiamiHEAT Y’all wouldn’t have even been in the game without him. He did lose a crucial possession but most of it should be in Jimmy since he shot terribly and overall didn’t step up.@tcainkimball @MiamiHEAT I honestly don’t think plus minus is a good stat but pain.One of the few times I get upset with Spo. Why didn’t he Challenge that foul that should have been a charge?
Momentum changed from then. 
Along with other bad decisions by the players! This one hurt. We gave this one away!! @MiamiHEAT #Heat@MiamiHEAT YOU SOLDDDDDRIP BOZO @MiamiHEAT https://t.co/iPiWLxFz6o@MiamiHEAT Fix your shitRefs hoe'd us @MiamiHEAT@MiamiHEAT Please Fire that black guy who plays Number 22@WadexFlash @MiamiHEAT don’t get me started?💀 y’all should’ve had a 5 second turnover down the stretch and were saved AND gianni’s was in foul trouble on terrible calls bro heat fans always got excuses https://t.co/X4h6z4a4f4@lowryxbam @MiamiHEAT We just beat the #1 Seed 😂😂😂😂@MiamiHEAT BRO HOW@MiamiHEAT Jimmy Butler cannot shoot, should not close the game. Jumper is missing… fix that@MiamiHEAT GG BOYS 👌 https://t.co/OwrRqQkb22Yes, we deserve all of the Slander tonight. @MiamiHEATLmaoooo I hate Miami Heat😂😂😂😂😂@MiamiHEAT Choke city, we had one job. Plus it didn't help that the refs were favoring the bucks the whole 4th quarter@MiamiHEAT Jimmy gotta do better, act at least interested.@buks_chitown @BMACK_3 @MiamiHEAT But it’s still a loss… just sayin’@MiamiHEAT Bro why do we blow so many leads. This giving me 2019-20 flashbacks.@MiamiHEAT fans what’s the excuse now? Both teams healthy 🤣@DaveWielhouwer @MiamiHEAT And I mean Tyler herro was wide the hell open,It pissed me off,Why the fuck was he looking at Jimmy in the first place when he was having an off game(6pt),I’m so pissed@MiamiHEAT LMFAOOOOO@MiamiHEAT My goodness nigga how? Herro's fault smh@arjun_hiphop @MiamiHEAT Cope https://t.co/bPqOFGCei2@dariyus23 @nathanmarzion @MiamiHEAT Were 3 games outta 1st lmaoYou can’t throw a guy on the court and then call a jump ball. Referees cannot dictate the outcome of a game like that. @NBATV @NBAonTNT @ESPNNBA #DadeCountyBoysAProblem @KendrickPerkins @MiamiHEAT No Lowry, No Victor Oladipo.Ngl, the Miami Heat were winning when Jimmy was on the bench. When he returned, the Bucks came back and Butler himself sold the game. 🤣@JimmysBurner5 @MiamiHEAT You really want that? https://t.co/wJeWDLQHUG@MonkeysGG_ @820bulls @MiamiHEAT He’s a menace. Shouldn’t be in the league.@JB22STAN @MiamiHEAT Will be betting bud under next game@3cosHank @Flashbaka @MiamiHEAT Lol please don’t tell me someone from WISCONSIN is talking shit@laz_ur @MiamiHEAT Yea yea we will see you later when we got Lowry@3cosHank @MiamiHEAT Ngl this funny😂@MiamiHEAT You can’t lose that game. I blame spo. Keep in the hot lineup. Jimmy was trash all night@MiamiHEAT “We got shooter” mayn fuck the shooters, bucks In fo https://t.co/ASUBM9fm1y@MiamiHEAT We will clean this up before the playoffs.@xlrxdzxx @WadexFlash @MiamiHEAT bucks shot 17 more freethrows ? ratio kid@MiamiHEAT I'm still proud of my team. Butler no my love 6 points is not going to get the job done. Sometimes you look like you are afraid to play against Holiday.@MiamiHEAT Tough loss. Blew a lead. Played terrible the last 6 minutes. Refs vs HeatThat was really bad loss for @MiamiHEAT . Shot 50% from three for most of the game, was able to respond every time @Bucks tried to make run.

Heat's achilles heel has always been shot creation. If those guys gonna hit pull up 3s like this... lol48 of Miami’s 92 points have come on threes, the Heat have made 55% of their looks there, and yet the Bucks are only down 3. Not too mad at Milwaukee’s night so far.Bucks only down 4 with how well Miami has shot from 3. Heat are gonna live and die by that shot tonight.The Heat and Bucks have taken turns throwing punches (not literally, ofc) at each other for 3 quarters. Miami's gotten some really good shooting for their guys but you get the feel that for them to close it out, Jimmy's offense is going to have to show up here.@MiamiHEAT Holy that’s was curry rangeWhatever happens this season, I love this @MiamiHEAT teamI would have flipped the coffee table over if Herro hit that shot #miamiheatHate the Miami heat so fucking much@MiamiHEAT This feels like a playoff game.@MiamiHEAT Make sure Jimmy keeps his ass in that seat for the rest of the game… he can fly commercial too while he’s at it@BallyHEAT @MiamiHEAT Herro and Bam the future 🔥💯Heat withstood a Bucks run.
