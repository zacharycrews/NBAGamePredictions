@hooptalk918 https://t.co/P7zLOFSXod@ktjazz14 @trailblazers @utahjazz @evanmobley @dariusgarland22 I think they'll pay Garland (he's not worthy of a max nor is he a better player) .  They painter themsves into this corner going back to the offseason and it's no question they're regretting it 

Garland good player hes a #3 Sexton is a 1.5-2 

SIZABLE GAP@ktjazz14 @trailblazers @utahjazz @evanmobley @dariusgarland22 Well we see Sexton differently 
He's much more than just an elite scorer .  He's one of the better secondary playmakers despite being new to the position AND even his critics acknowledge his dramatic defensive improvement@ktjazz14 @trailblazers @utahjazz I liked what aolshey did he just missed one crucial part to make them a viable team long term ...two actually🏀 Portland Trail Blazers (@trailblazers) #RipCity
