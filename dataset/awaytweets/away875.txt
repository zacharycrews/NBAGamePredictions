Funny how the Liberal gurus defended a “Take-a-Knee-Disrespect-the-American-Flag” quarterback, Colin Kaepernick.@_tep13 @WhatIfiWasWhYte @slabGod_ His legacy in Houston is being one of the best offensive players in history and leader of the 2018 rockets who were the only ones to challenge the KD warriors and who will go down as one of the best teams to not win a ring (would’ve won if cp3 didn’t get injured)If you’re at all surprised that @EnesFreedom was waived by the Houston Rockets… You still don’t understand that sports has more politics baked into it than many other industries.

I hope you don't win a championship until you do the right thing and stand up against Chinese human rights abuses.In 84' the Blazers offered the Rockets the 2nd pick and Clyde Drexler for Ralph Sampson. Houston declined but if they said yes we could have seen them have the 1st and 2nd pick. Meaning we could have seen Olajuwon, Michael Jordan, and Drexler on the same team in Houston.

The picks owed to OKC from 2024-26. Perhaps Stone/whoever is trying to speed-build so Houston rejoins contention soon &amp; the picks become worse.
