THE @SacramentoKings SEASON IS HERE! https://t.co/7a3SupseRzKings/Blazers under 234.5

Sacramento should be a little improved defensively. This inflated total is based on being one of the worst defenses of all time last season. They drafted a great defender with 9th pick and aren’t playing Bagley who is horrible defensively @FadeUsports.@trailblazers vs. @SacramentoKings

Plus, Sacramento is so much more entrainment when they're good. 
Plus, Id have been able to see larry bird 2.0 every game without having to pay for it.@GenderPretender @SacramentoKings @swipathefox Very anti-intellectual perspective you’ve got there. So you believe in feelings&gt;substantive evidence?@NYCKNP Interesting. Personally, I thought about moving the @SacramentoKings to Vegas, partly because I think that having FOUR teams in California is a little too much, and partly because it would be cheaper to relocate than to expand.🗓️ Hoy 20/10

Homecoming King was one of my favorite Netflix hours of all time. The creativity and innovation and heart and storytelling in that show...damn.

Otherwise, you’re just arguing from personal feelings.When the Sacramento Kings take the floor tonight in the 2021-22 season opener, it is expected that Marvin Bagley III will not be included in Luke Walton's rotation. https://t.co/oxiSjFk027@James_HamNBA Will miss the coverage on the Sacramento Kings that James Ham has provided for the past decade or more. Best of luck in your new endeavors James.@chimeziegoated @SacramentoKings @swipathefox Very neat :)@JeffGold81 @SacramentoKings Lol how cute. How naive and cute you are Jeff. When you get your heartbroken and need a shoulder to cry on, or maybe an ass to eat, I’m right here for you.@GenderPretender @SacramentoKings @swipathefox A study from Harvard demonstrated that the protests themselves were overwhelmingly peaceful. If you have any studies to the contrary, I’m all ears.

https://t.co/RPPxmfnyYv@SacramentoKings That game in NOLA last year might be my fave Fox game ever@SacramentoKings sm1 tell me who is this https://t.co/U09QgMINKi@GenderPretender @SacramentoKings @swipathefox Yes. The majority of the violence during BLM protests was instigated by white supremacists (you can find a number of articles on the subject). Furthermore, rioting and looting result from large-scale protest movements in general.

I realize this is prediction is neither bold nor inspiring. Prove me wrong, Sacramento.@sactowncrown How would I listen to the Sacramento Kings on iTunes@Jiggly6 @SacramentoKings Expecting nothing, but hoping for at least 8 seed 🙃CONTENT ... #SacramentoKings ... What PLATFORM do you most often listen/watch? #sacramentokingsFirst game of the season tonight. Ready to be let down like the last 16 years of @SacramentoKings basketball @slowjoeeeBlazers will look sloppy but get the W against the Kings tonight. They always have one inexplicable loss to Sacramento per season but it's usually on the roadJust over a year ago, I was locked in on joining TKH (then StR) as my goal. 

Now, I’m lucky enough to rub shoulders with this group and annoy them with my absurd love for 2nd round picks &amp; defense.

#SacramentoProud@P1ASAP @SpencerCatalan4 @SacramentoKings Shai thrived with no to very little floor spacing and you’re complaining about Buddy? Without him it’ll be harder for Dox to score.

He doesn’t need to be traded imo. If he doesn’t improve this season then cool but not now.@NotEvn90 @SacramentoKings @gilgamino Lol what kind of social media team wouldn’t include a guy who’s still on the roster? Besides it seems like this graphic is designed based on the rotation and Bagley is probably still the 10th man, but Luke is likely only playing 9 hence Bagley is out of the rotation for now 🤷🏻‍♂️Good luck to @TyHaliburton22 and the @SacramentoKings this year.

Fox loves Sacramento. Buddy' Bagley and a 1st or we will just roll with what we have got.@SheaSerrano Sounds like you're looking for a @SacramentoKings playoff run this year!I was told by someone in the @SacramentoKings organization that Marvin Bagley was being heavily shopped this summer and will continue to be heavily shopped. Credit me please! https://t.co/mLbEKxThueI’ve lost a @SacramentoKings hat in the following countries: Costa Rica, Mexico, China and Iceland.  New season, new hat on deck.@kayte_c @MattGeorgeSAC @SacramentoKings @lockedonkings Great episode you two!@MiasDAD19 @SacramentoKings 15 year playoff drought is absolutely horrible for any pro sports franchise. That’s an embarrassment.@TheHoopCentral @excelsm What are we doing @SacramentoKings the guy has averaged 14/7 consistently@J_Santino13 @dmorey @sixers @SacramentoKings They got a Bagley situation . Basically told him he’s a bum until he plays otherwiseIt's actually a bad idea to try experiment in such a game. Do that against sacramento King's or somebody@Etherwavy @saddboykilla Yessir! Sacramento. Nice like Stockton or you up near yuba? For real we need to get the Kings involved somehowYou're only 10 minutes away from you shot to WIN a pair of tickets to see the @sacramentokings take on the @utahjazz at the @Golden1Center! Make sure you're listening LIVE if you want a shot at the prize! https://t.co/xjWgd9XSzh@RudeBoyNYK Yeah but the kings got zero fans outside of tiny SacramentoGood luck this season! @SacramentoKings https://t.co/YVwyFtDzqG@bomani_jones Kings will be Kings. Whether Sacramento, Kansas City, Omaha, Cincinnati or Rochester.Let’s goo @SacramentoKings 💪🏼🏀Great stuff!  Agent rips Kings after Bagley told he won't start: Agent Jeff Schwartz, who represents Sacramento Kings forward Marvin Bagley, issued a rare public rebuke of the team's treatment of his client on the eve of his final season under contract.@SacramentoKings trade buddy while y’all at it@ZacharyWinkler @SacramentoKings @sixers That’s the trade I feel is fair. Of course, throw in a couple firsts.@KristinasCall I can’t remember the last time @SacramentoKings started a season without drama. But I have to say…I agree with this totally! He hasn’t earned his minutes, let those play who have. I’m a STH who is excited for this year!@SacramentoKings You guys need more guards@JPittman2410 @sixers @BenSimmons25 @SacramentoKings @swipathefox @buddyhield @NBA @NBAonTNT @ESPNNBA @NBATV 👀 Sixers would take Fox straight up for SimmonsAgent Jeff Schwartz, who represents Sacramento Kings forward Marvin Bagley, issued a rare public rebuke of the team's treatment of his client on the eve of his final season under contract. 
#NBA #NBATwitter https://t.co/xc1xSX76Tu@zekfromthecreek @SacramentoKings To me, it's cuz they haven't developed the players properly.. some have been busts too, but some have been good. Bad front office that makes questionable decisions is never good. But I'm still here lol.. 9 years now of season ticketsThe @sixers should send @BenSimmons25 to the @SacramentoKings for @swipathefox @buddyhield &amp; draft picks @NBA @NBAonTNT @ESPNNBA @NBATVFree @MB3FIVE fuck the @SacramentoKings niggas is bums https://t.co/Opi4qaQD3jGood luck this season @warriors! If you need a fully vaccinated anthem singer this season, please let me know! (I’m sure the Sacramento Kings won’t mind if you borrow me for a day. 😊) 🏀🎤🇺🇸 #anthemlife #DubNation@excelsm you gotta be the most fucking  clueless agent alive. Got some nerve to be calling out the @SacramentoKings when your client can’t even fuckin play ONE full season of hoops without getting hurt. You just hurt his trade value even more moron😂🤡🤦🏻‍♂️ https://t.co/tiIUCxvGQh@parlayraina I’m a Raiders fan, and a…. Sacramento Kings fan. Lol@expexphillies @SacramentoKings Let's go!!@SacramentoKings Y’all haven’t had a clue for about 20 years. Now you want to leave Bagley out of the rotation. If you wanted to move him, excellent work allowing him to showcase his skill set.@SacramentoKings Give neemy some time!!!@SacramentoKings Kings by 20 let’s get this W !@zewing This is Bagley’s typical MO. Let the agent trash the team while he plays dumb. Kings had a good camp from their standpoint and seem improved. 

Also I strongly believe Bagley’s still a King because Simmons is still a Sixer. He was a part of any deal Sacramento was negotiating..@SacramentoKings make the playoffs https://t.co/wZ12mGNwFL@SacramentoKings let’s get this W tmrw ‼️‼️
