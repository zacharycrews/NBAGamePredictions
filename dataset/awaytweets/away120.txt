Betsson/2 unitsAre there anymore overrated and pathetic teams in the NBA than the Portland Trail Blazers and the Boston Celtics.

Both teams have been awful all year. Damian Lillard sucks now. The Blazers are the Houston Texans of the NBA.Congrats to the winners of the 2021 First Team to Need a Players-Only Meeting award: The Boston Celtics. 

The storied franchise keeps bringing home trophies https://t.co/EFs0ezle1xGame stream: Boston Celtics vs. Orlando Magic https://t.co/7ZIKorCmf4 https://t.co/WGuEMtkVMS #nba #sportsnews #basketball https://t.co/k6NOIqz3U0As a Boston Celtics fan I understand that I do not deserve an iota of happiness. I hate myself, the game of basketball, and most of all the Boston Celtics.I wonder what Tommy Heinsohn would have to say about the Boston #Celtics so far this season.

I'd bet kind words would be few and far between.
