Right? It was on 3/23/2022 if you want to go back and watch it.@KingRio94 @hornets @BrooklynNets @UNC_Basketball Lmfao. Chillll fuck them peacocks all that hype dead today !Charlotte game day 
@hornets beat them @BrooklynNets 

@UNC_Basketball beat them cocks 😂😂 ayooooo@greensboroswarm @PNCBank @GuilChildDev I don't understand why the @hornets didn't bring up Jalen Crutcher this year dude has been a bright spot on the team.@Goated_Himself First off all he got drafted but the nba doesn’t draft him the Charlotte hornets did and traded him to the LakersLarry Johnson. Charlotte Hornets https://t.co/n5ffaSNKQOThe @hornets have a HUGE matchup against the @BrooklynNets on Sunday!

It's also going to be @KyrieIrving's first home game of the season.

Here's the full breakdown on why that's such bad news for the #Swarm: ⬇️⬇️⬇️

Lamelo is a future superstar. Hornets have a top 5 offense but a bottom 8 defense. Just need to work on defense but the future is bright for Charlotte.NBA Basketball Game Betting Picks Simulator: 3/27/2022 7:40 PM ET - Charlotte Hornets vs. Brooklyn Nets - YOU CAN RUN THE GAME SIMULATION FOR FREE HERE: https://t.co/aFN1byuY0x #nba #sportsbetting #freepicks #cappertekDwayne Bacon Charlotte Hornets #thehobby #ad https://t.co/XjcOhYT4UJMan if the Celtics do get the 1 seed in the East and the Hornets find someway to win their way in via the play-in tournament (and get the 8 seed), I will go to game 3 or 4 in Charlotte.

He’s going to be special@hornets see y’all in BK tmr✌🏼@hornetsmuse @Arthurlee_M Another player that should be with the @hornets next season@PaperPrice323 @DJsRawUncutTru1 @hornets Lamelo had a bad shooting month in end of Jan/Feb which tanked his rank… he was top 20 for a long time. Should go back there by the end of the season if he continues like this.@hornetsmuse @Arthurlee_M This young man is special…like really special…and as he adds muscle and strength…@hornets should no longer have a need at C@DJsRawUncutTru1 @hornets offensive numbers really inflated their ranks...If this ranking was accurate the @hornets would've been better than a 9th seed........😂🤣🤣🤣 https://t.co/F62xlx4h1GCheck out 1993-94 Fleer Ultra NBA Charlotte Hornets David Wingate Trading Card  https://t.co/hN2h3ddROa via @eBay #MarchMadness #EliteEight #NBA2K22 #NBATwitter #NBA75 #NCAATournamentCheck out 1993-94 Fleer Ultra NBA Charlotte Hornets David Wingate Trading Card  https://t.co/hN2h3ddROa via @eBay #MarchMadness #EliteEight #FinalFour #NBA2K22 #NBATwitter #NBA75 #NCAATournament@emmmzyne Makes total sense. What about the Hornets? 🙂

Also, I guess Charlotte just got a Major League Soccer team as well this season. That would be interesting to see (evidently they’ve had pretty good attendance so far)

Have a great rest of your weekend 🥂I want Mark Williams on the Charlotte Hornets #NCAATournament #MarchMadness@ryan_mckenna15 @NBA @hornets @MELOD1P @T_Rozzay3 @MilesBridges lakers@allisonbott26 Glad that you converted from lakers to Pels😂. It was fate for me to be a fan of this team, I was a Charlotte hornet fan. Mugsy was on of my favorite players, just due to his size#CharlotteHornets - #UtahJazz 107:101
