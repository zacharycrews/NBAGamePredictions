Don't think Charlotte fans don't notice how this all works...NBA and Silver don't want Charlotte to succeed.

That's why I hope it's a MF blow-out.

@hornets beat them @BrooklynNets 

@UNC_Basketball beat them cocks üòÇüòÇ ayooooo@greensboroswarm @PNCBank @GuilChildDev I don't understand why the @hornets didn't bring up Jalen Crutcher this year dude has been a bright spot on the team.@Goated_Himself First off all he got drafted but the nba doesn‚Äôt draft him the Charlotte hornets did and traded him to the LakersLarry Johnson. Charlotte Hornets https://t.co/n5ffaSNKQOThe @hornets have a HUGE matchup against the @BrooklynNets on Sunday!

It's also going to be @KyrieIrving's first home game of the season.

Also, I guess Charlotte just got a Major League Soccer team as well this season. That would be interesting to see (evidently they‚Äôve had pretty good attendance so far)
