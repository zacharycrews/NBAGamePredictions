 RandleNew York Knicks: 2021-22 Game Thread: 249-Pound Lighter Knicks @ Thunder https://t.co/pwI5Pm89wC@nyknicks Post Jericho@Kevin_DaLegend @hhpthebook @nyknicks Those same starters helped them win the previous cpl of games. Fans think when a guy struggles, unless it's a fan fav, changes have to be made. There's a reason coaches don't do that.2021 was shockingly successful for the Knicks with a 56-46 record in the year heading into a New Year’s Eve showdown at OKC.

So, lets explore the top 10 moments that defined 2021 for the New York team.
https://t.co/Id7NQTf2aP@hhpthebook @nyknicks Obi just returned from Covid &amp; runs A LOT.

The ratio is embarrassing. @nyknicks should delete their account after this tbh@BOSdesurgence @nyknicks @Nas Own them@Trav_Roberts @nyknicks I agree 100%. I'm hoping that's what happens@nyknicks @Nas u use an apostrophe not a quotation mark when putting a quote inside a quote#Sports #TopStories Kemba Walker With Record Christmas Day Triple-Double: Just a week after coming back to the original roster of the New York Knicks, Kemba Walker seems to have cemented his place with a triple-double. We know it would be criminal to… https://t.co/OByK4Lrszl@hhpthebook @nyknicks The team was always in rebuild mode even last year no one expected them to reach playoffs and especially this year as well. They put high expectations on this teamIf nobody got me i know the new york knicks got me https://t.co/FJSYHJQxIkThe #Knicks have major flaws and seemingly no major moves on the horizon. Could we potentially see a lost season in New York? @MattWatling99 https://t.co/0Ou2XjbDB2@hhpthebook @nyknicks This team would of been good with mark jackson at the helm and thibs as an assistant just strictly running the defense only.@nyknicks @KnicksMSGN Kanye did it better https://t.co/UmMvHcZ9ev@nyknicks Making the playoffs!I always criticize Randle just cause I want him to succeed prayers up 🙏🏽🙏🏽@nyknicks@wallyball @BillPidto @RebeccaHaarlow @MSGNetworks @KnicksMSGN @nyknicks Idk why but @BillPidto reminds me of George Costanza #Seinfeld@hhpthebook @nyknicks Oh cut it out!@AsThePoemsGo @nyknicks @MSGNetworks @BetMGM Obi isn’t starting?@ny_knickstalk @JF_Clips @nyknicks @KnicksMSGN yeah they’re just having a kid together, i don’t think they married@barbie_creme @nyknicks @Nas weird and not funny@JackiesOnlySon @nyknicks No, he's not. Covid forced him. Randle was 5 for 20 and played 38 minutes.  Obi played 11. Makes no sense.@Trav_Roberts @nyknicks This team has to rebuild right now. Next year all of these young players will be ready to lead. Remember Jeff Vangundy waited too long to give Camby run.@hhpthebook @nyknicks I'm certain that is not what I said. 8 of their 15 man roster has 3yrs or less w/Mitch &amp; Knox having the most while also being 2 of the youngest. 

My entire pt is saying Thibs needs to play the young guys is ridiculously pointless b/c he already is playing them.@nyknicks @J30_RANDLE To 2019 Randle…@Trav_Roberts @nyknicks I agree. But we actually have skill this year. Deuce can run the point Quick. Grimes and Burks can shoot. Mutch Rimm runner@Trav_Roberts @nyknicks Facts. Who in that starting five scares a team? No one. I think we have stars on this team. Grimes can give you 25 a game. Quick 20, Burks whatever we need. Obi 20 and Deuce 15 with 8 assist.  This is simple basketball.  Run your pick n roll and space out 3 point shooters.IT JUST SHOWS YOU WHO ABOUT KNICKS OR ABOUT SOME BS OF SELLING MERCH OFF THE NAME NEW YORK KNICKS IMMA FIX ALL THAT YOU WATCH https://t.co/AoNVpU7UqT https://t.co/K9SEEpoKDQ@hhpthebook @nyknicks Let the kids play!LIVE ~ New York Knicks vs Oklahoma City Thunder - NBA League Pass

Ya need to establish what type of team this is.I FIND IT COMICAL HOW EVERY KNICKS SHOW ON YOUTUBE WAS IN SUCH A RUSH TO TRADE NEW YORK'S OWN OBI FOR ANYTHING NOT JUST A STAR AND NOW ALL OF A SUDDEN THEY LOVE HIM!! I STOOD ALONE AND GOT LAUGHED AT WHEN I REPEATEDLY SAID OBI STAYS@hhpthebook @nyknicks Run pick n roll with Mitch and let obi run baseline to baseline it’s simple.@hhpthebook @nyknicks Tell thibs that he’s to stubborn to see that he needs to make changes with randle . Randle has no type of post up game. He was given a star title and it went to his head. He’s a great role player nothing more nothing less.@djmrdrummond @nyknicks @J30_RANDLE Thank you@nyknicks @Nas Shoot 'em up, just shoot 'em up, what!@JF_Clips @nyknicks @KnicksMSGN No they not lol@nyknicks Win un ATL@BenRitholtzNBA If Obi don’t start Thibs is getting fired!!! @nyknicks we not playing no games about this and we ain’t having it!!!

Rejoice Accordingly 🙌🏾 

....and happy New Year's Eve 🎩🥂🎉@hhpthebook @nyknicks You folks that put a number on the min each guy should get are hilarious. So Thibs is supposed to say damn the score &amp; time I gotta get player X his 23min. It's comical how y'all think things work. Thibs is going to, &amp; damn sure should, play whoever however many min he sees fit.@Anerdyblackguy @OrinLupe @nyknicks @J30_RANDLE He can’t even make basic mid range shots and his 3 won’t hit. He also gets exposed by double teams 
Has nothing to do with spacing 

Also expectations rise when the money rises@nyknicks @Nas Need a 30 piece from him tonight against the team that waived him@nyknicks @Nas Been going crazy since he's back in rotation.

If Lebron James is a free agent and say New York Knicks need a star baller to bring in new fans to their games, do you think they'd turn down the chance to draft him, if all business protocol allows it?@nyknicks @J30_RANDLE so sad cause i didn’t really get into knicks basketball until this season because i saw they were fourth seed last season. why didn’t i get to watch this julius randle 🥲Today's NBA Consensus (So Far):

(ESPECIALLY THE KNICKS) need to learn how to develop their guys.Remember sometime early in 2021 when we said all New York teams are trending in the right direction?

Giants are a shitstorm
Jets still suck
Islanders suck
Knicks collapsed

So that was a lie.@nyknicks @J30_RANDLE Think twice Knicks Twitter admin. https://t.co/Djk9f7G72YBest way I can describe 2020 and 2021 is the New York Knicks defense on Reggie Miller when he scored 8 Points in 9 Seconds at the end of Game 1 of the 1995 Eastern Conference semifinals to give NYK that L. https://t.co/cuFcV7kSw5@ThePettiestLA Are these people mentally insane 😂 DAMN this is NewYork 🤦‍♂️ such filthy animals over the Knicks, the worst franchise in the last 20 years@nyknicks @J30_RANDLE Plz stop..he barely hustles..can’t set a screen, doesn’t score, isn’t leading the team, it’s like he’s going through the motions.. https://t.co/RoMAVTyV0F@Anerdyblackguy @nyknicks @J30_RANDLE So if you playing the way he playing now you would've asked out?

If this team played pick n roll with Mitch and Obi, they'd be unstoppable.  If Randle would come off the baseline screen he'd average 30 a game, instead he's posting his man at the 3 point line. I played ball@nyknicks @J30_RANDLE nah y’all gotta take the ‘22 season Randle plays outta this@nyknicks @J30_RANDLE Looked like a completely different player last season. Man, what happened@nyknicks @J30_RANDLE Hoping he can get out of his slump. I rag on him a lot, but if he wants to be that guy for the organization he's really going to have to step up post-recovery and stop complaining to the refs after every play.@Yin2K @nyknicks @J30_RANDLE When they mean this yr they mean only last season and some good games this yr💀@Trav_Roberts @nyknicks Also, so that I am clear. The way this team is playing (Right now) where are we going. Every game the starters put us in the hole. We rank 26th in first quarter points. I would like to see Deuce at the point with either Quick or Grimes. We've seen what we have in our starters@hhpthebook @nyknicks I mean Obi is old af@nyknicks @J30_RANDLE Hope he will be this player again next year@nyknicks @J30_RANDLE lmao are you sure?

He’s only made the playoffs 3 times with the Knicks smh but like you said he chose money over winning and had he signed with the Bulls I think they would’ve gone to the finals in 2015. The Bulls that year were 50-32 and lost in round 2@nyknicks @KnicksSavage @TheKnicksWall @sny_knicks I ❤️ Thibs as HC but play the hand dealt. #Knicks squad is DEEP. Run other teams out of the gym.
