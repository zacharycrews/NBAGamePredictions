I was 11 the day David Robinson was drafted and 14 the day he played in his first NBA game.The 82nd and final game of the regular season is coming up on BSSW at 8:30pm. Mavs host the Spurs and w/ a win would sweep a season series from San Antonio for the first time and would end the year 29-12 at AAC, that would be their best home record since the same mark in 2010-11.San Antonio Spurs (+10.5) @ Dallas Mavericks #MFFL #PorVida #NBA #NBATwitter #NBA75San Antonio Spurs Starters:
