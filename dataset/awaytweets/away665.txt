And really the only people truly hurt by it would be season ticket holders not interested in the other teamWhat frustrates me is scrolling through @theScore app and not once in the first thirty articles on the nba tab mention the @memgrizz. It’s like no one in the industry wants to talk about a team like Memphis unless it’s negative.@FordKemba @BuckReising @memgrizz Haha I would imagine with titans they would but not enough NFL home games to do a swap.@mehdidds @memgrizz Love your attitude !!

#GrindCity https://t.co/kWqLSIFugoThe @memgrizz told @JaMorant that he needed to do a 360 degree turnaround, so he did.  😉🤪🥸 360 Layup by Ja Morant! https://t.co/TNMGKeQZue via @YouTube #JaMorantBucks back in action tonight Fiserv Forum with Memphis Grizzlies in town. 

Jrue Holiday is questionable, so he has a shot to play tonight to help contain Ja Morant. 

Desmond Bane &amp; Kyle Anderson are out due to H&amp;S, so that’s a break. 

Let’s hope Bucks get untracked tonight https://t.co/OoIFev5VwBNBA 20/01/22

Watch the performance at  https://t.co/imyhePRdzxIf there was one player in the league I could add to this Memphis Grizzlies squad it would honestly be @Money23Green and I mean that. His style of play embodies everything Memphis is about. He would be a perfect fit.@FordKemba @BuckReising @memgrizz Yeah I feel Memphis would be more hesitant to agree there as Nashville probably has more NBA fans than Memphis has NHL. But I feel it could be a good way, 1 game a year, to spread more and generate some interest.@kuipjak @GrizzliesPR @memgrizz @Bucks My guess is he got it before the season startedBasketball: 'NBA's strongest man' - Steven Adams goes viral after breaking up teammate's fight during Memphis Grizzlies' win over Chicago Bulls, via @nzherald https://t.co/V7vtn30iVh🟢 BUCKS GAME DAY🟢
