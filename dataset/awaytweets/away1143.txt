I couldn't afford jerseys at that age.

I believe everyone started somewhere to become a fan of the team.
Most Lakers fans became fans when Kobe and Shaq were there 
Same for GSW fans when Dub nation were established.

Phoenix's chances of winning a championship are a lot lower than expectation. Boston's chances are a lot higher than expectation.

#NBA #NBATwitter@suns_tutu_fan @Suns I drove 500 miles to watch during the seasons when we won 19 games and I know you were there at that time too lol!@suns_tutu_fan @Suns What’s wrong with being crazy as long as hurting anyone?
I’m on your side✌🏽
This one from the Far East side from you in Tokio🗣We know the Phoenix Suns ceiling &amp; we know the Utah Jazz &amp; Golden State Warriors ceiling. Utah &amp; Golden State have a much higher ceiling than Phoenix. How well your playing at the end of a season is only 1 indicator as to how well you will do come playoff time.

Phoenix Suns -4.5 (-114)

Phoenix is going to be too much for a Warriors team still trying to figure out who they are without Steph. Not to mention CP3 is back.@30reacts @cyanshsharma007 @nj2phx @Suns @warriors @BALLYSPORTSAZ @AZSports @az_mejor We can all expect the suns to win it but in sports there’s no guarantee which mean 100% assurance.

Phoenix Suns

Suns concern is PG depth especially with CP3 having injury problems as he gets older Russ will be in to provide offense with rim pressure playmaking and he’ll have spacing on this team https://t.co/m9Pmn2OzTCIs this the best @Suns team in franchise history? @Saul_Bookman from @PHNX_Sports answers that on @ESPNTucson at 3:25!

Phoenix is the better team and has been playing great as of late winning 8 straight. Warriors are a shell of themselves without Steph. Phoenix may not have anything to play for right now but I think the better team wins this game and covers. -MML🏀NBA🏀

The NBA is always much harder to predict and knowing the Spurs they would draft foreign or have the rook in the G-league 😂why are the phoenix suns not getting the respect they deserve? cp3 gonna have a healthy playoff run and get his ring. they deserve it and their young core is scary good.@Giannis_An34 I’m a Phoenix Suns fan and that block on Embid to win the game triggered my PTSD from the finals last year.

But not enough to be a playoff team and just ignore a top 8 pick for the taking. 

As for the Suns? Don’t forget - they made the bubble - but they went and got Chris Paul that off season! If they don’t do that - no Finals!@BucksAfterDark You know what the actual conversation would be? It would be about if the Phoenix Sun's could repeat as World Champions or not. #34 made sure we aren't having that conversation today...@soy_eloy Are you a fan or just talking? 
Do you remember the @Suns a few years ago in the bubble? I’d say that experience helped them build confidence all while not even making the playoffs. The @spurs started this season with struggles and have really figured out how to playY'all got it all wrong, @DevinBook should have the number 1 spot as MVP... best record in the NBA, he has proven and shown so much growth this year, he deserves it more than anyone else... @Suns @NBATV @espn @SportsCenter @azcsports @BALLYSPORTSAZ @BR_NBA https://t.co/IX5aDrLpMR@celtics What better way to beat the competition than support the @thesunniesnft … @Suns wouldn’t know what to do 👀🔥@espn @SportsCenter @NBA @Suns @DevinBook MVP!!!!!

Not sure what to do with it? 🤷‍♂️@HailMaraTD @Suns Splurge and get club passes!!@chrisdigiusto @Suns FIREE 🔥🔥@levi_connor @Suns @chelseapatel Honestly my dad was there checking other seat options for his season tickets and found them for me.  They are hosting an event tonight.@KnicksLoseAgain The media has never liked the suns. I know I sound biased but there are so many examples of the suns as a team and individual players not getting the credit they deserve, recognition, respect, etc simply because their jersey says Phoenix.@KevinCBryant2 @Jumpshot8 @spurs @Lakers That's fair. Phoenix SHOULD win it all. I think the Suns have the best team. Anything less than a ring this season should be considered a colossal failure. Winning the regular season shouldn't be good enough.@blakekimball @Suns @chelseapatel Who do I need to contact.

☹️☹️😢😢 Hoy estamos fuera de Play In https://t.co/uUOE9HDvmq@Parkland_7 @Suns This season Bruh. Count on it@reccesso @Suns Yeah? How did he do last game?
Oh yeah, 23 yr old Ayton Posterized him. 4/6 of our best players are 26 or younger. We’ll see if the Bucks make it.@Suns Man, I wish I still lived in AZ💜🧡 I have to stick with my @Suns magnet on my TN-plated car🙄@OfficialKappy Phoenix is at least pretty close with the Cards the DBacks and the Coyotes all toeing the line, but those damned rebellious Suns scree it all up.@Suns @mikal_bridges @DevinBook Both me and D Book drive Hyundais. Love it!@Sixers_YB @moc_dude @Suns @LoveAdrxxn To whom? No way@Sixers_YB @jacob_pretzman @Suns CP3 was injured. We’ll see if the Bucks even make it this yearWe taking it this year @Suns 👀 https://t.co/oHPQhsfJf7Just secured @suns half season with @chelseapatel for 2022-23!  LETS GOOOOOOOOOOOOThis is a real question. Why the FUCK isn't @Bell19Raja verified on this mother fucker!? You dumb-dumbs need a reminder?! https://t.co/BuBO7HU2AQ come on #NBATwitter put some respect on this man's name. @Money23Green @therealonesch @BillSimmons @bball_ref @ValleyoftheSuns @Suns@Jumpshot8 @Suns I'm convinced the NBA is embarrassed that the Suns are doing so well in light of the Sarver investigation. They are   not going to promote the Suns and the media have followed suit.@SADVlLLANY @AvgGutsEnjoyer @Suns Donte you expecting good things out fi the franchise that wasted Steve Nash, Amare Stodoumire, Charles Barkley, etc etc is sadThe Phoenix Suns are 9-2 when Cam Payne plays and CP3 does not.  They are 2-2 when neither play.

The Phoenix Suns would still be the best team in the league without CP3 and with Cam Payne healthy.@WildBattleToad @Suns Even if we don’t…@RkyMtnSunDevil @secretlifeofzp @Suns They better do a night parade ! That’d be dope !@ih8snead @Tydozer__ @Suns @mikal_bridges @DevinBook Agree. If they win the title this year, they become the most important jersey in Suns history@Suns trade for PJ tucker pleasee Crowder is so average@CandelariaChano @suns_tutu_fan @Suns_Armband @lindseyrbhair @Tiffany_Lv_SunS @Clifftheusher @PHXMRORNG @Suns Miss you lots raven!@InfinityGTR @Tydozer__ @Suns @mikal_bridges @DevinBook KEEP THEM FOREVER@RkyMtnSunDevil @Suns Same3. No turnovers
- As I mentioned, the Phoenix Suns are an elite defensive team and if we turn the ball over, they will go on a run and blow the game wide open. We need to take care of the ball more because turnovers have been a reason for most of our losses this year.@ih8snead @Tydozer__ @Suns @mikal_bridges @DevinBook They’re losing them after this year anyway. Supposedly they were supposed to not have the Valley jerseys this year too, but they requested to have them one more year@marblekyle @IVIatt_Jones @Suns please consider this instead ⬆️@PlusUltra099 @Suns @StatPaddingBook Is that why we beat ‘em when he was healthy?🤣 “you guys got away with one”NBA Basketball Game Betting Picks Simulator: 3/30/2022 10:00 PM ET - Phoenix Suns vs. Golden State Warriors - YOU CAN RUN THE GAME SIMULATION FOR FREE HERE: https://t.co/znb6qlfZCo #nba #sportsbetting #freepicks #cappertekChanneling some pre-playoff @Suns energy. https://t.co/jztuQyV6pdPhiladelphia 76ers coach Doc Rivers explains why Matisse Thybulle didn’t play much in the loss to the Phoenix Suns.  https://t.co/waCGpckhuv
