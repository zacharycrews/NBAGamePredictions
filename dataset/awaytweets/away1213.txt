I bet that lady pointed at his wrist and asked about it as well 🤭 https://t.co/GsGPFVWYlQ@ThomasAwful @warriors @SFGate @SteveKerr A few good points about @stevekerr being a better motivator then he’s been. Losing more games to bad teams than they should? Fireable? LMFAO. after 50 wins in a season where the big 3 played together once (twice? 🤷🏽‍♂️) c’mon man. Get some rest. 😴@ThomasAwful @warriors @SFGate Why so infuriating? 

1 doesn’t (can’t?) name a better alternative coaching option
 
2 opens door for “firing” @stevekerr even if #dubs win 4th 🏆?!

3 its an article on a major paper w/ a boundary crossing title that reads “jk I love coach &amp; the dubs.” Could beena 🐣 @SFGateCongratulations to bigskybear (@bigskybear) who moved up 1 spot to take #10 on the Golden State Warriors team leaderboard.

https://t.co/W6VN3LlptP@ThomasAwful @warriors @SFGate The only reason I read this is because the title made me mad. I hate the state of media for this. It kills me that @ThomasAwful and @SFGate are making 🪙 every time I reply to this. But they are losing credibility and credibility matters. throwing @stevekerr under the bus…plz@ThomasAwful @warriors @SFGate As it is, this article is just incendiary, clickbait. Caption on tweet is proof. @SFGate should not publish and legitimize this.@NutsackNetwork BREAKING:

Steph Curry (Having a cry session with Will Smith) will officially miss the Golden State Warriors game against the Pelicans tonight.👑🐍🐍👑 BAMBAM AT NBA GAME 🏀

#DubNation @warriors @ChaseCenter https://t.co/EKStCluaUP@ThomasAwful @warriors @SFGate You clearly like the @warriors and @stevekerr and want them to win. You clearly have a dictionary, a decent iq and some 💙💛. Nothing wrong with a hot take. But when it’s a hot pile of 💩 @SFGate should not throw it at the wall. Just 🐣 it with a “what if” and open a dialogue.@ThomasAwful This take is as out of touch with the Bay as Baltimore. You need to get some sleep instead of staying up all night watching @warriors games and writing down your delirious thoughts. Or just post straight to Twitter as open-ended hypotheticals. @SFGate should be better@warriors @BamBam1A And WARRIORS you are the pioneer in making this strategy. Of course, soon there will be other teams to follow. But still can't deny that we are the FIRST 🔥🔥@warriors @BamBam1A And that made me watch basketball for the FIRST time in my life 😆💚
