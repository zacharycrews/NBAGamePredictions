  #betting #Basketball #LA #Lakers #Minnesota #TimberwolvesGame Night.... Los Angeles Lakers vs The Minnesota Timberwolves. Lakeshow 🏀 🏀 🏀 🏀 https://t.co/GLejaQ1KjUThe betting information you need to know from the game between the Los Angeles Lakers and Minnesota Timberwolves.  https://t.co/vsqjInVkSt@ChrisBHaynes @WorldWideWob @YahooSports I pronounce the Portland Trailblazers as the new Minnesota Timberwolves. They will now bare the curse the Wolves had for many years, and it will start by displaying one of the biggest collapses in professional sports history. Rest assured Wolves fans, and Godspeed Blazers fans…Ok. I think I did it. I think I saved the Minnesota Timberwolves. Am I extremely naive or does this actually make some sense?
