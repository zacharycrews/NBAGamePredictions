You can see how the moment and the pressure that comes with it has affected Steph Curry's performance for the past few games.

Get the W pleaseWarriors coach Steve Kerr made it official after shootaround today that Stephen Curry and Draymond Green will indeed now play tonight in Indiana after Golden State had weighed a night of rest for the veteran stars entering a back-to-back set.

Harden averaging this year with the new rule more calls then Curry ever has 😂@mitchyson111 @TravisWayne1 @49ers @SFGiants @warriors @SanJoseSharks @sixers Haha yeah we had a rough night the other night. Steph has been off for the last two weeks I think the record is messing with him. But with Klay and wiseman coming back I feel pretty confident in winning the west. We may just get that Philly and dub finals🤘@sugarkane417 @warriors and Steph Curry most of the time when a defender comes at him lands that way because he has a history with ankles. He just protects them and even last year and after 2017 in general he rarely got calls. Highest ever FT for a season was 6.3 by Steph.
I believe harden has now more@sugarkane417 @warriors That’s not the point or do you believe foul on the 3pt line only is called when you jump into the landing space? 
How players got fouled before 2017 then? 
He jumps clearly into him and if he hits him then it is a foul. Doesn’t matter if he flies by.@dbar9 @NBA @warriors @sixers Guarantee he blocked more shots  and altered more shots than he got dunked on.@NBA @warriors @sixers You know what they say about Apples and Trees.🚨🚨MONDAY BEST #NBA PLAYER PROP🚨🚨

https://t.co/LoVs3QNxHv@warriors Since the focus of opponents defence is on Curry, I believe that this could be a good offence strategy.

It's your ticker agencies. 

A preferential to the louse-out cults.

Gawkers get the seats, and then,

Intimidation of players,
Then ruins the sport altogether.
