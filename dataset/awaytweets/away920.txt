2.🔑 Ball control. Do not turn the ball over.

3.🔑 Time of possession. Use of the clock is your friend. Being on offense and scoring, is better than defense.

4.🔑 “Drive” to the basket.@JandersonSacBee Based on this news, I have my Chevrolet “Like A Rock” keys to a @SacramentoKings victory.

1. 🔑yeah the last nft relating to the sacramento kings worked out sooooooo well https://t.co/Mqdtw5WI2CWell hopefully @SacramentoKings draft Bronny so @KingJames plays in Sac for a year. #Sacramento would go crazy@missionarymelo @warriors I thought I was watching a @SacramentoKings 4th qtr. that was ridiculous@MarkJonesESPN @SacramentoKings Kings lose by 20.This what playing for the fucking Sacramento Kings feels like https://t.co/k5i5dOmdBc@JackCooligan45 Congrats Jack!

Love the fan interaction @MarkJonesESPN.The more I watch Luka Doncic and Trae Young play, the more I realize just how inept the front office of the Sacramento Kings truly is for passing on BOTH of themI’m looking at u, Sacramento Kings fans. https://t.co/VJMdH7Iqga https://t.co/GToMOcPCMUThe NBA wants Dallas to be relevant again so bad… last time I checked the Sacramento Kings have a better roster. Let’s be real. Mark Cuban checks are always paid on time though..@LeGoat03824702 @TBusch23 @statmuse @SacramentoKings I can tell you’ve never watched Hield. You’ll hate him by next season.@keeepsitg @TBusch23 @statmuse @SacramentoKings Both Haliburton and Hield are playing at a higher level than Sabonis.

3. Everyone else

Tyrese and Buddy both playing at a top 20 level since being traded.@slybiri @AngryLakerFan83 That stat talking about the Sacramento Kings cuz and Portland Trail Blazers who we knew damn well was never winning a championship.  Shaq wasn’t having that shit@Lil_DemonsNFT @swipathefox 100% he tweeted me and deleted that he made "only"600k on this project , then deleted it. 
Media need to pick this up
@SacramentoKings @nba #NFTScam #rugpull

Idk how you want me to prove that or why you are doubting I was there but whatever😂@DylanFrew6 @statmuse @SacramentoKings yall got played by the pacers@statmuse @SacramentoKings @statmuse Like that ex that cant get over you.

Hoping for a #KingsFTW!! #SacramentoProud https://t.co/3v0aBIcHn2@statmuse @SacramentoKings pacers won the trade@DylanFrew6 @statmuse @SacramentoKings 6 games for sabonis 
51 games for Tyrese@DylanFrew6 @statmuse @SacramentoKings nice sample size https://t.co/5qNW3A1HKT@btoporek Seriously, though…tell it to the Sacramento Kings. 

The basketball gods gave that city the most entertaining team to talk the Earth and Sacramento angered them and drew a curse by trading Jason Williams for Bibby.@SacramentoKings @ankr How low are we as an organization to go from admiring players like Wayman Tisdale and Chris Webber, to trash bullies like Matt Barnes, such a shame! Even World Peace looks ashamed to be standing there smh@SacramentoKings @ankr The only $ankr we selling is the one holding us to the bottom of the conference! @SacramentoKings@Antonio74607423 @Jari2Fly @statmuse @SacramentoKings Didn’t realize Sabonis is 37 and retiring after the season. You’re a genius! Why aren’t you a GM?@nworawrld13 @cavs @Bucks @SacramentoKings @memgrizz a list why:

- moon dog 
- myles garrett throws out t shirts at the games 
- kid cudi 
- lebron is coming back soon@SacramentoKings @swipathefox @Dsabonis11 The Ox? Y’all cmon please treat Domas better.@SacramentoKings @ankr That’s great. Really. But win a freaking game.@JosjedanM @RANDGRRRIS @IstragaB @crvenazvezda_en Yeah. I feel for him for the loss of his child though. It was nice to see everyone sending him love from all over the region in that moment. But subjective when it comes to Partizan, Real Madrid and Sacramento kings he is not. Amazing passion though :)@statmuse @SacramentoKings PlantationMuse supporting a person of color ???@Slowboidex @MiloEvans5 @SacramentoKings @swipathefox @espn @NBA @shaqtin It’s only right for a poverty franchises best player to keep his fans in poverty. Truly inspirational@KawhisBurnerrr @mox_zi @DylanFrew6 @statmuse @SacramentoKings Spurs still got some good pieces. Poeltl, Devin Vessel, Keldon Johnson, Joshua Primo plus they have 3 first round picks in the next draft they’re rebuilding the right way@SacramentoKings @ankr Sell the team @vivekLast week, the Kings hosted The Future of Tech &amp; Investing: Supporting Black &amp; Diverse Entrepreneurs, presented by @Ankr, a leader in Web3 infrastructure, to encourage young, Black, aspiring entrepreneurs in the Sacramento region. https://t.co/qx6Nz9ct8t
