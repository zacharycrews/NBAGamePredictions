Michael Jordan in his final year with THE WASHINGTON WIZARDS at age 39 didn‚Äôt make any excuses, he went out and played ever single game that season. More players today could learn from Jordan. Right Jeff? https://t.co/1oHo6A7gCEAll of us here at the Washington Wizards management team are happy to announce the starting lineup for the 2022-2023 NBA season. https://t.co/fnE63qFJsaThe Washington Wizards will shortly be announcing their 2022-2023 starting lineup, sources tell ESPN.Washington Wizards were literally a dead organization after Jordan retired the second time. Gilbert single handily give us a second life. It‚Äôs that simple to me. Gilbert had the city on fuckin fire 2003 to 2007. Short run but the impact was insane.üö®ITS GAMEDAY
