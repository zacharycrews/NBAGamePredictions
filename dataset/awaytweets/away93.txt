wine and gold the way it should be. every era represented although the first lebron era could’ve had a better element used than the alternate collar.

the court is okay. doesn’t do anything really. but fair play, cavs. it’s sending me as a warriors fan. 👀 https://t.co/vNQdmwcJmuCleveland Cavaliers: B- 

I really like the shorts on this jersey but I am not a fan of the number being that low with the logo style on top of it. It is almost too hard to read even if the logo is super cool. It is still better than being too simple tho. https://t.co/pfVgxPmKdmCleveland Cavaliers: Breaking down the Collin Sexton dilemma (via @Tony_Pesta) https://t.co/fxZrBrsVOJ🏀 #NBA

The last No. 1 pick to have this type of debut was in 2013, when Anthony Bennett scored two points for the Cleveland Cavaliers. But it’s safe to say Cunningham...Los Angeles Lakers star LeBron James made his NBA debut with the Cleveland Cavaliers 18 years ago. He played against them on the same day.  https://t.co/CWKxUOlFIpCharlotte Hornets vs Cleveland Cavaliers NBA Picks, Odds, Predictions 11/1/21 https://t.co/Fkhjto4Dz7Cleveland Cavaliers 💕
