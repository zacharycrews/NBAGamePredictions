Mo Bamba (sprained right toe) will not play tonight at Charlotte.

#MagicTogetherICYMI: Jalen Suggs is back tonight, while the return of Markelle Fultz looms on the near horizon. Still, the Orlando Magic are a team becoming increasingly defined by absence. 

https://t.co/Tf2D07gQaVICYMI: the Orlando Magic are racing towards the bottom of the standings but still have a couple of players who should figure in the end-of-season award debates. I make the case for both Franz Wagner and Cole Anthony.

 https://t.co/lLP3iwwdKfThe Magic have lost ten straight as they head to Charlotte tonight, but all that matters is the return of Jalen Suggs to the lineup after missing 20 games with a thumb injury.  

How excited are you about the return of Suggs?

#SportsBettingTips #Football #NBAPicks #BettingTwitter #GamblingTwitter #YStatsPicksThe Hornets and Magic entered the NBA during the same wave of expansion between 1988-1989. 

The original plan was for three expansion teams (Charlotte, Minnesota, and Miami). 

After the Orlando group gave a successful pitch to the NBA, a fourth franchise was added to the plan. https://t.co/ymYRhGvaXEIt’s a matchup of two teams headed in different directions as the Hornets are back at the Hive to take on the Magic tonight. 

Charlotte has won 4 in a row while Orlando has lost 10 straight. https://t.co/42Wy4O7mrqBirthday score 🔥 a few of those ratings are too low btw 😏

#NBARooks https://t.co/kvsfMRzPmq@pandahank41 @OrlandoMagic I’m sure they would love to get their overpriced buy price back, but not going to happen!About a month ago, I reported that the Orlando Magic were drawing trade interest for Mo Bamba. 

Today, it is being reported that the Magic are wanting a first-round pick for Bamba. https://t.co/X6wjkbdA2aFormer North Clayton High School and Georgia Tech product Marcus Georges-Hunt has signed a G League contract and will play for the College Park Skyhawks, source said. 

Georges-Hunt previously had stints with the Orlando Magic and Minnesota Timberwolves.@arnaud_vds_ @OrlandoMagic @The_ColeAnthony If you consider every time the player gathers the ball, he gets a gather step, then that means they get 3 steps

If your step is defined by your action when you make the step, it isn't a travel, as his previous step was a dribble step(making shit up now) and he gathered it after@chadfordinsider “No” - all Orlando Magic fans.@arnaud_vds_ @OrlandoMagic @The_ColeAnthony On the step before, he is still dribbling he gathers it between steps so surely the gather step is the one at the 3pt line@OrlandoMagic @The_ColeAnthony All star for coleThe Orlando Magic are reportedly seeking a first-round pick in exchange for Mo Bamba. 👀

I would think he's exactly the type of player Orlando needs and doesn't have. Agree it's not worth discussing since Celtics probably wouldn't trade him anyways.NBA Twitter reacts to the Houston Rockets winning the 1995 NBA Finals against the Orlando Magic. https://t.co/jfujLdD73w@MagicMan816 Reporters be like: This week on Trade Scenarios we analyze trades for teams we like involving the Magic that would make absolutely no sense for Orlando and pretend like Orlando would agree because we’ve never watch the Magic play a game so who cares about what they want.
