Mo Bamba (sprained right toe) will not play tonight at Charlotte.

#MagicTogetherICYMI: Jalen Suggs is back tonight, while the return of Markelle Fultz looms on the near horizon. Still, the Orlando Magic are a team becoming increasingly defined by absence. 

https://t.co/Tf2D07gQaVICYMI: the Orlando Magic are racing towards the bottom of the standings but still have a couple of players who should figure in the end-of-season award debates. I make the case for both Franz Wagner and Cole Anthony.

Georges-Hunt previously had stints with the Orlando Magic and Minnesota Timberwolves.@arnaud_vds_ @OrlandoMagic @The_ColeAnthony If you consider every time the player gathers the ball, he gets a gather step, then that means they get 3 steps

I would think he's exactly the type of player Orlando needs and doesn't have.
