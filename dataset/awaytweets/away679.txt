12 nn @trailblazers vs @celticsI know next to nothing about NBA history much less the @trailblazers. But I acquired this 1978 TRAILBLAZERS desk plaque recently. I do believe that was a division-winning season for them and a run of 42 wins out of 50 games. Were they ever this successful again? https://t.co/XyP3iWYQSl@bball_ref @utahjazz @ATLHawks @MiamiHEAT @chicagobulls @Suns @HoustonRockets @LAClippers @OrlandoMagic @okcthunder @DetroitPistons Top 5 Defensive Rating (DRtg):
