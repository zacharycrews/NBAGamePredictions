Swap the NBA Pistons with the G-league team now. Plus I still haven't watched a Pistons game yet. Jerami Grant will be gone by mid season or after this season. Another good player with no supporting cast.

I understand the value in a veteran presence but it’s just not working. Saben is an instant upgrade!@DetroitPistons @JeramiGrant @CadeCunningham_ @j_josh11 Im trying to root for the kid but Killian Hayes just cant play.  Sorry.

No improvement, undisciplined. Somebody’s got to get fired. Weaver has to step upLuka Garza @DetroitPistons got put on a poster tonight by Jarrett Allen @cavsJust an amazing time tonight watching a franchise altering rookie and also 15 members of the Detroit PistonsSaben Lee has to be better than Cory Joseph @DetroitPistons #Pistons@DetroitPistons get rid of Corey Joseph pleaseIt’s the fourth quarter and y’all only got 60 points?? @DetroitPistons https://t.co/VwAeTvh7gy@gerritt_smith @DetroitPistons @JeramiGrant @CadeCunningham_ @j_josh11 G league team is better@DetroitPistons @JeramiGrant @CadeCunningham_ @j_josh11 Y’all playing horrible.

Not that deep.The Cavs are casually kicking the shit out of the Detroit Pistons.@DetroitPistons @JeramiGrant @CadeCunningham_ @j_josh11 11 point quarter? Luckily they only got 22 but this game is embarrassing after some momentum built against Houston😔@CoreInPain @DetroitPistons @JeramiGrant @CadeCunningham_ @j_josh11 Glad to know you’d be wrong 10/10 times@lazchance @ThonMaker14 bro have your guys call our guys. @DetroitPistons@RyanLaprade @DetroitPistons @JeramiGrant @CadeCunningham_ @j_josh11 Probably true. 😂😂 I’m obviously joking as I loved Cade coming out. Have a good one my man!The Cavs are doing to the Pistons what Detroit recently often did to them. They've flipped spots in the rebuild (Pistons needed to). Cavs have players who have been around the block a few times and it's showing tonight.@BrandonWittrup @DetroitPistons @JeramiGrant @CadeCunningham_ @j_josh11 I know you're trolling, but imagine Mobley trying to maneuver like he does with you in this Pistons team spacing.  He'd be averaging 2/2@DetroitPistons @JeramiGrant @CadeCunningham_ @j_josh11 No thanks@CoreInPain @DetroitPistons @JeramiGrant @CadeCunningham_ @j_josh11 You handed us Goat Mobley by taking fraud Cade.@Becker3434 @_DetroitPistons Playing guys that can't score how u expect to win games Detroit in tank mood how u playing Killian over Saben and Bey 1for10 and Jackson 4for 7 on bench something smell fishy@Celtics__Pats @DetroitPistons @JeramiGrant @CadeCunningham_ @j_josh11 I legit forgot who the Celtics drafted…@DetroitPistons @JeramiGrant @CadeCunningham_ @j_josh11 Fire Casey@Celtics__Pats @DetroitPistons @JeramiGrant @CadeCunningham_ @j_josh11 Are you 12?I know its early but this @DetroitPistons team is not good &amp; @CadeCunningham_ needs to be more aggressive and stop standing around watching so muchGoing in to the 4th and we have 52 points!!!!

#FreeBetFriday@DetroitPistons Halftime thoughts?@mjkara35 @DetroitPistons @JeramiGrant @CadeCunningham_ @j_josh11 Bench and starters go 50-50 makes zero sense.Get this man out of the G league @DetroitPistons https://t.co/tbXt2Q8i6g@DowntownDeuce @EverythingxKing @DetroitPistons @iam_killian Instead of an assist to turnover ratio, Cory Joseph has a turnover to assist ratio😂Game stream: Detroit Pistons vs. Cleveland Cavaliers https://t.co/NichhppWaw@DetroitPistons @JeramiGrant @CadeCunningham_ @j_josh11 Cavs are taking advantage of turnovers unlike the Rockets last game, that’s the biggest difference. Gotta give credit to them, they’re making open shots, contested shots, Allen is a cheat code in the paint and Mobley😳 Gotta tighten up in the 2nd half…@DetroitPistons it is time to call up Lee and let him be the back up on this team! The bench has no one that can create anything but turnovers! Please sincerely ALL #Pistons fans from GREAT STATE of Miiichhigan! https://t.co/ANL4a4O8vB@DetroitPistons @JeramiGrant @CadeCunningham_ @j_josh11 Coach leaves the bench in for 7 mins and an 18-17 lead becomes a 17 point deficit.@DetroitPistons @JeramiGrant @CadeCunningham_ @j_josh11 S/O Killian “Quick Hands” Hayes #Pistons#Cavs team governor Dan Gilbert is in attendance for tonight's game against the Detroit Pistons. He was seen chatting with GM Koby Altman at halftime.@EverythingxKing @DetroitPistons @iam_killian He has almost as many steals at Cory has turnovers52-41 Cavs lead the Detroit Pistons at halftime. Garland has 12 points 3 assists and Evan Mobley became the third fastest rookie in Cavs history to grab 100 rebounds in his career. #letemknow@DetroitPistons @JeramiGrant @CadeCunningham_ @j_josh11 Joseph + 2 Jacksons + Lyles at the same time = disaster...@EverythingxKing @DetroitPistons @iam_killian Probably would have 10 if Joseph didn’t play@DetroitPistons @JeramiGrant @CadeCunningham_ @j_josh11 cut cory joesephKillian Hayes Has 5 Steals already... I think he woke up and chose violence #Pistons #DUP @DetroitPistons @iam_killian@DetroitPistons @JeramiGrant @CadeCunningham_ @j_josh11 This dude is good.

Cade has brought a revitalization to this team. Some of the passing lanes he finds is insane.Cavs sped up Detroit and the Pistons fell apart. Need to keep this up.@DetroitPistons this aint itGet Corey Joseph OUT OF HERE, C’Mon coach Casey. #detroitpistons.@DetroitPistons IS THIS YOUR NUMBER ONE PICK? https://t.co/WVR2SBU8iF@DetroitPistons PSA: Bench CoJo for the love of godHoly shit Corey Joseph sucks @DetroitPistons #Pistons #NBA #NBATwitter*Watching Detroit Pistons* https://t.co/EAdOTTZLcoThe Detroit pistons STINK@noringsforever @DetroitPistons @CadeCunningham_ @j_josh11 @iam_killian It was tied before Cade was benched. Corey Joseph is god awfulDetroit Pistons Lose Kelly Olynyk For Six Weeks Due to MCL Sprain https://t.co/BksxUV5xvWNESN's commentator appears to be mixing up Robbie Stucker (current UVM player) with Rodney Stuckey (a Detroit Piston from a decade ago)This @DetroitPistons team is 🗑 
Can’t control the ball 
Forcing everything 
Horrible offensive scheme that Casey has been running for a decade(the league has it figured out obviously) 
Really disappointing to see how undisciplined they are. Making the Cavs look phenomenal.@j_josh11 is the embodiment of Detroit hustle #Pistons@NBA watching @DetroitPistons vs #cavs and watching the refs call a one sided game. They wonder why they keep losing viewers....smh.@MotownCade @DetroitPistons @CadeCunningham_ @j_josh11 @iam_killian Over@DetroitPistons @CadeCunningham_ @j_josh11 @iam_killian Too many fouls too many turnovers 😓@DetroitPistons @CadeCunningham_ @j_josh11 @iam_killian 10 turnovers in 14 mins . 👌@realChrissyv @DetroitPistons We dat team mane.
