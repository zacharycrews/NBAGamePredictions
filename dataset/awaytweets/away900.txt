If the CP3 to the lakers trade happens in 2011, the raptors do not win the 2019 title. 

CP3 means the lakers don’t trade for Steve Nash in the 2012 offseason

Nash signs with Toronto(rumored at the time)

Anybody that goes into the paint will get doubled because Khem's lack of shooting ability. He's just taking up space. And Siakam is proof of it.
