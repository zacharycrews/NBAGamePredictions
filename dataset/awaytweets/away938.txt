@PlanetFitness of Detroit | #Pistons https://t.co/UUjZr3br9JLet me recap: One of the leading electronic monitoring corps, named SATELLITE TRACKING OF PEOPLE and serving 700+ police agencies, is owned by @TomGores, the owner of the @DetroitPistons. The same guy who made this commitment to racial justice.
https://t.co/Pw4UkvbYUTSTOP was founded in 2004 and acquired by prison telecom giant @SecurusTech (the subject of a future thread) in 2013 for an undisclosed amount. Then, in 2017, Securus was acquired by @PlatinumEquity, which is owned by @DetroitPistons owner @TomGores.@iamsanmii You do know this guy dug up the worst final series of Magic Johnson to sum up his career right, knowing fully well that the man went on to do amazing things and win Championships. This is shallow.
It's like judging Michael Jordan with his losses to the Detroit Pistons
