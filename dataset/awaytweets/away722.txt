In 17 seconds CP3 had:
Turnover
Fouled Russ on 3pt

Game Over

Russ had 38/6/5 while shooting 47% that game as well

Who would want to be that guy.🎙️ On the call for @Suns at @utahjazz later tonight at  10 p.m. (ET) / 8 p.m. (MT) on @ESPNNBA.

⏰ : 10:00 PM1/26/91 – The Phoenix #Suns signed former number one overall pick, center Joe Barry Carroll. Carroll appeared in 11 games for Phoenix, never reaching double-digit scoring or rebounding, and following his being waived in October of that year, retired from the NBA. #ValleyProud https://t.co/u6LRaoNXjN1. Kareem: 38387
2. Malone: 36928
3. LeBron: 36414 (514 points back)
LeBron needs about 19 more games to pass Malone.
Best guess for passing Malone is at Phoenix Suns on 03-13-2022 at 9:00p

He'll pass Kareem in 67 games which would be around Dec 23, 2022.With Deandre Ayton out and Bismack Biyombo or JaVale McGee playing center, the Suns are undefeated so far this season:

If Zed Phoenix told me the sun was going to rise tomorrow, I'd stay up so I could see it for myself, I have that little confidence in anything that lying shitsack comes out with.@jalapeno_zesty @NScoolis @WardelWilsonSZN @hayescarroll_ @warriors @Suns The best part is Lebron is the only one of their “big 3” that had a positive plus minus. Their backups outplayed the Nets third string and that’s pretty much the story of the game.@hayescarroll_ @warriors @Suns AD has 10 games before he's Street Clothes Davis once again. Also no KD last nightConsensus Line Move:
