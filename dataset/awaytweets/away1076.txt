Not sure that you're giving the kid enough credit here. He's now excelling in the role that he's built for which is finishing plays.@Jlewicki17 @celtics Ainge did a good job drafting. Underrated.The second year (2022-23) of Malik Fitts' contract with the Boston Celtics is non-guaranteed. It becomes $50K guaranteed if he's not waived by 9/1/22, then fully guaranteed on the league-wide date in January of 2023.

In the playoffs there's a day of rest between each game. The Jay's are playing 36 and 34mpg now. In the playoffs starters always play more. And they're more than capable of doing so. White plays the backup wing spot and he'll be more than capable. Not really a problem.The Boston Celtics are 40-14 when they finish with more than 20 assists in a game

Sometimes it's not complicated@bucknersrevenge @Celtics_PRam @celtics Esp w/ the ability to create their own shot.

Just wow. #BleedGreen #NBA@bucknersrevenge @Celtics_PRam @celtics He’s had great decision making what I implied is that JB hasn’t been awesome under those circumstances and they could use more people with proven playoff experience that can step up when that happens as well@bucknersrevenge @Celtics_PRam @celtics Never said that lol. Read it again. Your argument was actually hella random tbh@celtics Joker went, nah im not being postered@Celtics_PRam @gustavozbarbosa @celtics The part I don't think is "factual" is the part where it's stated that Tatum hasn't handled traps well. Save for the Dallas game, he has handled them very well for the last 2 months. We are a Top 10 offense now despite Tatum continuing to draw doubles. That was my point there.1/2@celtics @jaytatum0 @FCHWPO The Celtics have gone 21-4 since 1/21/22!

What a heck of a turn around!  This is the Celtics team everyone expected to see at the beginning of the season. Thankfully, they finally showed up!

Seems to care more about LA teams now. With days off between games in the playoffs and the opportunity to make adjustments and have the Jay's play 40 minutes a night their play will have the biggest impact.I've been a season ticket holder since '93. When they were bad they had 17 fans there when they traded for Garnett they had 7,000.

And by the way, those other teams have to play us too. Ya know, the team with the #1 defense.Really difficult closing schedule, but the @celtics are playing really well. I’ll take a 6-4 final 10 games gladly. As long as we avoid the play-in, I’ll be satisfied https://t.co/i4oJJNcl5h@gustavozbarbosa @Celtics_PRam @celtics Yeah I'm not buying that. An additional shooting specialist off the bench is not gonna be the difference between a championship or not. That's not how this league works. That's not what the history of this league is. If a team finds a way to stop Tatum, THAT is what will stop us.BOSTON CELTICS WIN BABYYYYY ☘️💚 Y LOS RAPTORS LE GANAN A LOS SIXERS JOJOJOJOJO@bucknersrevenge @Celtics_PRam @celtics Although Pritchard has been really nice, we don't really know what to expect from him come playoff time. We could definitely use J Rich though. There will be stretches that the lack of shooting will be extremely evident@celtics C'mon Celtics this could be our year!!@bucknersrevenge @Celtics_PRam @celtics playoff defenses are different, you can really fine tune and zero in on what you want to take away and in the Celtics case JB still hasn't been great whenever a team traps Tatum. We will miss more people that can both spot up and create their own shot under those circumstances@MrGIF4479 @celtics @Eintr8Eisbaeren Lets goooooo🥳@bucknersrevenge @Celtics_PRam @celtics Yep. I think we're gonna get real close but when push comes to shove we are going to miss an extra player (that can shoot) with proven playoff experience. Dallas has laid out the blueprint on how to trap Tatum, and we still have trouble when a team does that@gustavozbarbosa @Celtics_PRam @celtics ??? You think the difference between us winning a title vs not is Josh Richardson?

And no, it's not just because they have the hero of Gotham. 

That defense is elite. I have concerns about the lack of a true PG. But overall, look out.

We can defend anyone we have the fire power to go deep and the Star power to win 7 game series. And if Tatum can play the way he has been we have the MVP to win it all@celtics Who’s ahead of ray?The @celtics came out tonight like. https://t.co/MH4VGwyr60@dpshow Bulletin Dan: Boston Celtics best team in the East.

Kings of the Commonwealth, and the NBA as it stands today.@georgew11998555 @celtics No shit Sherlock but thanks for agreeing with me.This @celtics team is ridiculous! They just dismantle teams like its nothing@Broncomaniac58 @celtics @jaytatum0 Yep, he is pretty much unstoppable driving to the hoop and from the outside and has been for about 2 months. Also pretty good defensively!! His slow start to the season probably cost him the regular season MVP but maybe he can get The NBA Finals MVP!!!! Ha!!The Boston Celtics are going to the NBA Finals. They're the hottest team in the NBA. Barring injury, they can win it all. 

Brooklyn is not even making the playoffs.@celtics MVP on my books@celtics Is he #2 on Celtics made threes now?@celtics We need a celtics Twitter spaceLets get it, win it and claim it @celtics 
#BleedGreen https://t.co/eirL8pd94w@BroncoRob @celtics I’ve had plenty of bad takes over the years, but I always preach patience. The last season and a half wasn’t fun but Tatum and Brown are special. They had so much success early they were bound to fallback. I can’t wait for the playoffs.
