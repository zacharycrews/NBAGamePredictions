#NBA #NBATwitter https://t.co/R9ZEsCQbuh@ReganDuckworth @utahjazz @rudygobert27 I agree 100%. MJ should have won MVP 10 years in a row for obvious reasons but that’s how it works.Just watched an @espn piece on the @utahjazz and a college scholarship program they started for high school seniors around Salt Lake City. Awesome job by the owners of the Jazz and the organization. Enjoy seeing those stories about difference makers in society. https://t.co/XSYQE2mXB3@SaltCitySwagger @utahjazz @rudygobert27 It’s kinda an honor that Rudy has reached this point in his career: so much better than everyone else that they have to give it to someone else because he’s won it so much. Dumb, for sure, but not unprecedented with awards like this.LET'S GO! #utahjazz #TakeNote #PlayoffsxFanficsSmart is a good defender for sure. I’m admittedly a @utahjazz Jazz homer, but with all the analytics available, this is voter fatigue and some real horse 💩. @rudygobert27 impacts the game defensively more than any one else, period! #TakeNote https://t.co/3drXEceMR9Watch NBA Playoffs Live Stream Online for Free

You can tell Mitchell doesn't even like passing him the ball 😂@DLocke09 @NBA @utahjazz @ZoneSportsNet @kslnewsradio That’s was about 1,000,000,000 times better than the TV call on TNT. SVG seemed very unprepared for the game (energy and insight). Nice work 👏🏽👏🏽@utahJAZZ__ 😭 I literally just turned my heat back up to 76Voter fatigue or not, Rudy Gobert is the DPOY. 

Even if you wanted to give it to Smart or Bridges so bad because you hate Rudy or the Utah Jazz, you still can’t deny him the award. 

4X. He’s about to be tied with Mutumbo and Wallace for the all time lead.@synders_plug @utahjazz @44Bojan @hulu 11 threes incoming 🚨#UtahJazz #Jazz PG-SG Trent Forrest (foot) is out for Monday's Game 2. He is week-to-week. https://t.co/ozVt459dbBUtah Jazz vs Dallas Mavericks 

In their first game, Maverick’s defense was A1. However, that didn’t matter as Utah’s offense was on fire - finishing with the W.

- 20 rebonds@UtahJazz_France @dearbball 8 points 14 rebondsOne of the keys to both the Utah Jazz’s Game 1 win and going forward, both Mike Conley and Bojan Bogdanovic said, is players sublimating their egos and continuing to sacrifice for the good of the team.

idk how you can look at that pic and tell me with a straight face Smart should be the DPOY…Only three other teams have grabbed at least 25 offensive rebounds in a 21st century playoff game: the Utah Jazz (2008) and Los Angeles Lakers (2000, 2002). Historically exposed flaw Phoenix will need to fix moving forward.@BoJoe244 @EccoJones @NBATV @Suns @utahjazz @celtics @mikal_bridges @rudygobert27 True, but JJJ should be over both Bridges and Smart@DanuelHouseJr @utahjazz Thanks man!!! We love having you on the Jazz, you always play with heart!@jport514 @utahjazz He fresh!!!Dallas Mavericks 93 - 99 Utah Jazz 
Memphis Grizzlies 117 - 130 Minesotta Timberwolves

Golden State Warriors 123 - 107 Dennver Nuggets@utahjazz @DanuelHouseJr I don't just like the attitude, I love it!@utahjazz @rudygobert27 He should get it again, he is a 3x All-star primarily cause of his defense.@JStudman0143 @BoJoe244 @NBATV @Suns @utahjazz @celtics @mikal_bridges @rudygobert27 It picked that stat out cause it’s what most people have been using against Smart. Also it’s the stat that shows the biggest discrepancy(outside of Defensive rebounds because that’s Timelord’s job). It’s not an argument, it’s a discussion. I love that the NBA has both of them.The Dallas Mavericks likely will be without star Luka Doncic in Game 2 of their Western Conference first-round series against the Utah Jazz on Monday, ESPN reported. #NBA | @Reuters https://t.co/T4FUDJ5Tmn🚨WINNERS🚨 I decided to choose 2 winners for this first giveaway!

im wheezing https://t.co/QPw5WqzD47@jayfrmdaak @BrandonGomex47 @utahjazz @rudygobert27 You honestly think 6'3" Marcus Smart can guard 1-5?

He's effectively playing defense on 7 ft NBA PF's and C's??

The answer is no. No he's not.@_MAC_III_ @NBATV @Suns @utahjazz @celtics @mikal_bridges @rudygobert27 Not only voter fatigue- they know if they do, it cements him as a HOFer. They ain't ready to admit that yet.Congrats, Utah Jazz.

The play in is not the playoffs i asked if that formula beaten the golden state warriors and your answer was they beat them in 1 play in game. You just proved my point. When you get in the playoffs you rely on your stars@Jazz22Uta @utahjazz Maybe even make a move for Zion if he becomes available via sign &amp; trade. Gobert, Zion &amp; Mitchell or Gobert, Ingram &amp; Mitchell either one of those big 3 would be favorites to win a 🏆 in my opinionWe always need to make a @utahjazz egg when we decorate Easter eggs. Go Jazz! https://t.co/otCCSOdl6pThe Phx Suns are the new Utah Jazz back when Karl, John and Jeff kept getting to the finals and blowing it watch!@utahjazz @rudygobert27 The real ones know. He is a defensive marvel. The stats on him give him a great case as the greatest defensive player of all time. It's sad how bad the rest of the jazz are defensively.@BuckleUpBoler @utahjazz Boler, anybody who knows anything bout hoops, knows Rudy is the greatest defender this league has seen in at least 20 years. I’ve been watching since the mid 70s and RG is a Top 5 defender, ever. He should win DPOY but probably won’t because of voter fatigue@FieryBlazeNew @utahjazz He is done and I am a mavs fan. Congrats on the series. Good luck rest of the way@esensten @utahjazz Yeah, I’d be happy to chat. I’d love to know the answer to this.5 teams I hate:
1. New York Knicks
2. Denver Nuggets
3. Philadelphia 76ers
4. Memphis Grizzlies
5. Utah Jazz@Jazz22Uta Lol you're a pretty cool guy dude &amp; the @utahjazz has a pretty good squad. They can't blow that team up but if they added a Brandon Ingram to be SF with keeping Mitchell &amp; Gobert for a big 3 &amp; a solid bench/role players they would definitely be competing for a 🏆Flying to France on Saturday during @utahjazz game 4.

The record that will never be broken is fewest points in an NBA Finals game: 54, Utah Jazz, game 3 of the 1998 NBA Finals.@christianfozza3 @utahjazz @rudygobert27 Jfc lol you said “he (Smart) gave up 18 points to Kyrie” how tf am I suppose to interpret that 😂@HooliganDuck @utahjazz @rudygobert27 so you can’t understand context or read between the lines? yes obviously kyrie didn’t score all 18 only on smart. that’s obvious. i guess not for you though.The Phoenix Suns are “very probable” to start the Playoffs 8-0 with series sweeps 🧹 over the Pelicans and Utah Jazz.
The Jazz are so beatable and mediocre this year and the Dallas Mavs would’ve beaten Utah in 5 or 6 games with a healthy Luka Doncic
Suns cruise to the West Finals@christianfozza3 @utahjazz @rudygobert27 Hmmm interesting https://t.co/Zkzp3g13cMOur lead star and scorer is a guy who ain’t shy of passing the ball especially to his big man…Utah Jazz can’t relate. Gobert would love to play with Booker@HooliganDuck @utahjazz @rudygobert27 no i said that kyrie scored 18 in the 4th quarter and that the nets offense was focused on having smart switched onto kyrie.What's going to be the best first round match up in the west? @NBA #NBA @Suns @PelicansNBA @memgrizz @Timberwolves @dallasmavs @utahjazz @nuggets @warriors@christianfozza3 @utahjazz @rudygobert27 Aren’t you the one that said Smart gave up 18 points to Kyrie?

Why do The @utahjazz have to find ways to make me not hate them!? This is so cool! Classy move, Jazz and congratulations to the recipients! https://t.co/H6aUpw6GqY@christianfozza3 @utahjazz @rudygobert27 Because there’s more to defending outside of that. How about pick and roll defense? How about iso defense? How about being to slow to close out on a shooter? He’s a liability in those areas.@HooliganDuck @ZingOZang @utahjazz @rudygobert27 wanna try again? https://t.co/NSN6CVd38YGoes for Utah Jazz fans as well. https://t.co/jPL6XClX9p@HooliganDuck @utahjazz @rudygobert27 How can a playoff series impact the award of an other regular season?@christianfozza3 @ZingOZang @utahjazz @rudygobert27 Lol what?! Think about what y’all just said. Royce is their best defender outside of Rudy, I agree. So knowing that, why would teams purposely run offensive sets that include Rudy? Because they know he can’t defend on the perimeter. And that’s who y’all say should be DPOY 🤦‍♂️@HooliganDuck @utahjazz @rudygobert27 then said you don’t know why he’s in the running for dpoy 😂 that is such an ignorant statement@ZingOZang @HooliganDuck @utahjazz @rudygobert27 exactly lol. this guy watched one possession where they scored on governor and decided he’s a trash defender 🤣@christianfozza3 @utahjazz @rudygobert27 Dude I literally acknowledged that he’s an elite rim protector@HooliganDuck @christianfozza3 @utahjazz @rudygobert27 They don’t seek out Gobert lol. They seek out Utah’s weak perimeter defenders. Only one player, Royce, is an above average defender outside of Gobert@HooliganDuck @utahjazz @rudygobert27 well except they don’t…because he’s won the award three times now and is a finalist for the 6th straight year. it seems like the majority think different than you. i think that’s for a reason@jayfrmdaak @BrandonGomex47 @utahjazz @rudygobert27 Bam is a better defender then Smart - he also guards 1-5 more often then Smart does@HooliganDuck @utahjazz @rudygobert27 do your own research. you didn’t even watch the game, don’t talk like you know what happened. this also shows your cherry picking of only the bad things with gobert.@Void_Existence_ @G0at1337_ @utahjazz @basketusa @rudygobert27 Lmao he’s a mavs fan just dreaming of the news that they’re interested in him@christianfozza3 @utahjazz @rudygobert27 Let me guess on one possession and you somehow think that makes him DPOY?@jayfrmdaak @BrandonGomex47 @utahjazz @rudygobert27 Smart ain’t the DPOY. If the you think he is you have falling victim to the narrative being forced on you. Rudy is and will be until he is not in his prime the DPOY!@HooliganDuck @utahjazz @rudygobert27 yeah and that height and wingspan is generational because i don’t see anybody else with such elite rim protecting. and yeah they are playing without luka, but when luka did play against the jazz, gobert locked him up. do you remember that?@HooliganDuck @utahjazz @rudygobert27 well considering the dpoy is a regular season award, you le argument is once again invalid. you can try again thoughThe Phoenix Suns will sweep the New Orleans Pelicans and the winner of the Dallas Mavericks/Utah Jazz.@christianfozza3 @utahjazz @rudygobert27 I mean the Mavs are playing without Luka. He’s their offense. Can break the defense down, score in isolation, and seeks mismatch’s which all are Rudy’s weakness. So I expect him to dominate. 
And he’s a generational rim protector.* He’s 7ft with damn near an 8ft wingspan.@christianfozza3 @utahjazz @rudygobert27 And I mean his defensive liabilities on the perimeter are a significant reason why they lose in the playoffs. I can’t just overlook that for a DPOY candidate. That’s not hating. That’s a valid reason@AntoineCarr55 @Mavs @utahjazz @rudygobert27 @spidadmitchell @youngwhiteside @KelennA7 @RudyGay @DanuelHouseJr @JordanClarksons @NickeilAW Hell yes big dawg@utahjazz Without Luka@cougar_reg @MiamiUte9 @BrandonGomex47 @utahjazz @rudygobert27 My vote would go to Giannis but thas jus my opinion@RyanQualtrics &amp; @utahjazz .....

You wanna call me a hater, fine. You look like a Gobert Stan right now. Answer a simple question. How can a DPOY be the player teams want to seek out and attack? How can he be the player teams want to run screen sets on and iso on?Prediction: #utahjazz will take Game 2 by 15 or more. Mavs game best shot minus Luka in opener and Jazz had woeful shooting day. They’ll roll on Monday night.@ChaddPhil @utahjazz @rudygobert27 Congrats to them on barely beating the Mavs.. who’s entire offense revolves around Luka 👏@cougar_reg @MiamiUte9 @BrandonGomex47 @utahjazz @rudygobert27 If you watched the game a lot of kyries points was off a screen and pull up, pull up jumpers, easy layups but you can say tha🤷🏾‍♂️@HooliganDuck @utahjazz @rudygobert27 he’s won the award 3 times…you think that’s just pure coincidence? he’s not elite in just one category. the fact you think that is pure comedy. typical gobert hater with no facts to back yourself up.@HooliganDuck @utahjazz @rudygobert27 Boy he played well last night. Best player on floor. But when the playoffs start, oh...wait...@G0at1337_ @utahjazz @basketusa @rudygobert27 Then who do the Jazz deserve?

He's just better skilled at preventing shots all around@christianfozza3 @utahjazz @rudygobert27 I’m sorry but being elite in one defensive category doesn’t outweigh his other liabilities enough to make him DPOY.

Rudy is comfortable on the perimeter, specially on iso situations. +, he isn't a shot blocker, he is more of a contester than anything, being pretty movable to avoid infiltrationsThe Saturday @usfl game had better TV Ratings than the @dallasmavs vs. @utahjazz game!...WOW! #USFL #USFLOpeningWeekend #NBAPlayoffs2022 @NBAIs West Prone for Major Upsets? https://t.co/c6qFqQ6F9G #UtahJazz #DallasMavericks@HooliganDuck @utahjazz @rudygobert27 he also just held the mavs to 5-16 shooting. that’s his speciality. you don’t see draymond, kawhi, and bridges providing elite rim protection. you not seeing the value and impact of gobert as a defender shows how much of a casual you are.@BuckleUpBoler @utahjazz It's not even close! 4XDPOY 💪✨️ https://t.co/Zu2W9RQN3l@utahjazz @rudygobert27 4th incoming 🔮 https://t.co/E3NIyTpwFa@christianfozza3 @utahjazz @rudygobert27 My criticism for Gobert is because teams seek him out, attack him &amp; put him in a position to defend outside the paint. You never see teams purposely seek out Draymond, Kawhi, Bridges. That’s why Gobert still being considered as a DPOY is mind blowing to meUtah Jazz ain’t ever gon win shit #veryshittyfranchise@utahjazz Thats more nominations than Ben Simmons for ROTY#GoldenStateWarriors Memories of years past were revisited in Saturday’s thrashing of the Utah Jazz. While only one game, the glimpses of the defense illustrate the potential to revisit a championship trophy!@utahjazz @rudygobert27 Congrats.@HooliganDuck @utahjazz @rudygobert27 your situation wasn’t even correct. they expected gobert to defend the paint and perimeter because all other defenders were useless. that’s a team problem, not a gobert problem. and yes i obviously know that, but their plan was for kyrie to literally switch onto smart to score@utahjazz @DanuelHouseJr I've always been a fan of House since his Houston days. Glad he's with the Jazz.@christianfozza3 @utahjazz @rudygobert27 Not even a similar situation. You’re comparing one game to an entire series/postseason. And you realize Smart didn’t defend Kyrie every possession in which he scored right@NBATV @Suns @utahjazz @celtics @mikal_bridges @rudygobert27 Rudy is the best defender in the league and it’s not even close.@utahjazz @DanuelHouseJr I love this man, he’s just pure and I hope he can make a good long stand with the Jazz.
