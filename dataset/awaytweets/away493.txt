Backing BOS here against an undermanned MIN team. BOS have won 9 straight against MIN and face them without KAT, Dlo, Ant and Pat Bev. Even without Tatum and Smart, I think BOS have to much talent today.

Great phrasing lol@gauravsabnis The 60s Boston Celtics came pretty close to doing it in the 60s. They won 9 out of 10 rings that decade.

Wilt Chamberlain averaged 50 points a game and didn’t win MVP (Bill Russell). He once grabbed 55 rebounds in a game against the Boston Celtics. During a playoff against the Celtics he averaged 50 pts and 29 rebounds &amp; lost.
