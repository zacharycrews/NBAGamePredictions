Houston Rockets’22 NBA offseason trade the LA Lakers need to consider is Russell Westbrook, THT, &amp; their ’27 RD1 pick to the Houston Rockets for John Wall and Eric Gordon. Honestly, the Lakers should’ve pulled the trigger on this deal at the 2021-22 trade deadline #NBA@Juulsman @JalenGreen @NBA @HoustonRockets I already know! But, there were a lot of “Rockets fans” who have counted him out already and he’s only a (20 yr old) rookie. Have to give players 2-3 years to get accustomed.
