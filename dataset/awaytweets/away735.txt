Right or wrong, Randle feels mistreated and disrespected by fans and that is fueling all this seems like.

He started a war he can‚Äôt win.

That aside, there seems to be friction overall.

Thibs is not the best in terms of ensuring chemistry.New York Knicks Open To Trading Kemba Walker, Evan Fournier and Alec Burks #NewYorkForever #NBA #NBATwitter #NBATwitterLive #KembaWalker #EvanFournier #AlecBurks
