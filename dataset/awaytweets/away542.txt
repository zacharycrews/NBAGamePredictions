Congrats to both!The CSG Card of the Day is out of this world and so is the play of Ja Morant! Known for his dynamic scoring and play-making skills, the Memphis Grizzlies’ point guard is showcased in this 2019-2020 Panini Spectra Celestial RJA card graded CSG 9.5 with a 10 for the autograph. #CSG https://t.co/8FEqvMtii2@counter_econ @NBAPR @memgrizz @chicagobulls I’m not mad about Ja he balled out this week.
BUT that player of the month better be in LA with number 6 .The @memgrizz have a win against every team they’ve played except for 3: The Hawks, Wizards, &amp; Pelicans They’ve played each only once &amp; all 3 have .500 or lower. They are third in the league based on this stat. The @warriors have 2 &amp; the @Suns have 1. #PlayoffsLookGoodForGizzLooking for a value bet?

Great job Coach Jenkins!!!@chocothunda901 @memgrizz No arguments here. Dude is about to give the league FITS for years to come.@shaqqytoodope @memgrizz 20 years and the right people is enough time to bust moves. The new front office changed the mistakes of 20 years in 3 seasons so the right people matter more than time. We just need to keep Ja in the fold and give home help.@chocothunda901 @memgrizz I hope so. I was sick about that shit myself bc the Bulls were ASS at the time so I was only watching y'all. I remember wasting my drink finding that shit out@shaqqytoodope @memgrizz We can be happy with the state of the Grizzlies now because of the mistakes of the past. Signing that boy was dumb but It won’t ever happen again.@chocothunda901 @memgrizz -the smallest chance of getting any Free Agenr stars is NUTS. Ja GON' bring somebody to this mf.@chocothunda901 @memgrizz Y'all been here 20 years. That's enough time to bust moves bruh 😭 

BUT you're definitely right on track small market argument. Memphis is my team when CHI doesn't play sink really ain't giving y'all no shit lol. The fact that y'all can do this pretty much knowing y'all have@shaqqytoodope @memgrizz And Bulls fans should be proud of that move. I guess have 56 years of experience pays off🤷🏾‍♂️. We just got in the game so we’re going to make mistakes and WE both know that we probably won’t get free agents to sign in Memphis unless a premium is paid.@MarcEverette @memgrizz @Titans It has that Memphis vibe all over it.@egrishom @GrizzliesPR @memgrizz @BrooklynNets Just since 12/26. None of us have any sense of time anymore I don't think. I had to look it up.@Titans Y’all really should work 3-6 Mafia’s Who Run It into this promo. @memgrizz  introduce them to @DJPAULKOM 🔥🔥🔥@flstudiooo @memgrizz @JaMorant summrs@memgrizz @JaMorant This one looks better https://t.co/Z5oRuK1kEg@isipsizzurpp @memgrizz @spurs Was the same with Rudy gay Marc gasol Mike Conley and Zac Randolph. Wasted their careers. Didn’t do too much with them. Ja is good. Don’t do that with him.@chocothunda901 @memgrizz And we made up for hiring Hoiberg in one season. ONE. SEASON. Bruh. We went from cellar dwellers last season to top of the conference/league the very next season. 

We did a front office revamp just like y'all. We just made it, arguably, pay a little better. 😎@stillpos @Ifitsupthen @memgrizz @Titans @JaMorant U not cause if u were sorry u wouldn’t have done it https://t.co/qtV2oDbopW@memgrizz @Titans @memgrizz 🔥🔥🔥 I know y’all were at the Titans game a few weeks ago. Y’all gotta be helping with the promo. ✊🏽@shaqqytoodope @memgrizz Different front office. Totally different people.
