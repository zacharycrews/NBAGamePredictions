Lukas' extension is going to kick in and we have giant untradeable salaries like KP and Hardaway. There's almost no point in even having a GM right nowEvery night I wonder how @mcuban @dallasmavs really passed on @DBane0625 @TCUBasketball @TCU  …. https://t.co/Ffh1FlMWiB.@luka7doncic's sensational play is a major reason why Mavs games are always fun to watch! 💫

Hey @jjbareapr how about some @dallasmavs 🎟… btw it’s 80 out tomorrow (for my Michigan family and friends) https://t.co/QjcGuob5ZBI can't believe we bought season tickets to the @dallasmavs this year. I'm getting 50% off emails now because they apparently can't *give* tickets away fast enough. Maybe it's not the Twitterverse that has the dumb Mavs fans, maybe it's the ones paying for a full season @mcuban"coulda played for the dallas mavericks but they found crack in my jacket" https://t.co/Ud2xGUGpyM@LavineBurner The question is what assets do the Dallas Mavericks have?@dallasmavs But how does kidd know or even Moses knows he's not going to play when we have trash centers and should be plenty opportunity 💁🏽‍♂️@dallasmavs @feronhunt11 @TexasLegends That’s my friend Feron!!@dallasmavs 1.Moses
