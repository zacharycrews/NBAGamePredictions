As the short-handed @okcthunder takes on the reigning NBA Champions Milwaukee Bucks at Paycom Center tonight at 7 pm CT on Bally Sports Oklahoma and on the radio side @TheSportsAnimal(98.1 FM(OKC)). #ThunderUp2 years ago I took my kid to go see the Pacers play the Bucks in Milwaukee. A couple weeks later the lockdowns happened. On what will be almost the two year anniversary of the lockdowns, I'm taking him to see the Bulls play the Bucks in Milwaukee.@TCOWrld Agree, Celtics are def better than Chicago. But I think teh 3 best teams in the east are Milwaukee, Miami and philly. Bucks and heat are most complete teams and they’re 1 and 2. Philly has a great duo but many obvious holes like bad defense and lack of depth. Celtics are 4th 👌@TCOWrld Nah it’s cuz I saw Celtics Twitter saying they can beat Milwaukee and Miami in a series. Bucks have 3 scoring options and Miami has like 6It is my preference that the NBA Champion Milwaukee Bucks win tonight. 

This is the Way.
