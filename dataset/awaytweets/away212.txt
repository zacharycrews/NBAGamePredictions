Lamelo Ball for Kemba 
then a rookie from the wizards for Simmons so that there could be a duo in Washington with Kuzma 
the New York trade is just because I would really want kemba back in NC like the return of Cam / Kemba@WashWizards Game at 7:00pm vs @hornets!
My 3 Predictions:
-Bradley Beal will score 30+ points and have 6+ assists 
-Deni Avdija will score 10+ points and have 8+ rebounds
-Kyle Kuzma will make 4 or more 3 pointers
