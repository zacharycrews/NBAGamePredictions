Have fun on 2/2!@rloewe65 @lovethatdude @mcuban That’s great to hear. I’ve always liked him in his capacity of the owner of the Dallas Mavericks. He’s interesting on Shark Tank too, but based on this I have a great amount of respect for him as well. Using his platform to help others is what it’s all about. #compassionDallas Mavericks and Los Angeles Lakers are gonna cause a huge wave of top 4 tanking toward the end of the season. #NBATwitter@BallySportsSW @dallasmavs @luka7doncic Great interview..the Mavs need him..He does play every game to win Luka puts everything into the game..@amuzikluva @NBA @dallasmavs @luka7doncic They only have one star player.@ThePolyculean @thekezzad @dallasmavs @luka7doncic @kporzee Luka is the superstar setting up everyone else for EASY shots.

High defensive ratings means bad defense. It's basically offensive rating of opposing teams for your team.
