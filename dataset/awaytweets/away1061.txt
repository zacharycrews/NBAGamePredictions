This sounds just like the "thorough investigation" the @trailblazers performed before giving a head coaching job to a credibly accused rapist... Sports teams just don't care about women being assaulted. https://t.co/qZRt6NGdg8@trailblazers PS even an intern would tell you this series of Q&amp;A Tweets without specifying it was from a player a bad idea.

Also thanks for mocking people who pointed that out. Stay classy.

Just n' Idea🤔👇 https://t.co/pn0dwk8nDr@jamol845 @trailblazers If ur focusing on the “better” part of my tweet. I’m using Nurkic to install that. Nurkic, is their X-Factor.

They have the same thing as Warriors have technically, but better👀. GS big 3 is Curry, Klay, Dray. Portland has that same thing with Dame, Simons, and Winslow. Not Nurkic?

If there weren’t people who liked pineapple on pizza, they wouldn’t sell it. 

Personally, the idea of putting tiny salty fish on a pizza sounds weirder to me!@trailblazers First the nfts and now this. Josh Hart has moved outside of my top 4 current Blazers 😔@trailblazers Pepperoni and pineapple is the best combo.Flash giveaway!
