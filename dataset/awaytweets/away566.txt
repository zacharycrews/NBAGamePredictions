Dennis can penetrate the paint better than Marcus and Grant can shoot better than Al. Both of those things open the floor for Jayson and Jaylen.The Brown/Tatum tandem can no longer use youth &amp; inexperience as an excuse for their inability to play winning ball together.

Avoid the repeaters‚Äô tax, play the young guys, get a high draft pick and make a trade in the summer.

It‚Äôs the best strategy available.

Tatum had an off night just couldn't find good shots and couldn't get himself open, 6 of 20 and I think he only has one 3 pointer@DylanHudson5 @great_gatz24 @celtics A third star is not required.
