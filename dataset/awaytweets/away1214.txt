Casuals only say that because they don't know that you can't rotate the ball mid-dribble mid-air nor use a zero step (because it didnt exist) or else the refs will blow their whistles.

And im talking to one now, and he's playing dodgeball.@Tristan21r @BigBossDawg84 @ElfridPayton12 @skrimp_n_grits @SacramentoKings and their statements are consistent with each other. There are a lot of footage about the quickness and athleticism of the old legends. There are a lot of videos explaining the things I'm saying. There are a lot of 60s newspaper articles published online saying the same things.@Tristan21r @BigBossDawg84 @ElfridPayton12 @skrimp_n_grits @SacramentoKings "Fabricated" when you just haven't heard of them lol. Yearly league averages in bball-ref for era inflation. Check Walt Frazier's April Fools joke on Scott Brooks about them having no weight room. All the other stuff, a lot of players and coaches from the time have said those...@3isthenew1 @BigBossDawg84 @ElfridPayton12 @skrimp_n_grits @SacramentoKings Fabricated "facts" from that era. Take anything you hear with a grain of salt unless documented. Westbrook is just faster, stronger and a better finisher. Just watch moves players did back then. Their dribbles, shots, everything is so rudimentary compared to today.@rameenhoss @tweetsbydavelee @Ballislife @SacramentoKings @GrantNapearshow he isn't as good as a shooter as klay but he was a better scorerMinnesota Twins - Seattle Mariners

1. It's not not close
2. Jerry West and Walt Frazier are lockdown defenders at 6'4. There's also Al Attles and KC Jones. Oscar is 6'5. Tom Gola and John Havlicek (who almost played for the Browns) can always switch to guards https://t.co/lYBevXaPsq@3isthenew1 @BigBossDawg84 @ElfridPayton12 @skrimp_n_grits @SacramentoKings Cant strip him off all the work he put into his body, let alone his knowledge.

Lack of post defenders in todays game plus there’d be more of an emphasis on developing his 3 point shot@SactownKingsFan @SacramentoKings @LAClippers Have fun!@NBCSKings The Kings need get a rookie head coach and let him and the team grow up together. I could see Cassell, Atkinson, Ham, and Vanderpool get positive results. The only Sacramento Kings head coaches with any success are Adelman, Malone, Joerger, and Gentry.@SacramentoKings Bobby Jackson would reck everyone…

Midrange, 3s, defense, layup package, the whole entire 9 🥴@Tristan21r @BigBossDawg84 @ElfridPayton12 @skrimp_n_grits @SacramentoKings You had to make your own. Teams didnt have them.

Yes Westbrook will get more PTS/REB because of pace, but on worse efficiency. Assists then were strictly catch-and score. And do you really think he'll outrebound Wilt/Russell/Thurmond/Lucas?

#NBA #gambling #dataanalyst #wealthThe Lakers are only 1.5 games better than the freaking Sacramento Kings this year 🤣🤣🤣 https://t.co/NCASAjKNwdWhen I log off of Twitter, I sometimes become a random sports franchise’s GM in video games at night. I take that shit seriously too, I might rebuild the Sacramento Kings next they need some help. https://t.co/eRc65Kae7Y@hbarnes @SacramentoKings Congratulations!!!@ChillStableGuy hell yea, thank you sacramento kings 🙏🏼@SacramentoKings Y’all breaking records every year congrats@SacramentoKings Thrive ?

The year after they became a MUCH different team and the LAL lucked it out (let's call it this way) in game 7.@valleychief @play_ja3 @SacramentoKings Fuckin bucketNBA Basketball Game Betting Picks Simulator: 9:30 PM ET - Sacramento Kings vs. Los Angeles Clippers - YOU CAN RUN THE GAME SIMULATION FOR FREE HERE: https://t.co/3wzWMR00cb #nba #sportsbetting #freepicks #cappertek@SacramentoKings White chocolate https://t.co/lNcSszGI9t@SacramentoKings Mike Bibby@Justin_RNSFL @SacramentoKings Players today hit those shots. Jason Williams was never a good shooter@gms_pronos @SacramentoKings They haven't been tanking. Kings been trying to make the playoffs for years, there just suck

They just traded a young player for an all star@SacramentoKings Mitch Richmond! 6'5" and strong. Can shoot the lights out and was a good defender.@Nani @SacramentoKings I see you familySacramento chapter of MADD is launching a new effort with the help from the Kings https://t.co/eQZz0fW7MDThings that were better back then:

Deep threes were not a focal point of his game. He’d be a baller in any era but he wasn’t even a good shooter in his era. Especially wouldn’t be today@DragonflyJonez people forget cuz he’s washed now but his ‘17 season was one of the most fun single seasons i’ve ever watched. the King of the Fourth just killing people with the shoulder hesi. dude was an absolute bucket going all the way back to Sacramento@CantTry7 @SacramentoKings Lmao@SacramentoKings Scott Pollard would be dominating These kids. Still Rollin with the bleached hair too@Ballislife @SacramentoKings I miss this dude so much.@SacramentoKings The Rock4/8/97 - Despite Bryant Reeves finishing with 28p/13r, and were tied at half, the Vancouver #Grizzlies (12-66 &amp; 27-133 all-time) fell at the Sacramento Kings 109-93. Shareef: 19p/11r. Rogers: 15p/10r (42min). SAC: Richmond: 26p/5a. Williamson: 24p/3r.

Klay is like a top 5-6 shooter oat. Peja up there tho.@SacramentoKings That whole 2002 team that my Lakers beat in 7@SacramentoKings I loved Peja but watch YouTube and it shows who would be best, White Chocolate, Jason Williams. After all these years, they still show his skills. He was so ahead of his time that he would absolutely be great in the NBA today.@SacramentoKings Bobby Jackson@SacramentoKings Mike Bibby and C WebbConsensus Line Move:

You need at least 5 great 3-ball players. We had that in Buddy Hield and then everybody complained that he needed to do more. Well look what he is doing now in Indiana. I hope all you Buddy haters are happy.
