Good read on how, 50 years ago this month, a preseason game against the NBA champion Milwaukee #Bucks was the beginning of the end for the ABA's Pittsburgh Condors. https://t.co/4TI8SX02xM“We didn’t pay $25,000 for Bob Dandridge.”

I bet a few of these guys are borderline and Milwaukee simply has no interest in pushing things in October.@miaheatbeat @Bucks @MiamiHEAT #BucksCulture means Milwaukee will Play Random and get the job done@miaheatbeat @Bucks @MiamiHEAT We moveSo the @Bucks will be without six players for tonight’s game against the @MiamiHEAT:

Jrue Holiday
Brook Lopez
Donte DiVincenzo
Bobby Portis
Rodney Hood
Semi Ojeleye

Ouch. 😬Another season tips off for the @MiamiHEAT tonight at 8:00 pm as they face the defending champion @Bucks. #NBA📅 On this day in 1976, Hall of Famer Alex English scored four points in his NBA debut with the @Bucks.

English would go on to become one of the most productive scorers in NBA history. He and Karl Malone are the only players to record at least eight straight 2,000-point seasons. https://t.co/yBpRDBR7MWLet’s get this going #HEATTwitter another season tips off tonight for the @MiamiHEAT against the @Bucks at 8:00 pm. #NBAMilwaukee Bucks championship rings offer a unique twist and a whole lot of franchise references - https://t.co/CIDcua8BPD https://t.co/9wihYSjZOcTeams I root for in the East:

As long as Brook Lopez can continue to be playable, the Bucks will always be great. He is probably one of their top 3 most important players in my opinion.@Buccaneers tampa bay view red cat buccaneer!

With DiVincenzo out, Miami’s gonna have to take Nwora into account this game. 15 and 6 last night vs the Nets.

       https://t.co/Bl3iS3yAkY@JLane01 @RuthlessEchoz @RussBrooksGoats @statmuse @Giannis_An34 @Bucks I’m saying that at his peak Malone was never as good as Giannis is right now, and Giannis is only 26. If you’re going by overall stats you are correct, I’m sayinghow dominant they are at their best. Malone was a better midrange shooter, what would that make him better than Shaq?@MaxEnvisions @NBA @Lakers @warriors @Bucks @BrooklynNets these are so dopeMilwaukee Bucks | Wallpaper | Header

😭😭😭 https://t.co/MlkvRwAdVx@JLane01 @RuthlessEchoz @RussBrooksGoats @statmuse @Giannis_An34 @Bucks The assist and 3-Point % numbers say Giannis is a better passer and shooter than Malone. Giannis also has a higher overall FG%, won DPOY, and 2 MVPS. Frankly this isn’t even close.@Bucks We are back😍this is lovely! i wasn't crazy about his approach to team construction or playoff bball, but kohl kept the bucks in milwaukee first when he bought the franchise and again when he sold it. https://t.co/7kNjGyI8ET@KlementSausage @Bucks ooh the beer brats for sure #MadeRightHere@NawojC @NBA @Bucks @warriors If you read the message, I said LeBron cannot do it on his own.
