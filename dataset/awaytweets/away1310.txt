It's just not a part of his game.

Let’s hope home court gets it done for you. I can’t help but think the warriors are going to pinch the clip this season!@ShamsCharania @TheAthletic @Stadium like the news that the Lakers are interviewing former Golden State Warriors head coach Mark Jackson for the next coaching job. This is a great move by the Lakers because Jackson's first and only previously coaching Jarrett was with the Golden State Warriors from 2011 to 2014.@NBAMuse24 @WarriorsMuse @realchriswebber @WigginsMuse @Money23Green @Draymond23Muse @GinaReppinDaBay @GoIdenState @antonin_org @CurryMuse @warriors This is actually a pretty astounding stat..If you think about it, Dirk, didn’t play a bunch in the playoffs, MJ hardly shot 3’s, and Dray’s spent his career in a 3 point renaissance era on the team that MADE that renaissance happen. I LOVE the info, but this isn’t surprising.@warriors Damn @KlayThompson@warriors That's the guy who outclassed John Legend@FckZias @warriors Dude why 😂@kazerodriguez1 @warriors @CurrysW0rld Yep!

This is really lining up for the Warriors, who have gotten serious at the right time.@NBA @warriors @madebygoogle Wrong 2-1 MiamiThe best feeling in the world: @warriors basketball is on tonight!

And imma take a bite at it for sure. 🤠Of course @NBA can fine @dallasmavs for bench decorum but seem to not enforce its on rules against fan profanity against the players.  Point is the @warriors fan and @luka7doncic The fans would not be an issue if not for the continued @NBA fines..@StephenCurry30 @warriors what do you think of @AmandaDTV's new sign off?

Definitely not ideal, but I don’t see why Mavs players standing up on the bench is an issue, ya know? Where does it say that they can’t do that? That’s what a coach wants his players to do, supporting their teammates@SportChamp1000 @ShamsCharania @reddusfoximus @warriors @dallasmavs Whichever Maverick player it is who is standing in the white shirt... Steph threw a pass right at him during the game, thinking he was a teammate. He had to move to the side to avoid getting hit by the pass. I'm done talking about it, this is a waste of time.I predict @Money23Green might get ejected this game and suspended for game 4.

Leaving outside their throwaway Game 5 in Memphis, the Warriors have been by far the most consistent team this postseason.

Warriors ????KEYS TO GAME 3 AT DALLAS:
• Limit turnovers and convert Mavericks’ turnovers into points
• Don’t force shots and use pick and roll to find open looks
• Watch the perimeter and don’t leave shooters open
• Play good defense and play hard

I didn’t say Dallas can’t play defense, I said they can’t protect the rim.

You pulling for Boston or Miami?@stephenasmith -@RealMikeWilbon - @JalenRose yeah those @celtics looked real impressive they look so much better than @warriors #MIAvsBOS #NBAPlayoffs https://t.co/5zjsJVbcOQMaybe I'm overreacting to tonight's game.

But honestly, I can't see a way that the Warriors don't win the NBA Finals.

Would have to sustain a major injury of sorts. Golden State looks like the best team, and healthiest to win a championship.@Audra_Lowe @warriors @celtics I think that's what the matchup will be, especially if Jimmy Butler ends up missing the next game or 2This was a good, gritty basketball game...both teams played hard..enjoyed it...💪👍
But of course, Go @warriors...😏

#MIAvsBOSMannnnn @celtics u can’t be serious down 30 🤯 aye I wanted the bucks to win they put out I allways been a Boston fan but ima keep 1000 @warriors get another ring this year@NBA @warriors Steve Kerr Is a genius@aceves_camacho @NBAonTNT @warriors @_CharlesBarkley That is respect. They're playing along with the game Chuck started decades ago of hating the the Warriors and the Bay Area.Mavs, Warriors, Celtics and Heat. Of the four remaining teams… there’s only one that is still intriguing to watch and dangerous when down 20. For that reason it’s hard for me to believe Golden State won’t end up winning it.@warriors Great tweet.NBA Basketball Game Betting Picks Simulator: 5/22/2022 9:00 PM ET - Golden State Warriors vs. Dallas Mavericks - YOU CAN RUN THE GAME SIMULATION FOR FREE HERE: https://t.co/T5V5NXQKlL #nba #gamblingtwitter #sportsbetting #freepicks #cappertek@warriors @united @Money23Green @KlayThompson good luck 😍😍😍@spoonen @warriors @dallasmavs @luka7doncic I’d rather see this. https://t.co/bJ2CI36ZJd@NBA Can you please review the refereeing? It has been abysmal all season long but it’s really reached a “postseason” level of ineptitude. Tyler Herro makes a clean strip &amp; gets called for a foul? Bad calls in game 2 of @warriors @dallasmavs were plentiful.@purehoop @dallasmavs @warriors You forgot the scar 😂@ballinboiRT @KaptainScorpius @NfTscorpio @bobtheblob_ @PiratesMeta @luka7doncic @nbatopshot @dallasmavs @warriors @NBA Warriors @SteadyBreaks @StephSutto @TheFirstMint@warriors congrats on the sorry ass chip finooksSwitching up the artist this time…

Music: Count Me Out by Kendrick LamarIf it’s a Heat-Warriors finals, I’d be really nervous.

Miami doesn’t have a true superstar; it’s just a really deep team. If Golden State can’t get a good start to open up the game (which has been happening all postseason), it’ll be in deep trouble.@pooleSZN3 @warriors @united He saw you watching. 🥷If there is one thing we can all guarantee right now is that the Golden State Warriors are the best team left in the playoffs. Definitely the favorites to win the title this year. #DubNation https://t.co/EkOvdfjE1g@NBA Who’s playing the drinking game every time Mark Jackson says the word “strength?” 🤣 @celtics @MiamiHEAT @MarkJackson13 @warriors @dallasmavs@NPS12345678 @warriors @united WTF 😤 Let’s see you do it@ballinboiRT @KaptainScorpius @NfTscorpio @bobtheblob_ @PiratesMeta @luka7doncic @nbatopshot @dallasmavs @warriors @NBA Mavericks

Stephen A said he hasn't been impressed with Dubs despite fact their 2 wins from NBA Finals.

NBA | Golden State Warriors 

(h/t GrantLiffman/Twitter) https://t.co/FfuOXzyiC7This game makes you think the @warriors will win this year’s championship. Boston times struggles to make shots and that’s never the problem for a team with shooters both on and off the dribble like the gsw.@aceves_camacho @NBAonTNT @warriors @_CharlesBarkley It’s chase center now. They’re SF not Oakland. But that’s on them, brings good ratings to TNT.@purehoop @dallasmavs @warriors luka lol. this is a good one@sdotcurry hey I have a favor to ask. Me and my wife are adopting to foster a young man from the foster system here in Tn . You are his favorite player in the nba and he’s a huge fan of the golden state warriors. I was going to see if you and teammates would sign something@Money23Green “The Golden State Warriors start three future Hall of Famers, a former No. 1 overall pick …” National wags already have you in The Hall.
