This is a pure contrarian play.

Given how James Harden has looked over the past couple weeks, I legitimately think the Nets are better off without him in the lineup for this game. I like BKN to win, but I like them to cover an inflated spread.

KD's legacy will not be defined if he can't win a title in Brooklyn.@BrooklynNets Not watchingI honestly ain’t even worried about Kevin Durant or the Nets if Harden and Kyrie leave. It’s Brooklyn. It’s Kevin Durant. Plenty of talent will wanna come play there that are

Basketball. NBAI don’t think the Woj report refutes that a trade isn’t happening.

@BrooklynNets was my 2nd team in the east, thats before cancer kyrie came.
