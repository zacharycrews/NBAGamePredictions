Using Twitter, collect and analyze the sentiment of every Tweet for each Home and Away team 24 hours before the tipoff of every NBA game. Use these values as classifiers in predictive models to see if the overall Twitter sentiment before each NBA game provides some statistical advantage towards picking the winner.
